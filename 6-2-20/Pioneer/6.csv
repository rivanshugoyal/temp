0,06-2-20,Hear out the States,"The responsibility of States to attend to displaced people or illegal immigrants cannot be taken away by the Centre assuming for itself a bigger role by a law such as the CAA

India, as defined in Article 1 of the Constitution, is a “union of States.” These States, therefore, are constitutive of the Indian Union and no executive power can be exercised in a manner that undermines their quasi-autonomous status. Even under Article 368, where the Parliament enacts a law, the power of the House is only a “constituent power”, which, though without limitation, only implicitly permits amendments in part-II (citizenship provisions) of the Constitution. The critical question is, can the constituent power of the Parliament in enacting a law override the constituent power of the State in implementing such a law? Given the quasi-autonomous status of the States, are they obliged to blindly comply with a Central law, which creates a conflict with part-III (basic structure) of the Constitution? Many such questions assume great significance in understanding the constitutional provisions and scope of its operation in relation to States, especially with regard to the recent Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Apart from embedded quandaries of the CAA, prima facie, in conflict with Article 14 of the Constitution, the CAA puts the onus of reparation indirectly on States, as the target class of immigrant citizens would have to reside or settle in a State of the Union. Therefore, the constituent power of the Parliament cannot bypass the State in a manner that creates conflict of interest with State(s). The Parliament needs to ensure that existing balance of power and interest is not grossly disturbed by a piece of law.

In Centre-State relations, the Parliament’s capacity to recommend an appropriate course of action in a matter that consequentially affects the State shall run the risk of getting limited by other obligations and interests of the State. A law such as the CAA cannot overwhelm both lex fori and lex loci conditions in relation to States. Obviously, the States remain as both the jurisdictional forum and locus of CAA in terms of its operation, which has to operate through Rules framed under the Citizenship Act of 1955, that necessarily involves officials under the State Government, who are delegated with “procedural” powers to determine who is a citizen.

To put it differently, the responsibility of States to attend to displaced people, who could be legal or illegal immigrants cannot be taken away by the Centre assuming for itself a bigger role by a law such as the CAA. Mere grant of citizenship by the Centre is a form of personal right, which requires the support of a State in entirety to secure all other rights of the citizen, including the right to life, as enshrined under Article 21. Indeed, the CAA in the first instance of its passage in Parliament did recognise lex fori and lex loci conditions by exempting States and areas under the Sixth Schedule from its operation. There remains much scope to fulfil these conditions in framing of rules under the CAA, as Assam and Tripura have State-specific accords to decide on matters of citizenship. The Supreme Court (SC), on its part, distinguishably recognised the case of Assam and Tripura as different from concerns of other parts of the country in relation to the CAA, which is recognition of lex fori and lex loci conditions under which the CAA must operate.

It must also be noted that under Article 13 of the Constitution, laws prior to the commencement of the Constitution such as Foreigners’ Act of 1946 under which the Foreigners’ Tribunals (FT) are ordered in violation of Article 323(b) are inconsistent with part-III of the Constitution and hence it can operate even with CAA framed under Article 368 of the Constitution. This establishes the limited application of the CAA that still requires a much wider framework, apart from its “religious” bias.

Indeed in the case of Assam, operation of the FTs in violation of basic principle of law, namely, “innocent until proven guilty” and its broad sweep of executive discretion in sending someone to a detention camp along with purported operation of the CAA hardly makes a case of consistent application of law. Indeed such inconsistency in operation of the citizenship law is exploited to the extent that a suspected foreigner or an illegal border crosser is often denied right to fair trial, as nothing in law explicitly puts a check and balance on a FT judge from placing a one-sided “onus of proof”, under Section 9 of the FT Act, 1946 on a person claiming to be an Indian citizen in dispute of what the Executive has attributed upon her as a foreigner.

Indeed, the affidavit filed by some of the parties disputing the CAA in the SC refers to this “onus of proof” to be placed upon an immigrant covered under the CAA to make it consistent with the FT Act. In effect, the Code of Civil Procedure that provides right to fair trial and assumes someone not to be guilty until proven guilty is ostensibly a matter of dispute in the case against the CAA that is lying before the SC now, which substantially involves the role of the State in deciding the fate of a suspected foreigner.

So, the SC has to decide on the basis of the principle of “better law” or “more rational law” in the cases filed against the CAA. Additionally, when a State disputes the CAA as a violation of the basic structure of the Constitution, especially the principle of secularism and right to equality before law, the SC has to decide on its jurisdiction as granted by Article 131 of the Constitution.

Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab are raising the same dispute under Article 131. Article 131 clearly stipulated original jurisdiction in any dispute between the Centre and States pertaining to validity of a Central legislation. Independent of the outcome of the case on the CAA, it is to be noted that the right to disputation by a State is a recognised constitutional position that cannot be questioned by raising the issue of prior permission by the constitutional authority of the Governor.

The quasi-autonomous status of the State and full power of the legislature in framing laws under the Seventh Schedule allow for a room of manoeuvering by the States in creative ways without directly contravening a Central law. In a quasi-federal structure like India, there is no “supremacy clause” attached to the Central law, as the Indian Constitution followed a principle of separation of powers guided by a thumb rule of avoiding inequality and imbalance.

This makes it amply clear that there is only an abiding responsibility of the State to follow a Central law without a binding obligation or liability in case the State is not convinced of its correctness. The whole set of issues of federal cooperation and consensus comes into play in enforcing a Central law in case the State concerned sees it as violative of part-III of the Constitution.

What causes the hiatus here is the filtering out of Muslims under the CAA and treating them differently from the rest, in case they have entered India from neighbouring countries covered by the law. Further, exclusion of Tamil immigrants from the purview of the CAA is a potent cause of heartburn in Southern States. The praxis of federalism, being a constantly-developing subject in the world’s large democracies, tells us that distinctions drawn among people on the basis of race, religion, colour, sex, culture and so on are to be disbanded by the State. Hence, in the case of India, no State can be made to practise such distinction and discrimination between people by a Central law, if the State sees it as an incorrect practice. It is correct that in no way can the constituent State of the Union remain non-compliant even if it sees a law giving rise to an incorrect practice, except for approaching the SC to resolve the dispute. However, it is also true that compliance by the State should not violate legal principles of non-discrimination, while denying certain rights to a segment by an established procedure of law. No constitutional law could be bereft of constitutional morality and ethical principle of “no harm” and hence no State could be forced by an executive decree to implement a law that the State sees causing discrimination and harm to a segment in a certain local situation.

The Bommai judgment makes it very clear that the Centre cannot apply “arbitrary powers.” Arbitrary powers here would mean decrees and pronouncements that explicitly subvert a State’s autonomy and jurisdiction of its executives in its own territory. Citizenship Rules, 2003, recognise this executive power of the State by delegating certain crucial powers to the State executive like the District Magistrate. Further, the Bommai Judgment, read with the Sarkaria Commission report, also makes it clear that one of the major sources of arbitrary power lies in “partisan” affairs. When there is no consensus in a bipartisan or multi-partisan sense on the CAA, it does not become non-partisan, as per the language of the Sarkaria Commission, which is the only major commission to examine and understand Centre-State relations in post-independent India. Further, the Inter-State Council, another constitutional body created to resolve any dispute between federal constituents, could discuss the points of contention related to the CAA, which, of course depends on how the respective players raise the matter.

In sum, there is a clear need for check and balance in the operation of executive powers under a Central law, which the CAA certainly warrants. All contentious issues related to the CAA also need a clear resolution in the good federal spirit, giving due importance to the States’ perspectives in the interest of social and political harmony across India.

1,06-2-20,Erdogan has lost the plot,"One small and successful war might benefit the Turkish President by mobilising nationalism but three at once? This is megalomania

Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is not an “Islamist”, in the extreme sense of the word. He doesn’t wear a suicide vest, he doesn’t behead people, he doesn’t get his citizens flogged or stoned, he doesn’t get their hands cut off for theft, he doesn’t even go around holding one finger up in the air to signify his hatred of those who fail to acknowledge the one true God. However, he certainly does like the Islamists a lot. In the heyday of the Islamic State (ISIS) in northern Syria and Iraq, it was Erdogan who kept the Turkish border open so that thousands of foreign fighters and their families could go to join that terrorist proto-state, which was a descendant of Osama bin Laden’s original Al-Qaeda organisation. More recently, Erdogan has stationed Turkish troops in Syria’s Idlib province, the one remaining rebel-held part of the country, where Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, another offshoot of the Al-Qaeda, subjugated all the other rebel organisations last year and now rules unchallenged.

Unchallenged, that is, except by Syrian army troops backed by Russian airpower who are gradually winning back control on the province in a slow, grinding offensive that last week captured Idlib’s second-biggest city, Maarat an-Numan. So it’s no surprise that the Turkish army in Idlib is now firing directly on Syrian forces.

The story is a bit muddy, with Turkey claiming that four of its soldiers in Idlib were killed by Syrian shellfire on Sunday. But the Turkish Government said it had killed 35 Syrian troops in retaliatory fire and Erdogan added: “Those who question our determination will soon understand they made a mistake.”

And, upping the ante further he said that the Assad regime must fall back from Turkey’s observation posts in northwestern Syria this month. “If the Syrian regime will not retreat from Turkish observation posts in Idlib in February, Turkey itself will be obliged to make this happen,” Erdogan told his party’s lawmakers in Parliament on Wednesday.

Erdogan also warned Russia, Syria’s ally, “not to stand in our way.” The Russians will take this seriously since Erdogan deliberately set up an ambush in 2015 and shot down a Russian plane that strayed into Turkish airspace for only 17 seconds.

However, the fact remains that Moscow won’t back down. So, Erdogan is now playing with the dangerous prospect of a shooting war with Syria and Russia. That would be enough on his plate, you might think, but he is also intervening in the civil war in Libya. Erdogan backs the Islamist-dominated Government in the capital, Tripoli, against the rebel army led by General Khalifa Haftar that controls most of the country and he has just sent troops to support it.

The troops are Syrian Arabs, part of the same Islamist puppet army that Erdogan used recently to invade the Kurdish part of Syria. His intervention in Libya puts Turkey into a potential confrontation with France, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, all of which back Haftar. So does Russia.

Not one to be daunted, Erdogan is spouting the same tough-guy rhetoric over Libya: “We will not hesitate to teach a deserved lesson to the putschist Haftar if he continues the attacks on the country’s legitimate administration and our brothers in Libya.” So there’s a few more potential enemies for Turkey. His plate is getting rather full. But Erdogan’s not finished yet. He has also militarised a dispute with Greece and Cyprus over seabed oil and gas reserves, to the extent that Turkish fighter planes are now violating Greek airspace almost daily. And he has demanded that Athens demilitarises 16 Greek islands that are close to the Turkish west coast (making them permanent hostages, totally vulnerable to Turkish invasion).

France has now sent warships to the eastern Mediterranean, and President Emmanuel Macron has explained that “Greece and France are pursuing a new framework of strategic defence.” “Defence” against whom? Turkey, obviously. Who else could it be?

Turkey is still formally a member of NATO, so technically France and Greece are its allies but Erdogan doesn’t seem bothered by that. Neither was he bothered by the fact that the United States (US) is also a NATO member when he invaded northeastern Syria last October to drive the Kurds, America’s key allies in the war against ISIS, from their homes in the border region. He got away with that: The Kurds had served their purpose and Trump just abandoned them to their fate. But is he really wise to take on almost everybody else at once? Like Vladimir Putin in Russia, Erdogan is a strongman ruler who has to win an election every four years. Putin is perennially popular in Russia and wins easily — but Erdogan usually scrapes through with just over half the vote. The country is divided down the middle and the other half loathes him and his Islamist policies.

One reasonably small and successful war might actually benefit Erdogan by mobilising Turkish nationalism but three at once? Against Russian and Syria on one front, France and Egypt on another and Greece plus France and perhaps other NATO and European Union members on a third. He used to be a fairly competent strategist but he has been in power too long (17 years) and he has finally lost the plot. This is megalomania.

2,06-2-20,How climate change births a virus,"The relationship between rising temperatures and increasing spread of viruses has been much researched. The American Society of Microbiology released a report on this in 2010 citing conditions for pandemics

The Coronavirus, with its epicentre in Wuhan, China, is wreaking havoc and creating an immense fear psychosis around the world. In China alone, the virus has infected over 24,391 people and has reportedly caused over 492 deaths according to official estimates.

However, the actual number is believed to be much higher. The alarming speed at which the virus is spreading caused Chinese President Xi Jinping to remark that the nation was fighting a demon. The virus has led many nations to evacuate their citizens from China. The Chinese authorities have deployed emergency measures to contain the spread of the virus by imposing strict travel restrictions and putting certain geographical locations under lockdown, with over 50 million people quarantined.

The spread of lethal viruses has become the new face of climate change and is taking an unimaginable toll on human life even as the international medical community, scientists and disease experts scramble to find a vaccine and contain the coronavirus. Climate change-enabled rise in temperatures has caused the spike in humidity levels that in turn have created a favourable environment for the viruses of the most virulent kind to breed and multiply. The relationship between rising temperatures and increasing spread of viruses has been much researched. The American Society of Microbiology released a report way back in 2010 regarding the relation between the two and how high temperatures play a perfect host to pandemics.

In the background of this virus outbreak, the lack of progress at the recent COP 25 looks like a lost opportunity, as the international environmental community with a great opportunity at hand could not come up with any major development agenda to fight climate change.

Had the world leaders and the environmental community cobbled together an actionable plan that included containment of those precipitating factors that trigger epidemics such as these, the world would have already had a plan in hand to deal with the present crisis.

Be it the SARS virus that impacted China 17 years ago and infected nearly 8,000 people or the Zika virus outbreak in 2016, the role of climate change has always been centric as the enabler of fast-spreading viruses. However, there are other aspects also. For instance, there is an urgent need to manage the triangular relationship between humans, the environment and animals. The inept handling of any one aspect of this can cause a cascading impact on the well-being of all three.

The United States (US) took a risk of sorts when the Trump Administration closed down the Predict Programme that had the research mandate to test animals for dangerous pathogens that could cross over to human beings. The current coronavirus could be an example where the virus strain is in fact believed to have evolved from bat species.

The political leadership, therefore, plays a very important role in either limiting the evolution and subsequent spread of the virus or exposing the human community to the risks of virus by shutting down ongoing research facilities engaged in studying them, as done by the Trump Administration.

The human community has for ages been engaged in a never-ending struggle with diseases and maladies which have challenged and inspired the scientific community to come out with superior medication and vaccines. But the intensity and speed of the virus is now approaching dangerous levels giving lesser and lesser time to the scientific and medical community to respond with an antidote.

As a result of this time lag, precious lives are being lost at an alarming speed. China needs to up its research and development powers and ensure that clear lines are drawn between animal and human interactions so that a virus highway of sorts is not opened between the two.

India, thankfully has remained largely out of the clutches of this present pandemic but the reporting of disease-infected victims is getting uncomfortably closer to home. India must set up a research protocol and a prevention programme and insulate itself against the disease. But more importantly, the global community must unite and ensure that climate change is controlled drastically and does not play host to the virulent viruses of the future.

3,06-2-20,Democracy’s true grit,"India rewrote history by upsetting the conventional wisdom that democracies could exist only in developed nations. Yet our foreign policy undermined our chances

It is speculative how the military parade became the centerpiece in Republic Day celebrations at Rajpath. The Republic Day commemorates January 26, 1950, the day the bulk of the Constitution of India came into force. The armed forces had no role in its making and the text nowhere refers to them. However, given the robust traditions of an apolitical army, institutionalised by the British, there was never a conflict between the civilian government and the military in India. No doubt General K.M. Cariappa (Retd), India’s first Chief of Army Staff, had blurted out in 1971 that the Constitution should be scrapped, and India should be placed under military rule, at least temporarily, “to put things right in the country.” But he never lost his credentials or post-retirement benefits on account of such sacrilege. He was still invested with the Five Star General Rank or Field Marshal by the President. That is the beauty of democracy.

In contrast, the United States of America, the world’s oldest modern democracy, took long to reconcile itself with the necessity of a large standing Army. The Army, unlike the Navy, was perceived as a potential threat to the civilian government. This is despite the fact that the first US President, George Washington, had been a reputed general himself. When the US got accidentally drawn into the World War I on April 6, 1917, its standing Army was a constabulary force of 127,151 in addition to a national guard of 181,620. Though it expanded to 3.68 million troops within 18 months of WWI, it again shrunk to a size of 125,000 personnel between 1919 and 1939, the smallest for any great power.

The World War II inflated the size of the Army to 8.3 million troops, about five million of whom were posted overseas. It is estimated that 12 per cent of the US population served in some branch of the military during the WWII. As the Cold War followed the World War II, the US came to rely on its military superiority as a means of protecting the “free world.” The military pacts like NATO, ANZUS, CENTO and SEATO became the order of the day.

In the post-WWII phase, both India and the US demonstrated a divergent approach towards democracy and militarisation. India became the world’s largest democracy based on a universal adult suffrage. But this status found little reflection in the nation’s foreign policy. The significance of India becoming a democracy was never fully realised. By the end of WWII, there were only 12 democracies left in the world, down from all 29 in 1926, courtesy the rise of authoritarian regimes based on fascism and Nazism. The defeat of the Axis Powers signalled a process of re-democratisation. But the Russian victory also meant expansion of Communism, which sealed the fate of re-democratisation in a number of countries in WWII. Writing in 1950, John Foster Dulles, later to be US Secretary of State, says, “Already Soviet Communism has extended its control over more than 700,00,000 people, or about, one third of the human race. This has happened in thirty three years. Never before have so few gained so much, so fast (War or Peace, P.2).” Dulles, when he became Secretary of State (1953-59), favoured the policy of “liberation” of East Europe and other communist-dominated regions, as against the “containment” theory of his predecessor Dean Acheson.

At a time when one-third of humanity was somehow under the sway of Communism, it was no mean achievement to bring one sixth of humanity to the light of democracy. This political “miracle” happened in India. As a result of the first general elections in 1951-52, India’s 36.5 crore population (as per Census, 1951) came alive under a parliamentary democracy. India rewrote history by upsetting the conventional wisdom that democracies could exist only in industrially developed, affluent and educationally forward nations.

India and the US should have enjoyed the best of relations based on the common factor of democracy. But if the relationship had failed to take off in the first place during Nehru’s visit to the USA (1949) during Harry S. Truman’s presidency, the relationship actually plummeted during the first three years of Eisenhower administration (1953-56). The reason was despite Eisenhower’s sympathy for the third world, his Secretary of State Dulles was inflexible and dogmatic about democracy. India was no doubt the world’s largest democracy. But it refused to be its standard bearer on the world stage. Nehru’s pronounced Marxist leanings were traceable at least since 1927 when he had participated in the International Congress against Colonial Oppression and Imperialism in Brussels, Belgium. At this conference, Nehru had “come around to the Marxist viewpoint in broad essentials. He agreed that imperialism and capitalism went hand in hand, and neither would disappear until both were put down (S. Gopal, Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography, Vol-1, P.101).” Nehru had been to Moscow in 1927 to participate in the decennial celebrations of the October Revolution, 1917.

Dulles felt India was running with the hares and hunting with the hounds. During the Korean War (1950-53), the US had militarily intervened to save a democratic South Korea from being overrun by a communist North Korea. India’s foreign policy during the Korean War was perceived as scattered and confused. Nehru as the External Affairs Minister, B.N. Rau in the UNO, High Commissioner V K Krishna Menon, Ambassador Vijay Laxmi Pandit and Ambassador K.M. Pannikar in Beijing were pulling in different directions. China entered the Korean War on the side of North Korea in October, 1950. But Nehru was seen lobbying for the Republic of China’s seat in UN Security Council, when it was not even a member of the UN till 1971. Ironically, Mao’s China at that moment was also busy annexing Tibet, with grave security repercussions for India itself.

India never allowed its armed forces to be used for the defence of a “free world” that the US might have liked. In 1955, India fashioned its greatest foreign policy statement, much to the chagrin of the US. It along with 28 other nations formed the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) at the Bandung Conference (April 18-24, 1955) in Indonesia. The NAM was mostly an assortment of newly de-colonised nations of Africa and Asia, which did not want to be part of any bloc (East or West) or sign military pacts. Not all founding members of the NAM were democratic. Countries like Yugoslavia and Cuba were communist, though not part of the Eastern Bloc. Democracy was not part of the 10-point NAM Charter (an expansion of Nehru’s five principles of Panchashila). Democracy was first adopted by the NAM as a guiding principle in 2006, at the Havana Conference, ironically in a country (Cuba) that itself has no democracy till date.

In 1955 itself, India began its lasting relationship with the USSR, occasioned by the visit of Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin to India, and Nehru’s return visit to Moscow. The relationship between the world’s two largest democracies became all the more complex. India’s status as the world’s largest democracy and its foreign policy were out of sync. But so it was for the USA, which in pursuit of saving the “free world,” can support the military dictatorship of Park Chung-hee in South Korea but overthrow a democratically elected Mohammed Mosaddegg in Iran or President Salvador Allende in Chile. Those were the crude realities of the Cold War.

4,06-2-20,NRC on hold?,"This may just be a placatory gesture and will be back given the BJP’s performance in State polls

For long, the ruling establishment has demonised the countrywide protests over the citizenship law as anti-national betrayal, an elitist-liberal conspiracy and an attack on the Hindu way of life. The party with a difference at the Centre has been trying to convince the nation that existing templates of governance needed to be overturned to effect such a change and years of minority appeasement had to be replaced with majoritarian resentment. But if it was so sanguine about the sporadic nature of dissent, then what could explain a temporary reversal of its stand on the National Register of Citizens (NRC)? Clearly the sound and fury signify something for the Government to at least halt its missionary zeal to go for a profiling-based census or justifying it as a way of rooting out illegal immigrants. Clearly, a civil society movement has generated such a swell among common citizens across India, from students to grannies, from working class to labourers, and affected the nation’s productivity cycle to such an extent that the BJP feels its ramrod aggression is costing it politically. Combined with the venom of the hate speeches flying thick and fast and the morally reprehensible sedition and inquiry brought against students and teachers of a school play, the strong agenda push has even left its apologists and defendants somewhat red-faced. The civil unrest across the country has given us a primary lesson in democracy, that people may make ideological choices but are largely against societal deconstruction driven by political imperatives. And the country cannot be in a perpetual state of a war with itself. For long, the Right has played the victim card as a recipient of the Leftist-socialist and Congress oppression. Now that it has a brute electoral majority, that narrative is well past its expiry date. And it must realise that the people’s verdict needs to be respected, that it needs to be trusted as a deliverer and not just be an avenger. It must realise that its manifesto cannot become the nation’s own. That’s why the latest Home Ministry clarification in Parliament that there was no plan for the NRC shows the Government has been stung, temporarily at least. For it comes at a time when senior BJP Ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah, and even Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath — who has been consolidating the Hindu votebank in mathematical terms in his State and raising the ghostly invasion by “others” — have made no bones about the need to isolate illegal settlers, namely Muslims. It also proves that the Government’s effort to treat the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in isolation isn’t quite working. If the longevity of the protests, particularly Shaheen Bagh, has proven anything, it is that people are not against rehabilitating Hindu returnees, they are against the legacy hunt process, which may disqualify Muslims from the NRC list, who may not have redressal under CAA in the way an excluded Hindu would have. It is the otherisation and genocidal instincts implicit in the CAA that has riled up people. Which is why the pressure on the Government has been immense, such that Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose to publicly overrule his deputy and Home Minister Amit Shah. Now the PM’s reassurance on “no NRC now” has been given official credibility.

But does this mean that the BJP is still pursuing its forked tongue approach? Is it rescuing Modi as a thinking patriarch and, therefore, he has to appear more statesmanlike while Shah and motormouths continue to be aggressors and somewhat recalcitrant members of the Sangh? Modi’s clarification that the NRC had not been discussed in the Government made light of Amit Shah’s statement in Parliament. Many loyalists argued that the PM was not present in the House when the legislation was placed, but can any legislative or policy matter be placed in the House without it having been discussed in the Government at all? This orchestrated rift between Modi and others has frankly been overplayed. Fact is, the cessation of NRC is but temporary to offset general fury over the country’s economic slowdown. The CAA-NRC project was part of the BJP manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Shah as BJP president then had promised to bring the CAA first and then implement the NRC. Frankly, with the abrogation of Article 370 and the Ram temple a reality, the BJP is left with very few promises to dangle and nurture the Hindu dream of a promised land. The NRC, therefore, is in abeyance. If the BJP blasts the citadel in the Delhi elections, it will be back. Even if it doesn’t, there will be some subtle State-level experiments for sure.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nrc-on-hold--2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/nrc-on-hold-.html
5,06-2-20,Rajnath unveils 3P strategy for defence manufacturing,"In a bid to make India a defence manufacturing hub, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh unveiled a 3P strategy—Policy, Production and Partnership — at the ongoing DefExpo 2020 in Lucknow on Wednesday

Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Singh said, “The sheer magnitude and scale of defence expo endeavour is symbolically representative of the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government for a New India that aims to emerge as a powerhouse in defence manufacturing. The essence of our initiative can be collectively termed as 3P strategy — Policy, Production and Partnership.”

The event touched new heights with the presence of defence ministers from 40 countries, more than 165 foreign firms and around 1,000 exhibitors.

“As part of our efforts to unleash the potential in defence production, we have liberalised foreign direct investment (FDI) cap to 49 per cent through the direct route, and above that up to 100 per cent through the government route,” he added.

“We have already started single window clearance for setting up industries. Alongside, we have made improvements in infrastructure development, skilling manpower and advancing connectivity,” Singh said.

Defence ministers of India and African nations will hold their conclave on Thursday, which is happening for the first time.

“The India-Africa Defence Ministers Conclave is also a proof of how big and important the platform has become in terms of bringing together and connecting technological innovation and business opportunity,” the defence minister said.

On Make in India and Offset policy, Singh said, “We are committed to enhancing our defence production through Make in India and Offset policy. This aims at integrating India’s defence industry with major foreign OEMs, providing Indian companies an opportunity to produce world-class components.”

Singh also said that India did not seek to create strategic dependencies by way of becoming a defence manufacturing hub.

“As a responsible power, India also believes that the export of defence equipment should not seek to create strategic dependencies but instead meet the legitimate needs of importing nations and contribute to the cause of peace and security,” the defence minister said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rajnath-unveils-3p-strategy--for-defence-manufacturing.html
6,06-2-20,5 members of family killed road mishap,"In a tragic road mishap, five members of a family, including three children, were killed when their car fell in the Ganga river near Chatru Aharpur village in Indergarh area of Azamgarh early Wednesday morning.

Three of the car occupants were injured while one child was missing.

As per reports, Gaurav of Thathiya hamlet in Kannauj went to Barhi village of Talgram by car to attend the ring ceremony of a kin. He was accompanied by wife Pappi, daughters Lado and Priya and Mohini, Krishna, Rekha Devi, Subhi and another acquaintance.

During their return trip, while their car was passing through Indergarh in the wee hours of Wednesday, the driver lost control after which the vehicle fell in the Ganga river.

Hearing the screams of the drowning family members, the local villagers rushed to the scene and informed the police about the mishap.

Later, a rescue team rushed there and managed to extricate three of the injured besides the bodies of five of the family, who had died by then.

The initiative, which will impact 4,300+people of the area, aims to reduce the consumption of firewood by 50% and develop alternate sources of fuel thereby maintaining the ecological balance of the reserve. The adoption of this energy efficient cooking medium will not only reduce emissions but is also expected to bring down instances of respiratory diseases prevalent amongst the tribal women.

As a part of the project, PwC India Foundation will also help in preparing the forest land for planting of native trees, especially fruit bearing, which will further protect the ecological equilibrium of the area.

Satyavati Berera, Chief Operating Officer, PwC India said, “PwC Foundation is committed to address the climate crisis and we’re happy to play a part in maintaining the ecological balance of Kanha Tiger Reserve.

It is fulfilling for us to work alongside non-profits in rural heartlands, across diverse habitats, to bring about a sustainable change in the way marginalised communities are adapting to climate change.”

In the last three years, PwC India Foundation has worked in eight States, impacting over 2,600 beneficiaries and empowering communities to conserve their natural ecosystems.

11,06-2-20,Uma to contest LS poll in 2024,"Former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and former Union Minister Uma Bharti here on Wednesday announced that she would contest Lok Sabha election in 2024.

While talking to media persons, she said, “When I had announced not to contest 2019 LS polls, I had in the same breath stated that I would fight election in 2024.” She, however, did not specify from which State she would prefer to contest the election.

“When I decided not to contest poll in 2019, I did not say I won’t contest a poll ever,” said Bharti, adding she has decided to work for Ganga cleaning and Ram temple construction so she would contest the election in 2024.

She further said that now, she has prepared herself for an election.

These days, Bharti is recuperating from a leg fracture she picked up in the recent past. In the last one year and a half, Bharti mostly has been spending time close to the banks of river Ganga.

The Congress was quick to poke senior BJP leaders over Bharti’s return. “Those who were delighted after Uma Bharti’s decision not to contest poll and kept her on the sidelines in last 15 years are going to lose their sleep after her announcement. Shivraj ji, Rakesh Singh (BJP State head) beware,” Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja said.

Notably, in the 2014 elections, Bharti was elected as an MP from Jhansi and later announced not to contest the poll ahead of 2019 citing health reasons.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/uma-to-contest-ls-poll-in-2024.html
12,06-2-20,Return of the cheetah,"With shrinking habitats and a reduced prey base, translocating this cat species isn’t a good idea

Following the green signal by the Supreme Court, India will soon be reintroducing cheetahs into the wild by flying in the carnivore from Africa, over 50 years after the animal was declared extinct in the country in 1952. That it was a tragedy and a big loss to our biodiversity that we hunted and caged the beautiful animal into extinction, is undisputed. But the fact remains that the cheetah is the only big cat to have gone extinct in India. What is lost is lost. Now we need to focus on the other large carnivores that we still have and try and save them the best we can. And given our meagre resources, can we really afford to take on this project? We have 20 species that are on the brink, with the Asiatic lion, tigers, Indian wolf, the great Indian bustard, the Asian wild buffalo, Jerdon’s courser and the red panda being among them. Except for 50 reserves that come under Project Tiger, the allocation for all wildlife habitats and 21 endangered species was a mere `497 crore between 2017-20. Over 10 years ago, the cost of the cheetah project was estimated at `300 crore. So, where will we get the funds to conserve the cheetahs from? Will we rob the snow leopard of its chance of survival to pay for the cheetah’s reintroduction? Also, what is the guarantee that the exotic, yet very vulnerable cat, will be able to survive in India?

As it is, the number of cheetahs is on the decline globally with just 7,100 left in the wild, having been driven out of 91 per cent of their habitats. Asia has been the worst offender where its decimation is concerned. India’s last spotted cheetah died in 1947. There are less than 50 of them left in Iran and now the majority of this shy and secretive feline lives in six southern African countries. Have all the proponents of the idea of bringing the cheetah back thought why the animal is on the verge of becoming extinct elsewhere? It’s because this cat is hard to protect. Being the fastest animal in the world, cheetahs need a very wide range for hunting prey. So according to researchers, an estimated 77 per cent of a cheetah’s habitat would be outside protected zones, making it difficult to keep them safe from poachers, vehicular traffic and rural populations. This is also a very big impediment to monitoring its progress and well-being. This problem is further compounded by the man-animal conflict. India certainly doesn’t have the prey base or the ranges required for the survival of a translocated species. Unless we want the cheetah to die here, this idea doesn’t seem good enough.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/return-of-the-cheetah-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/return-of-the-cheetah.html

“A backward should also be given a post in the trust,” Kalyan Singh told reporters in Lucknow.

Congratulating Modi and Shah for the decision, Singh said: “It was my dream to see a Ram temple in Ayodhya. With this, my dream will come true. Setting up of Ram temple trust and allotment of five acres land for the construction of a mosque is appreciable.”

Singh (88), was the chief minister of UP when Babri mosque was demolished on December 6, 1992. He was also accused in the violence.

“We have scarified a lot for Ram temple and now after several decades, our dreams are coming true,” said the BJP leader, who was sent to jail for a day and paid a fine of Rs 2,000 for the demolition of the Babri mosque.

“The CBI also charged me in the conspiracy for the demolition of the mosque and if proved guilty, I will have to go to jail,” Singh said.

When asked if he wanted a place in the trust, the former chief minister said,” I am satisfied and don’t need any new posts now.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kalyan-singh-wants---a-backward-in--ram-temple-trust.html

Yogi said that these agreements would create employment opportunities for 3,00,000 people and fetch investments worth Rs 50,000 crore for UP Defence Manufacturing Corridor spanning six nodes at Lucknow, Kanpur, Jhansi, Chitrakoot, Aligarh and Agra.

The chief minister was addressing a gathering after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated India’s largest ever DefExpo 2020.

“The DefExpo in Lucknow is a big achievement for UP,” the chief minister said while thanking Prime Minister Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who is also the local member of Parliament (MP).

“After UP was awarded the defence manufacturing corridor by Prime Minister Modi in 2018, we formulated our defence and aerospace policy and created a large land bank of 25,000 acres in the six nodes,” he informed the gathering.

The chief minister claimed that owing to better connectivity in UP and improved law and order, the state has emerged as a preferred investment destination, and the DefExpo would further fuel its forward march.

Yogi stressed that the government was striving hard to speed up infrastructure development and build a network of mega expressways.

“While, two expressways — Yamuna Expressway and Agra-Lucknow Expressway — are operational, two other expressways — Purvanchal Expressway and Bundelkhand Expressway — are touted to be thrown open for public use in the next couple of years,” he claimed.

18,06-2-20,PM sets $5 billion defence exports target for next 5 yrs,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated India’s largest ever DefExpo 2020 in Lucknow on Wednesday, setting a target of defence exports worth $5 billion (Rs 35,000 crore) in the next five years.

Stressing the need for India to attain self-reliance in military requirements to face present and future security challenges, Modi said that unless the country controlled its massive defence import bill, the dream of becoming a $5-trillion economy would not be realised.

“India has been a major military power in the past but post-Independence, the country failed to capitalise on its historical capabilities of indigenously producing its defence needs. India is the largest democracy in the world, has the second largest army, fifth largest economy and is also the biggest arms importer. How long can we heavily rely on imports?” the prime minister asked.

However, the prime minister observed that India’s pursuit of self-reliance was to secure its national interests, especially against the backdrop of threats it faced in the region, and was not targeted against any nation.

“India never had expansionist ambitions and never attacked any country nor will we ever do it. Besides, our own defence, we have also obligations towards the security of our neighbours in Indian Ocean region. We are not interested in warfare but welfare,” Modi pointed out.

The prime minister said that from defence exports valued at Rs 2,000 crore a few years back, the nation had achieved defence exports worth Rs 17,000 crore so far. “But our target is to hit exports of $5 billion in the next five years,” he said.

“India has always been a trusted partner for world peace and contributed during the two World Wars despite having no direct stakes in these conflicts. Nearly 6,000 Indian security personnel were currently deployed in the UN Peacekeeping missions in African nations,” Modi said.

Underlining the aim of ‘Make in India’ for India and the world, the prime minister said that DefExpo 2020 was now among the biggest defence shows globally and would contribute immensely towards showcasing India as an ideal investment destination for defence and military hardware.

“India is not only a big market but offers huge business opportunities,” Modi told foreign investors and assured them that their investments would provide good returns and help India become self-reliant in defence needs.

The prime minister further said that Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was helping defence sector start-ups to scale up and develop new products based on modern technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) etc.

Meanwhile, Modi espoused the development of defence manufacturing capacity in domestic private sector and talked about enabling policies, including liberal licensing regime, implemented by the Central government and defence establishments to promote collaboration.

“The DRDO is facilitating free transfer of defence technologies and has created five new testing labs for start-ups to promote innovation,” he said.

Referring to Defence Manufacturing Corridors in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, Modi said that these hubs would not only help India become self-reliant in defence manufacturing but also help micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME).

He said that Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was exploring outer space for public welfare and not for warfare, while DRDO was developing capabilities to protect these outer space assets from potential threats.

The prime minister said that his government had introduced several reforms in the Defence Ministry and implemented ease of doing business (EODB) resulting in sharp increase in number of licences issued by the ministry from 210 to 460 in the last five years.

“India today is building several defence equipment like artillery guns, aircraft carriers, submarines, frigates, light combat aircraft and combat helicopters,” he said.

Modi cited misuse of technology, terrorism and cyber threat as challenges facing the world and said that defence forces were eyeing new technology considering new threats.

“India is not behind others. A roadmap has been finalised to use application of artificial intelligence in defence sector,” he said.

Modi said that the creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff and Department of Military Affairs would boost the overall defence production.

Earlier, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh made a detailed presentation of the plans of his ministry and said that it was pursuing three Ps – policies, promotion and partnership.

The 11th edition of biennial DefExpo 2020 during February 5-9 will feature 1,000 exhibitors, including 165 foreign companies from the US, France, Germany, Russia, Israel, Australia etc., making it the largest ever defence show surpassing the 10th edition of DefExpo 2018 in Chennai, when about 700 exhibitors participated.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pm-sets--5-billion-defence--exports-target-for-next-5-yrs.html

26,06-2-20,Politics heats up over extension of last date of paddy procurement,"Paddy politics in the state is once again on the boil with opposition BJP objecting on the statement of Food and Civil Supplies Minister Amarjeet Bhagat that in no case the government was going to extend the last date of procuring the paddy.

Notably, now only ten days are left for the last date for the procurement and weather is playing spoilsport for farmers to bring their produce to the procurement center.

State’s former chief minister Raman Singh and Leader of Opposition in the state assembly, Dharamlal Kaushik in separate statements have criticised the statement of the minister and reminded that the government had promised to procure each and every grain of the farmers.

Singh in the statement quoting the statement of Food Minister charged Congress government of unsympathetic over the woes of farmers and demanded for extending the last date of procurement for another 15 days.

Meanwhile, contradictory statements are coming from the ministers of the state government. Senior minister T.S. Singhdeo on one hand said that the concerned department should sympathetically look into the grievances of the farmers and appropriate actions must be taken for the procurement from all the farmers.

On the other hand the school education minister Premsai Singh, in a statement had asked the farmers to be patient as the government would procure all of their produce well within the stipulated time frame.

Notable, February.......? is the last date of procurement of paddy from the registered farmers of the state and still produce of more than 3 lakh state farmers are yet to be brought to the procurement centers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/politics-heats-up-over-extension-of-last-date-of-paddy-procurement.html
27,06-2-20,LIC has robust financial health,"The financial health of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is robust and is doing exceptionally well, but it is the Government which requires support to maintain its falling economy. This is why it decided to ‘sell-out’ of stake in LIC, said Mukesh Bhadouria, General Secretary of Bhopal Division Insurance Employees’ Association. “We would hold mass campaign to reach the masses and leaders of political parties, along with elected and selected representatives, to garner support in the selling of LIC stake,” he added.

There is nothing hidden agenda in our protest. Our ideology is clear that in the public interest, public asset made from public money, should not be disturbed or disposed at any cost.

The quantity and quality of assets LIC owns is best in the country. Despite this, the government wants to sell stake and this is not acceptable. Bhadauria further said that at present around one fourth of the Government’s investment is made by LIC and this is in such an excellent shape that there is no need of any kind of distortion. The indications which were given in the Budget were of around 10 percent of the LIC stake would be listed in the form of IPO but it is not the point as selling partial or full do not matters, the question is to make public sector companies private by the route of investments. The Joint Front meeting at National level would be held to discuss and devise strategy for further protest as without protest there is less possibility of government rolling back the proposed sell out. The formation of LIC was very clearly defined as to maintain transparency and honesty in transactions and business which the private players of the field failed to deliver.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lic-has-robust-financial-health.html

31,06-2-20,Khattar approves 13 projects,"Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has accorded approval for the implementation of 13projects under the Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) in six districts of the State.

The districts are Hisar, Bhiwani, Mahendragarh, Rewari, Ambala and Yamunanagar, a spokesperson of the State Government said on Wednesday.

Under these projects, 76 micro watersheds would be set up in the State at a cost of `71.13 crore. The 13 projects would be implemented over the next seven years.

The main objective of IWMP is to restore ecological balance by harnessing, conserving and developing degraded natural resources such as soil, vegetation cover and

water. “The area of these districts are most fragile and vulnerable and required watershed management interventions to address the problem and for sustainable development of the area. The project area of Hisar, Bhiwani, Mahendergarh, and Rewari district are predominantly Sandy loam to sandy clay loam in texture having undulating topography with poor organic carbon and low water holding capacity,” the statement said.

The annual rainfall of these districts varies from 300-550 mm which is highly erratic in nature and lack of assured irrigation in these districts generally restricts the choice of the crops and cultivars.

All these factors coupled with deep and poor quality groundwater, moderate to severe sheet and gully erosion and poor vegetative cover resulting into poor productivity of the crops impacting the socio-economic condition of the people of the area.

The spokesman said that the Project area of Ambala, and Yamuna Nagar districts are mainly sandy loam to sandy clay loam in texture having an admixture of gravel and level to sloppy erosive topography. Annual rainfalls in both the districts are ranging from 1,000-1,200 mm.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/khattar-approves-13-projects.html

In a letter addressed to Minister for Coal and Mines Prahlad Joshi, Chief Minister pointed toward the M.M.D.R Act 1957 and requested him to revise the royalty rates of major minerals after a period of every three years.

He has further affirmed that the state of Chhattisgarh is losing its mineral revenue due to non-increase in royalty rates in every three years, which thereby leads in creating difficulty for proper implementation of state-run welfare schemes due to shortage of funds.

“Royalty is an important source of revenue for the state of Chhattisgarh. Many welfare schemes are being run by the state government for public interest and for this, proper financial management is necessary for its smooth functioning. The revenue receipts are being adversely affected due to non-revision of the royalty rates of major minerals by the Government of India,” CM Baghel said in the letter.

The Chief Minister has informed that the royalty rates of major minerals were revised on September 1, 2014 by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India. As per the provisions of section of the Act, royalty rates were to be revised from September 1, 2017, after a period of three years from the previous amendment, but till date the royalty rates have not been revised.

40,06-2-20,Doon Police nab duo with leopard pelt,"Two men were caught by the Dehradun police with a leopard pelt. Addressing the media, deputy inspector general/Dehradun senior superintendent of police Arun Mohan Joshi informed that some days ago, confidential information was received from the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau about a gang of wildlife contraband smugglers being active in the Cantt police station area. Taking serious cognisance of this, Joshi directed formation of a police team which undertook a special campaign. On Tuesday night, the team received information about two persons arriving in Anarwala with a leopard pelt to sell. Acting on the tip off, the police arrested two men with a leopard pelt, seized their motorcycle and booked them under the Wildlife Protection Act.

The pelt was ascertained to be of a leopard estimated to be about eight to 10 years old. The duo arrested by the police was identified as Chakrata natives Dharm Singh and Chander Singh Chauhan. During questioning, the two said that they were experiencing financial difficulties and hence planned to poach wild animals and sell their pelts and parts. Some months ago, they shot a leopard in the jungles of Chakrata. They first attempted to sell the pelt and body parts of the leopard in Chakrata but couldn’t find buyers due to fear of the police. Then they came to Dehradun trying to sell the leopard pelt when they were caught by the police.

The two accused will be presented in the court, added Joshi. The leopard pelt seized is about eight feet long and five feet wide with an estimated price of about `5,00,000.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/doon-police-nab-duo-with-leopard-pelt.html

According to school teacher Ratan Singh, “I pass through this route daily and I noticed that the clocks of Clock Tower were not working since Sunday evening and it was same on Monday as well as on Tuesday.

It is very disheartening to know that despite being such an important monument of our State, it took three days for the administration to even know that there is something wrong with the clocks.”“For more than twelve years, the clocks of clock tower were dead and were renovated only last summer and that too suffered a glitch within first six months. I am living here for more than fifty years and it is shameful that people do not give importance to the Clock Tower. It is a heritage that needs to be respected and preserved,” said ex-serviceman Dhan Singh Jeena.

College student Jaya Bhandari said, “I don’t know for exactly how long the clocks were not working but I noticed it on Monday and on Tuesday noon they were working but showing the wrong time.” It is pertinent to mention here that the six new clocks were installed last year in Clock Tower after about a decade of the clocks being non-functional.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/clock-tower-clocks-repaired-after-glitch.html

54,06-2-20,Sidhu absent from Delhi campaign despite star campaigner,"Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu continues to sit in the pavilion without stepping into the political field for playing his innings in the electoral match at Delhi.

In hibernation since the surfacing of his differences with Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh over six months back, the real crowd-puller Sidhu has, so far, stayed away from batting for the Congress party in the national capital, even as the campaigning enters its last day on Thursday, February 6.

The charismatic Sidhu’s name was included in the list of 40 star campaigners. In fact, Sidhu was among the only three political leaders from Punjab included in the list, other than Capt Amarinder and All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge and Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Singh Nagra. No Cabinet Minister from the State was included in the list, even though many of them have been campaigning in the national Capital.

Soon after the appearance of Sidhu’s name, his “fans” started looking forward to hear “thoko taali” and other rhetoric from him. But, they have, by and large, been disappointed with Sidhu’s apparent disinclination to stand before the mic during the election rallies.

It was believed that Sidhu may finally come out of his self-imposed exile and give the much-need boost to the party’s electioneering in the national capital city.

With now just a day left for campaigning for February 8 polls, chances are that he may still not campaign for the party despite the fact that the party high command had reportedly also asked Sidhu to participate in the campaigning.

Even as many party leaders, till a few days ago, were expressing hope that Sidhu would join the campaigning, but now they have also started to believe that he would not show up.

With Punjabis making more than 35 percent voters in Delhi, and being influential voters on around 25-28 assembly seats, the role of party leaders from Punjab holds significance for the Congress which is looking for making a comeback in the state which it ruled for 15 years successively.

Notably, Sidhu had only recently made a mark for himself with the Sikh population at the time of the opening of the Kartarpur Sahib corridor and is being seen as a face that can stabilise the party’s wobbly ship in the rough political waters.

Known to share close proximity with Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, Sidhu went into deep political hibernation after he formally resigned from Punjab Cabinet in July 2019. His decision was in protest against the “punishment” of changing his portfolio when the Chief Minister blamed the former cricketer for party’s not-so-good performance in the urban pockets during 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

As Sidhu has been maintaining distance with the party and also limiting his public appearances since then, a section of party leaders wanted him to be back in the political mainstream, at least for the party. Reports were that the party high command wanted “sidelined” Sidhu to give his “due place”. In fact, reports were that he would be appointed Deputy Chief Minister — something Capt Amarinder would stoutly oppose.

Notably, owing to his cold war with Capt Amarinder in the run up to 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Sidhu campaigned for the party in Punjab only on the last two days, that too when he addressed hundreds of rallies and public meetings across the nation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sidhu-absent-from-delhi-campaign-despite-star-campaigner.html

65,06-2-20,AAP seeks termination of PPAs,"Cornering the Capt Amarinder Singh Government over hefty electricity tariff in Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday sought abrogation of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in the ensuing budget session of the Assembly to save the people of the State groaning under ‘power shocks’ from an open ‘loot’ by power mafia.

Party MLAs, including the Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, Sunam MLA Aman Arora, and Barnala MLA Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer, referring to a two-page letter shot off to the Government by a senior IAS officer KBS Sidhu, openly demanded nixing of anti-State PPAs.

They questioned why the Capt Amarinder Government was running away from initiating steps in this regard.

“AAP’s Bijli Andolan had elicited humongous response from the people, prompting senior leaders of the party, including ministers, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, former power minister Rana Gurjit Singh, state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar, along with other legislators and Rajya Sabha members Partap Singh Bajwa to corner their own Government to cancel the PPAs in the interest of the State and its people.

Cheema said that during the long tenure of the SAD-BJP Government in the State, SAD president Sukhbir Badal had inked “one-sided” and “anti-State” pacts with private players by forcing closure of the Government thermal plants generating sufficient and cheaper electricity, which led the people of the State to face the heat of high power cost. KBS Sidhu’s letter had touched upon these vital points in details, he added.

Arora alleged that the Capt Amarinder had, surpassed the Badals in sharing ‘booty’ from the private thermal plants through powerful power mafia calling the shots in the State.

Referring to the letter by KBS Sidhu, Arora said that if Capt Amarinder Government, during its last tenure, could cancel the agreements inked with the States of Haryana, Rajasthan and Union Government on water sharing, why couldn’t he terminate pacts with private thermal plants?

Arora further alleged that if electricity could be procured from the market and the national grid at the cost Rs 3 per unit and Rs 3.15 per unit, why should it be purchased from private thermal plants at an exorbitant rate of Rs 8 to 9 per unit?

Meet Hayer, who is also party’s Bijli Morcha coordinator, said that the people of the State couldn’t heave a sigh of relief from the high power tariff until or unless the costly power pacts were not canceled.

He cautioned that if the Captain Government failed to cancel the PPPs, AAP, if formed the Government in the State in 2022, would crack a whip on the private power players and expedite the termination of the PPAs.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-seeks-termination-of-ppas.html

69,06-2-20,Food Safety Dept asked to ensure jaggery’s quality production,"Punjab Health and Family Welfare Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, after reviewing the status of quality of gur (jaggery) production in the ghulaaries, on Wednesday directed the state Food Safety Department to ensure jaggery’s quality production in the State.

It was observed that few of the units, especially run by migrant labourers, are indulging in the unscrupulous practice of using unapproved chemicals for making gur, said the Minister.

The State’s Food and Drug Administration commissioner Kahan Singh Pannu informed the Minister that there are 617 ghulaaries in Punjab, which are engaged in processing of sugarcane to make gur and jaggery. These are small scale units normally functioning along the major roads, he said.

Pannu said all the unit owners have been provided one day training regarding good practices of making jaggery by Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana. It was also informed that a large number of ghulaaries in Punjab are producing good quality gur or jaggery which is even exported to other countries.

Sidhu asked the FDA Commissioner to conduct a thorough sampling of jaggery producing units.

He further asked the Commissioner to act strictly, including the closure of jaggery units, which are indulging in wrong practices which are harmful for human health.

The Minister directed that joint teams of officers of departments of Agriculture and Health should be constituted to complete the process of inspections of all the units in a period of 15 days.

In December, the jaggery processing tips were imparted to all the stakeholders under the Tandrust Punjab Mission.

Pannu, who is also the Tandrust Punjab Mission director, said that a similar exercise was conducted during the previous year as well wherein about 600 people were imparted training on ‘Sugarcane Juice Processing to Safe Jaggery’ by PAU.

During this season, nearly 200 people have been trained with the primary focus on enhancing the quality and hygiene of the produce, besides teaching them about chemical-free or organic formulation of jaggery.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/food-safety-dept-asked-to-ensure-jaggery---s-quality-production.html

72,06-2-20,BJYM to send dummy smartphones to Punjab CM,"To remind the Congress Government of all the promises made with the voters of Punjab, the Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM) has decided to send dummy smartphones to the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.

The saffron party’s youth wing conducted a meeting at Ludhiana on Wednesday to condemn the Chief Minister for making fake promises with the youngsters.

BJYM’s Ludhiana district president Mahesh Sharma, after the meeting, declared that they would send dummy smartphone to the Chief Minister with a letter to remind all the promises he made with the voters before 2017 elections.

The youth wing maintained that the Chief Minister had announced to distribute smartphones to the youngsters on January 26, but not even a single person received the phone. “Almost three years are gone since the Congress Government came into power and the party leaders made tall promises with voters, especially youth who were promised smart phones,” said Sharma.

Sharma said that in September 2019, the State Cabinet had approved proposal to distribute smartphones among youngsters, and then on December 2, 2019, the Chief Minister also announced on Twitter that 1.06 lakh smart phones will be distributed among students of Class XI and XII on January 26, 2020.

“Not even a single student got that phone in Mohali where Capt Amarinder unfurled the national flag on Republic

Day. Now, we will gift dummy smart phone to the Chief Minister,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjym-to-send-dummy-smartphones-to-punjab-cm.html
73,06-2-20,"Kejriwal has fulfilled tall promises, will retain Delhi","Very interestingly, one gets to see big billboards across the national capital region displaying the slogan ‘Desh maange Narendra Modi, Dilli maange Kejriwal' meaning the country wants Modi; Delhi wants Kejriwal. One Deepak Madan, who identifies himself as a volunteer of the RSS, has organised these hoardings that have left both BJP and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders scratching their heads in utter confusion. Madan says publicly that Modi is a great leader fit to lead India; but Kejriwal is the tallest one for Delhi.

Arvind Kejriwal had promised very affordable or free water and electricity in his first election manifesto, at which the whole country had laughed. But he did it and stunned the world. Lately, he has announced free power up to 200 units every month to benefit 3.2 million residents. The existing 50% electricity subsidy for the 201-400 units range will continue. Any Delhi consumer availing up to 200 units of electricity will get a zero-electricity bill. Consumers of 201-400 units will receive approximately 50% subsidy. Incredible indeed!

Incidentally, 200 units cost ?1,400 in Mumbai, ?910 in Gurugram and ?1,310 in Noida while in Delhi it is free. The Delhi electricity tariff has also not changed in the last five years. Similarly, there will be no ‘Development and Infrastructure' charges for water and sewer services anymore. Citizens will only have to pay Rs 2,310 for a new water or sewer connection.

Immediately after coming to power in 2015, Kejriwal had announced a 50% subsidy on monthly power consumption of up to 400 units and 20,000 litres of free water per month for all households. At that time, the scheme cost the exchequer around ?1,670 crore annually. Kejriwal managed this tough task mainly by controlling pilferage and theft by consumers in connivance with corrupt officials.

“I am supporting Kejriwal because I have seen the work he has done for Delhi. He has improved the healthcare system so much… I run an ambulance service in Paschim Vihar and keep taking people to hospitals. I have seen the kind of facilities that hospitals now offer,” says the ‘hording guy' Madan. “Education system in Delhi has improved significantly in the five years of AAP’s rule. Government schools are a lot better now. Teachers are extremely sincere and keep motivating students to put in hard work.” Madan is preparing to have more hoardings across Delhi.

“I feel that to become a developed country, we don’t need 50 years. Just ‘10 years' is enough. One only needs the right vision and intent,” Kejriwal had said at the recent ‘Hindustan Times Leadership Summit'.

Unfortunately, the BJP has no Chief Ministerial face to put up for Delhi. They are still trying in vain to project Modi as the saviour for Delhi, which the local voters dismiss laughingly. The Delhi BJP unit regularised 1,731 unauthorised colonies. Manoj Tiwari, Vijay Goel, and Vijendra Gupta continue to project it as a great achievement. But Delhi voters are not impressed at all. They want to know if the BJP-ruled States have made water and electricity free or cheap.

Promise fulfilling and accountability are being effectively marketed by the AAP. ‘Mohalla clinics', Government schools having turned as attractive as elite class private schools and capping expensive private school fees tightly for long have made Kejriwal immensely adorable.

Further, Kejriwal's promise to clean up the toxic Yamuna river in next five years is going well with the voters while the BJP is banking on its promise of nationwide NRC, not really making clear how Delhiites will benefit from it.

Kejriwal launched ‘India against Corruption' campaign in 2011. Anna Hazare was brought in to the anti-corruption fold as a credible face to be discarded within two years. The AAP was formed in 2012 with zero political legacy, vote banks, dynasties or even an ideology. The India against Corruption movement was a massive hit. Kejriwal sloganeered that all political parties and leaders were mostly thieves. Kejriwal’s genius in political entrepreneurship lay in the subtle manner he capitalised his fan following. A ruthless ‘use-and-discard’ approach for friend and foe, a redefinition of ‘welfarism' wrapped in nationalism symbolised through the ‘Bharat Mata ki jai' slogan and rampant display of Bhagat Singh’s portraits, all this became the USP for his political ventures.

The AAP has had its own ‘home jolts' too. A few founder-members and key functionaries including Ministers had to be xpelled on charges ranging from corruption to filming themselves having extramarital activities. Star figures like Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan had to be shown the door on incompatibility grounds. Kejriwal has not been lax on his basic stand on principles of integrity and austerity. He has been dictatorial too when it came to taking critical decisions. Whoever failed to agree to his strategies had to go. The AAP has developed its own version of non-ideological, underclass welfarism. The positive change and success brought in by the AAP are being acknowledged even by Kejriwal’s bitterest critics.

Unlike Rahul Gandhi, Kejriwal has kept intact his under-stated, soft Hindu identity. He never endorsed the intellectual Left’s demands for secular purity. He is politically wise and practical. So, he has launched a free pilgrimage programme for senior citizens for popular destinations like Ajmer Sharif and all big Hindu and Sikh shrines. The media has been persuaded to believe that Kejriwal is a modern-day ‘Shravan Kumar', the legendary parents-loving son who took his ageing parents to all 84 centres of Hindu pilgrimage on his shoulders. Pragmatic Kejriwal was also quick to host the ‘TM Krishna Concert' when forces of the rightwing Hindus opposed it vehemently. Similarly, he organised a huge, community ‘Diwali Mela' with big fanfare strictly without firecrackers. This IITian, former bureaucrat has proved to be smarter and nobler than most career politicians crowding out everywhere. Kejriwal-AAP is now an established brand with uniquely flexible political decisions and moves. Seasoned political analysts and critics do agree to the fact that Kejriwal may soon turn the torchbearer for best political reforms in India.

The bottom-line: Modern-day, techno-savvy bureaucrats learn nation-building techniques faster than ordinary self-serving politicians. Modi became a ‘larger than life' icon with exhaustive tutoring, mentoring and marketing support from super brains at astronomical costs. Kejriwal is all by himself because he has robust commonsense. He knows exactly what is critically required for the common man and how all that can be organised without depleting the public exchequer disproportionately.

All surveys show team-Modi is just no match for Kejriwal, who made extremely tall promises and kept them within months of coming to power. Modi would take at least two terms to achieve half of that, only hopefully.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kejriwal-has-fulfilled-tall-promises--will-retain-delhi.html

77,06-2-20,Haryana Jail Minister: Dera chief faces many threats,"According to Haryana Jails Minister Ranjit Singh Chautala, jailed Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh faces many threats internationally and has been provided heightened security due to this.

He was justifying the heavily guarded prisoner’s absence at an event inside Sunaria Jail in Rohtak on Tuesday where over 300 inmates were present.

The Minister on Wednesday clarified that he had inadvertently made a reference to the Shiromani Akali Dal while talking about some other outfits from which the sect head faced threat.

Chautala made the remarks at an event on organic farming organised for inmates on Tuesday during which he, along with Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat, addressed the prisoners.

Talking to The Pioneer Chautala said, “Some SAD leaders met me today and registered their complaints on this issue. I told them that it was my slip of tongue to name the Akali Dal during press meet. My intention was not to hurt any political party.”

Chautala said that it is well-know to all that since long Dera chief has been facing life threat. He earlier used to travel in the State with the fleet of 200 vehicles. Former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda had also given him facility of jammer and four police vehicles which used to be included in his fleet during his travel in the state when he was out of jail.

The 52-year-old sect head is currently lodged in high-security Sunaria Jail in Rohtak, where he is already serving a 20-year sentence for raping two of his followers.

Chautala said that in jail, Ram Rahim has been kept in separate barrack with adequate security arrangements. He does not meet with other inmates.

Chauala said, “We have not invited him in the programme due to security reasons. We would be needing clearance from Union Home Minister as all these things are in the notice of the Home Ministry. Therefore, we cannot take any decision alone (on asking him to take part in events with other prisoners.”

However, when controversy erupted over Chautala’s reference to the Akali Dal, he he sought to clarify his remark.

“I want to clarify the thing. The Gujarat Governor had to visit the prison and speak to prisoners about organic farming. I was also present with him and spoke during the event. As many as 300 inmates were present. When I came out, I was asked by media persons if Ram Rahim was also present during the event, to which I said he was not asked to attend the programme due to security reasons,” he said.

“I said he faces threat to his life. While I was mentioning Babbar Khalsa, I meant to give reference to that outfit only and not Akali Dal. Taking Akali Dal’s name was just a slip of tongue,” Chautala reiterated.

Jails Minister also said that he has decided to train over 20,000 inmates in state’s 19 jails in the zero-budget natural farming. When Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was asked by reporters about his Minister pointing out threats to life of the Dera chief, he said, “Our police and intelligence keep an eye on who faces threat from whom. If anyone faces any kind of danger or threat, he/she will get full security.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana-jail-minister--dera-chief-faces-many-threats.html

79,06-2-20,Sundari translocation to MP remains in limbo,"The fate of tigress ‘Sundari’ seems to be uncertain as the process to send her back to Madhya Pradesh from Odisha has been put on hold for an indefinite period.

Sundari at present would not be relocated to the Kanha Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh as this wildlife habitat has two more tigers, informed Odisha Chief Wildlife Warden (CWW) Hari Shankar Upadhyay here on Wednesday.

The tigress would be shifted to Madhya Pradesh only after relocation of the two tigers to another wildlife sanctuary, he said.

Currently, Sundari has been kept at an enclosure at the Satkosia Tiger Reserve in Angul district. She was brought from the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh in 2018 under a tiger translocation project approved by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) for tiger augmentation and management at Satkosia.

However, the authorities were forced to keep the tigress inside an enclosure following its repeated straying into human habitations at Satkosia and allegedly killing two persons at villages inside the tiger reserve.

Apart from that, ‘poaching’ of the first trans-located tiger ‘Kanha’ from Madhya Pradesh had triggered a debate on the translocation project.

In view of the Odisha Government’s lack of initiatives for protecting two tigers trans-located from Madhya Pradesh as part of the tiger reintroduction programme at the Satkosia Tiger Reserve, the NTCA decided to relocate Sundari from Satkosia to the Kanha Tiger Reserve after suspending the tiger translocation programme.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sundari-translocation--to-mp-remains-in-limbo.html
80,06-2-20,3-day Joranda Mahima Mela from tomorrow,"The world famous Mahima mela will be celebrated at Joranda from February 7 for three days at Joranda, 26 km from Dhenkanal headquarters town.

Mahima saints deployed at 58 ashrams in Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhatishgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Andhar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Nepal, Bangladesh and Japan were coming to the main shrine at Joranda with their annual collections in order to meet the huge expenditure to be incurred during the festival.

They were accommodated at Talamula Mutt, Natima Mutt, Lata Ashram, Patna Mutt and Jamudara Mutt. Expecting arrival of at least three lakh devotees during the occasion, the district administration of Dhenkanal had taken all precautionary measures for uninterrupted power supply, water supply and also provision of sanitation in and around the mela ground. Apart from deployment of adequate police forces, a bomb detection squad and cops in plain dress would also be engaged in order to prevent any untoward incidents. Hotels, make-shift shops and other business establishments had already erected temporary sheds by acquiring grounds near the temple premises. Besides, in order to avoid stampeding, temporary barricades had been constructed at the entrance site, north and west door of the Gadimindir. Reportedly, the east and south doors of the Gadimindir were to be used for the exit of devotees. Moreover, to avert rush of vehicles, one-way traffic arrangement had been made during the occasion.

Sources said , the Mahima cult emerged from village Jaka in Dhenkanal district during the year 1874, with the objectives of protesting Bramhins and Jamindars who stood for idolatry, casteism and untouchability. Mahima cult started to preach for promotion of classless society. The Mahima followers believed in shapeless god “Sunya Bramha”. Instead of using any hymns, the Mahima saints, only did prayers by reciting “Mahima Allekh”. Mahima Gosain, the propounder of Mahima cult, with his desciple Bhima Bhoi, ultimately had selected Joranda as his main abode and started the Mahima Mela there in year 1975, by igniting the Akhanda Dhuni(uninterrupted fire) on Magha Purnami for the welfare of universe.

On the instruction of Mahima Gosain, his desciples kept the fire buring and organising the mela, every year till Guru Purnima, even after the total annihilation (Maha Nirvana)of Mahima Gosain in year 1976.

Sources said Mahima Swami was first seen at Puri Danda known as Dhulia Baba. Later, he was found in deep meditation standing on one leg at Khandagiri for several years surviving only by air (Bayu).",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/3-day-joranda-mahima-mela-from-tomorrow.html

""The moment I reached there they were talking to me till the organisers came till they wanted to know who had sent me there. This means that they are verifying everyone who is coming to the protest through the people who have sent them,"" said Kapoor.

""They ransacked my bag and stole my Aadhar Card, and my phone. It is ironical that those who are protesting to reveal their documents want us journalists to reveal our identity to show the reality of this sponsored attempt to break the integrity of India,"" she alleged.

Addressing a rally in east Delhi's Kondli ahead of the February 8 Assembly polls, Gandhi said it was the Congress's 15-year tenure (1998-2013) in the national capital that gave the city its modern infrastructure such as the metro service.

""The politics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal revolves around hatred. The only funda (strategy) of Modi and Kejriwal is to divide people,"" he said. At another rally in Chandni Chowk, Gandhi said the biggest fear of the youth today is unemployment.

""He (Modi) takes advantage of that fear. He does not want the youth to get employment because that acts as oxygen for his politics,"" Gandhi said. Taking a dig at the BJP, he said patriotism was to fight with the British and make India prosperous through white revolution, green revolution, information and technology revolution.

""Now, the real patriotism is to provide employment to the youth and I will fulfill it,"" the Congress leader said. Slamming Home Minister Amit Shah, he exhorted the people not to listen to his speech as its nothing but ""trash"". He also said the speeches of Modi and Kejriwal were nothing but ""lies"".

Recalling the Congress rule under Sheila Dikshit, he said the late three-time chief minister never complained or gave excuses as Kejriwal.

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra hit out at BJP leaders on Wednesday, saying their character can be defined by the kind of slogans they raise. She accused the Aam Aadmi Party of ""modelling"" on former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit's development model.

""Their slogans tell their character. Ye desh jodne wale nare hain? (Are these slogans in favour of bringing the country together),"" Gandhi said at a poll rally in Chandni Chowk.

""No one can get freedom in this country without Hindu-Muslim unity. If there was no unity among religions, Britishers would still have been here. The country cannot progress with their policies, they want to divide people and do not address the real issues,"" the Congress general secretary said.

Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of being ""hungry for publicity"", Gandhi sought explanation from them over their expenditure on advertisements.

""Sheila Dikshit developed Delhi to what it is today. Metro, flyovers, all these were developed by her and then they came and started modelling on her development model,"" Gandhi said as she unveiled a report card of the AAP Government, drawing comparisons with the Congress regime.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/only-strategy-of-modi--kejriwal-is-to-divide-people--rahul.html
98,06-2-20,Women voters floor AAP’s Chadha with marriage offers,"The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) Rajinder Nagar candidate, Raghav Chadha, is getting a lot of attention of late, not because of the imminent Assembly polls here. The 31-year-old chartered accountant, a bachelor, seems to be so popular with women voters that he has been inundated with marriage proposals from many of them.

Chadha has received at least 12 marriage proposals on social media in the last 15 days, according to his social media team.

""Recently, a woman tagged him on Twitter, asking him to marry her. Chadha said the economy was not doing good so it was not the right time to get married,"" his social media manager said.

Chadha's Instagram account is also replete with messages from his women fans, he said. ""Women from across the country have expressed their interest in him. We usually don't respond to such messages. If the women are from Delhi, we ask them to vote for him,"" he said.

Lean and fair-skinned, the bespectacled young politician fits well into the conventional north Indian standards for a good looking man.

Though Chadha is not new to this kind of attention, the number of such proposals have surged because his social media activity has increased due to the elections, the social media manager said.

""When he went to a school for a meeting recently, a teacher said 'If I had a daughter, I would have got her married to you',"" another member of his team recalled.

Chadha doesn't really like to talk about the proposals and is a bit shy, a woman member of the team said.

The AAP's face on prime-time TV debates, Chadha is contesting his first assembly election.

He had last year unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha election from South Delhi.

105,06-2-20,BJP MPs raise ‘Chaibasa massacre’ in Parliament,"BJP parliamentarians from State on Wednesday staged a dharna near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi at Parliament House protesting against the killings of seven tribals by ‘Pro Pathalgadi’ supporters at Burugulikera village of Chaibasa last month. The MPs, which included members from both the houses, staged a protest with posters in their hands saying, ‘Killers of tribals--Rahul and Hemant Government’.

The MPs on dharna claimed that due to State Government’s soft approach towards Pro Pathalgadi supporters such type of incidents have escalated in State. The MPs blamed the Soren government for dropping sedition cases against Pro Pathalgadi supporters. It may be noted that Hemant Soren in its first Cabinet decision decided to lift sedition cases against tribals involved in Pathalgadi and CNT/SPT violence.

Days after State Government’s Cabinet decision seven tribal people were beheaded allegedly by Pathalgarhi supporters on January 19.

The BJP MPs not only staged a peaceful dharna against State government’s failure to check such type of incidents, but the BJP MP from Godda Nishikant Dubey also raised the issue in the House. Raising the issue in Lok Sabha, Dubey said, “Incidents such as Pathalgadi the supporters of whom are against the Constitution and Democracy have escalated in State ever since JMM Congress Government came to power. The Pro Pathalgadi supporters are involved in all type of illegal activities such as

opium cultivation and other illegal activities are neither following the Constitution nor the law of State.”

Dubey blamed the Soren government for being mute spectator on the alleged illegal activities of Pro Pathalgadi supporters. The Godda MP said, “Seven innocent tribals were killed by Pathalgadi supporters but the Congress party not even bothered to send any delegation to the incident site.”

Echoing the views of Dubey, AJSU party MP from Giridih Chandra Prakash Choudhary, who too was at dharna wrote a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah demanding a high level probe in the incident. Choudhary through his letter stated that the high level probe under the supervision of Central agencies will bring the truth of the incident also it will repose faith on people about law and order. Choudhary in his letter also highlighted the Communal tension in Lohardaga and Giridih where Pro CAA supporters were attacked by anti social element last month.

Earlier, last month the six member team of BJP probing into Burugulikera massacre of West Singhbhum has submitted its report to party national president JP Nadda.

In the report, the BJP leaders accused State government of conducting a ‘biased’ probe into the killings.

Talking to The Pioneer, the District Programme Officer (DPO) Akhilesh Mishra said, “Anganwadi workers have just suspended their protest so it is not possible to distribute THR so soon as it takes one week to ten days to send the ration to each Anganwadi centre. Only those workers who were not part of the protest have probably distributed THR in their respective centres.”

Regarding the joining of the protesting Anganwadi workers who were served termination letters by the department few days back, Mishra said, “When those Anganwadi workers will cite the reason of their absence with the application of returning back to their work, only after that the procedure of reinstating them will begin.

Wuhan, over 1,000 km from Chinese capital of Beijing and more than 800 km from the top class metropolis Shanghai, is a historic city and played a key role in the 20th century history of China.

“I am very happy about the medical education system at Wuhan university. They offer quality education at affordable fees,” a student who had returned from Wuhan last month, said here.

Aiswarya Hariharan, a third year MBBS student, returned to India early January soon after the school was shut for vacation.

According to her, the Wuhan University School of Medicine has become a centre of attraction for MBBS aspirants from Kerala because of its international standard.

Overseas students prefer the university as the six-year- long course is offered in English for them.

“In our batch, there are about 70 international students. Interestingly, 50 of them are from Kerala,” said Aiswarya from Tripunithura near here. Parent of another MBBS student studying in Wuhan said he sent his daughter there because of its high standard of education in a fees affordable for him.

“I spent Rs 5 to 6 lakhs for fee, accommodation and food annually for my daughter. This fee amount is very less when compared with many of the self-financing medical institutes with least facilities in India.” “Besides, studying overseas is beneficial for the students as they get an international exposure,” the parent said.

Revathy Krishnan from Thiruvananthapuram is also doing MBBS in Wuhan. The third year student said she was very happy about her institute and its faculty which offer medical education at par with any other reputed Indian medical institute.

The students claimed that the facilities the institute offer at Wuhan university, which is also recognised by the Government of India, is of international standard.

The students said around 500 from Kerala are pursuing MBBS course at Wuhan University School of Medicine.

However, a government department set up to redress the grievances of Non-Resident Keralites (NRKs) said there was no exact data on this number. Vice Chairman of the Non Resident Keralites Affairs (NORKA Roots) K Varadarajan said no records of the Keralite students studying in Chinese institutions were available with the state.

“We believe that most of the Keralite students studying in Wuhan have returned to Kerala following the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus. But some of the students, whose courses will complete in coming months, are still staying back there,” he said.

“There is no possibility to get the exact number of Keralite students studying in universities in Wuhan and other Chinese provinces. It is because of the virus scare, we came to know such a sizable number of students are studying in Chinese universities”, Varadarajan told PTI.

Meanwhile, the students expressed confidence China would very soon overcome the coronavirus crisis and that they would be able to continue their education in Wuhan.

According to students, though there are about 35 medical colleges in Kerala not all of them could aspire to get a seat in one of them. Educational consultant, Jacob George, General Manager of the Asian Educational Consultancy, however, felt the number of students who go to China for MBBS were minimal as several others preferred countries like Russia.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/wuhan-famous-hub-for-medical-aspirants-from-kerala.html

120,06-2-20,State to frame rules for regularising para teachers,"State School Education and Literacy Minister Jagarnath Mahato on Wednesday met representatives of the 65,000 odd para teachers in Jharkhand and assured to come up with proper rules for regularisation of their services. The Minister also said that the Government will consider withdrawing the cases leveled against protesting para teachers during the former Raghubar Das-led Government.

“We will certainly come up with rules and regulations for regularisation of services for para teachers. The current rules will also be scrutinised,” said Mahato.

The para teachers, ad hoc teachers appointed under the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) programme of the Centre back in 2002, impart education to students in rural and semi-urban areas of the tribal state. Some of the schools, hardly a few kilometer from the State capital’s periphery are run by para teachers alone.

Last year, the teachers had to suffer due to delay in disbursement of their honorariums. The Government had then said that the SSA was not disbursing enough funds to pay honorariums to all the para teachers in Jharkhand. The teachers have also been up in arms against the Government demanding regularisation of services. Almost every year, the teachers have staged protests and gone of strikes, crippling the primary education system in rural Jharkhand in the past decade or so.

The latest in the series of protests by these ad hoc teachers was a strike from November 16, 2018 to January 17, 2019. Para teachers Suryadev Thakur and Ujjwal Rai reportedly died after being lathi-charged at a Chief Minister’s event on November 15, Jharkhand’s Statehood Day. Another para teacher, Kanchan Das, allegedly died of cold while protesting outside former minister Louis Marandi’s residence in Dumka in course of the strike.

Sanjay Dubey, a para teacher who met Mahato on Wednesday, said that around 10,000 para teachers are still serving as ad hoc teachers in the State despite clearing the Jharkhand Teachers Eligibility Test (JTET).

He requested the Minister to ensure regularisation of services for the teachers who have cleared JTET. “We have handed over a list of our demands to the minister. We are hopeful of getting his support,” said Dubey.

Mahato also said that his Ministry will gradually address all the issues pending due to the alleged lackadaisical approach of the former Government. “There are many issues that need our attention. We will gradually address all of them,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-to-frame-rules-for-regularising-para-teachers.html

123,06-2-20,City girl becomes first Santhali interpreter in Parliament,"With the Central Government taking steps to promote regional languages so that members of both the houses can speak in the mother tongues in the Parliament, the demand for language experts and interpreters is on the rise. Ranchi girl 29- year old Prity Priya Marandi is the first person to be associated with the Rajya Sabha Secretariat as a Santhali interpreter.

“I came to know about this job through a news channel. Initially I was selected as a language expert and started translating speeches. Few months later, I was trained for a month on live interpreting. Currently I do both as and when the Secretariat requires,” said Prity.

In December 2019, Prity got an opportunity to translate for a member of the Rajya Sabha- Sarojini Hembram, from Santhali to Hindi

“When I got a chance to work with the Rajya Sabha, there was a concern for my language since Santhali is a major tribal language and it should be known not just in Jharkhand but across the country. I felt that when the government is keen to promote it then I too should be a part of it,” added the interpreter.

Marandi is of the opinion that language and culture are the main factors that keep a society alive and dynamic.

“This is applicable for all the tribal languages of Jharkhand. I believe that constitutional recognition and political encouragement will go a long way in spreading a language,” remarked Prity.

The language expert strongly feels that the government should take initiatives to educate in regional languages as well.

“Because I am a student and a research scholar in Hindi literature, I know how important a language is. Jharkhand has more than 30 tribal languages. When a tribal child steps into school, he or she does not understand Hindi which needs to dealt with. The State should take steps regarding the introduction of regional languages in schools and colleges,” believes Prity.

Born in Tinpahar in the district of Sahebganj, Jharkhand, Prity completed her schooling from St Teresa’s School in Dumka. She is a gold medalist in Hindi honours from St Xavier’s College, Ranchi and is a post graduate in Hindi literature from Jawaharlal Nehru University. Presently she is pursuing her M.Phil on the topic ‘Aadiwasi patrika mein abhivyakt aadiwasi samaaj aur sanskriti’ from JNU.

“Whatever I have achieved is because of the immense support from my parents and siblings. They are my backbone and today they are very proud of my achievements,” added Priya.

124,06-2-20,Groom comes home from China for wedding; rituals postponed,"A groom, who arrived in Kerala from China for his wedding two weeks ago, had to postpone the ceremony on the insistence of health authorities as the youth is presently under home quarantine for the novel Corona virus.

The marriage had been scheduled for Tuesday at Kadangode grama panchayat here.

Panchayat sources said they came to hear about the proposed ceremony only a day before the wedding.

“We came to know about the wedding on February 3. The health inspector immediately contacted the District Medical Officer (DMO) and we sent a letter to Deputy Director. Following the intervention of the officials, the family postponed the wedding”, the sources said. The youth, who is working as an accountant in Yiwu, about 1500 km from Wuhan, had reached Kochi airport on January 19.

The groom was told by the health authorities that he cannot get married as part of the health protocol of the Government, which stipulates that those returning from China have to strictly report to the health authorities and quarantine themselves for a 28-day period at home, the sources said.

A local health official said a reception was held in the evening, in which the groom did not participate.

The bride was garlanded by the groom’s mother and brought to the hall before the guests and a traditional “Sadya” was arranged for the guests.

Two Medical students, a businessman and a man working in China were among those from the panchayat who had recently returned to the state, the panchayat sources said.

The LDF Government had asked families of those who return from the virus affected regions to postpone marriages to prevent a possible outbreak of the disease in the State.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/groom-comes-home-from-china-for-wedding--rituals-postponed.html
125,06-2-20,Act not meant for removal of people from India: Uddhav,"Adding to continued confusion over the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government’s stand on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Shiv Sena president and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday called for removal of ‘misunderstanding’ in the minds of the people about the CAA which, he said, was not meant for throwing Indian citizens out of the country.

Taking a stand on CAA that is contrary to the one taken by his party’s ruling alliance partners in the State — NCP and Congress which have opposed the amended citizenship law in no uncertain terms, Uddhav however appeared to be on the same page as his allies on the issue of the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). “We will not allow NRC in the state as it would impact people of all religions,” he said.

Choosing not to oppose CAA, the Chief Minister said that there was a “lot of misunderstanding” about CAA which “should be removed” from the minds of people.

“CAA is not a law meant for removing anyone from the country. Amit Shah has said that CAA is meant a law for giving citizenship to people. I accept the law to that extent. It is law meant for giving citizenship to the persecuted people coming from the neighbouring countries. It is not meant for throwing out people from the country,” Uddhav said, in the third and concluding part of an interview published ijn his party’s official mouth-peace “Saamana”.

“In our neighbouring countries, persecuted minorities are Hindus. This is because Pakistan and Bangladesh are Muslim countries. Given that they are being persecuted in these countries, they want to come to India. We do not know the exact number of persecuted Hindus who want to come to India from these countries,” he said.

Uddhav, however, posed some questions to the Modi Government. “But, we would like to know from the Modi government if it has made residential accommodation for the persecuted Hindus coming to India. Will the Government give houses to them under the Prime Minister Awas Yojana? Will you provide employment to them? What kind of arrangements that the government has made to provide education to the children of persecuted Hindus coming to India?. We have a right to know this Government,” the Chief Minister said.

Alluding to the NRC, Uddhav said: “What is not going to be discussed or what is not being discussed is the proposed NRC. NRC will not impact just Muslims in the country, but will also affect people from all religions in the country. We will not allow NRC in the State,” the chief minister said.

“Under NRC, all people will have to prove their citizenship. There would not be any difference between Hindus and Muslims when it comes proving citizenship. Muslims have taken to street in protest against NRC. What if Hindus take to streets against NRC. Take the case of Assam, 19 lakh people could not prove their citizenship. Of the 19 lakh people, 14 lakh people are Hindus. Among those who failed to prove their citizenship were family members of MLAs and MPs,” he said.

Uddhav, however, reiterated that the Shiv Sena was all for the deportation of illegal Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigrants to their respective countries. “There has not been any change in our stand on this issue. In the past, late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray had strongly advocated the need for throwing out all illegal immigrants Pakistan and Bangladesh to their respective countries. Uddhav’s comments on CAA should be seen in the context of the fact that the NCP and Congress, the two constituents in the MVA government, have been pressing him to pass a resolution in the Maharashtra Assembly against CAA. If Uddhav’s remarks are anything to go by, the Shiv Sena is not ready to go with its two ruling alliance partners.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/act-not-meant-for-removal-of-people-from-india--uddhav.html

128,06-2-20,Bravery award winner writes to CJI about children at protests,"Days after the death of an infant at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh protest, National Bravery Award winner Zen Sadavarte wrote to the Chief Justice of India seeking directives to prevent children from participating in protests.

Four-month-old Mohammed Jahaan died during the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi on January 30.

In a letter released to media outlets, the Class 7 student claimed that the incident was a violation of the deceased infant's right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.

Inclusion of children and infants in protests amounts to torture and cruelty, Zen stated in her petition.

The police had failed to take cognisance of the involvement of children in protests, she said, and appealed to the Apex Court to direct authorities to stop such involvement.

The 12-year-old argued that organisers of the Shaheen Bagh protest and parents of the infant had failed to protect his rights.

Quoting a newspaper article in her petition, Zen pointed out that the infant's death certificate did not mention the cause of death and demanded a post-mortem to ascertain the same.

Zen had received a National Bravery Award in 2019, for guiding 17 people to safety when a fire broke out at Parel's Crystal Tower.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bravery-award-winner-writes-to-cji-about-children-at-protests.html

131,06-2-20,Legal eagles to debate state of law at Difficult Dialogues,"At a time when a debate is raging on the legal and Constitutional validity of the Citizenship Amendment Act the fifth edition of the Difficult Dialogues will be held in Goa from February 14 for a brainstorming on the state of law in India. Top legal eagles from India and abroad as well as members of the civil society, media, NGOs will take part in the three-day annual event.

The objective of Difficult Dialogues 2020 would be to bridge the gap between policy formulation and the on-ground implementation of the law. At the end of the seminar, based on the suggestion made by the speakers a set of recommendation will be submitted to the Central government for helping in policy formulation.

Difficult Dialogues was instituted by philanthropist Surina Narula in 2016. Over the last five years, it has partnered with several reputed international knowledge partners like the London School of Economics & Political Science (LSE), University College London (UCL) and the University of Oxford, UK to have constructive debates and come up with strategic recommendations for various key themes relevant to India and the region. These include themes like Global Finance and Civil Society in 2016, India's Health in 2017, Gender Equality in 2018, Education For All in 2019, and the State of Law this year. During this journey, the International Centre Goa (ICG) and the Goa University have been long term Indian knowledge partners.

Commenting on Difficult Dialogues , Surina Narula, the founder of Difficult Dialogues said, “My experience working with NGOs spanning 20 years has given me a deep understanding of the pressing need to work on policy change. 'Difficult Dialogues' is an endeavor to provide a common platform to bridge this gap between policy makers and civil society involved with implementation. Unless the last mile implementers are included in the conversation, policies will only reflect what mega rich businesses want and democracy will be diluted. This year the task is to explore the State of Law in the country as the judiciary and the legal framework is an important part of a diverse nation like India for providing justice, equality and prosperity to all its citizens.”

This year the Knowledge Partners for Difficult Dialogues include the Centre for Socio-Legal Studies, University of Oxford, (CSLS, Oxford), Bar Association of India (BAI), O P Jindal Global University, Centre for the Study of Law and Governance, Jawaharlal Nehru University (CSLG, JNU), the Goa University (GU), and the International Centre Goa (ICG).

132,06-2-20,Man in Surat hospital for suspected infection slips away,"A 41-year-old man quarantined on Tuesday for suspected novel coronavirus infection walked out of the civil hospital here in Gujarat without giving his blood samples for testing, a senior official said on Wednesday.

However, after the hospital authorities informed district administration and the police about the incident, the man’s family members on Wednesday said he would return to the hospital to give his blood samples.

A senior hospital official said that the 41-year-old walked out of the facility without informing anybody, as he was “scared”, apparently of contracting the infection.

The man had returned from China on January 19.

Meanwhile, samples of three of the total five cases of suspected nCoV infection in Gujarat have tested negative while result of two others is awaited.

All these persons had returned from China--the country from where the nCoV infection originated--in the recent past.

“A man was admitted in the isolation ward of the hospital for suspected nCoV on Tuesday afternoon. However, before we could collect his blood samples, he slipped away. We have informed the district collector and the police,” said Priti Kapadia, in-charge medical superintendent of the hospital.

She said a family member of the man met with the hospital authorities on Wednesday and assured them that he would get himself admitted to the hospital again for giving his blood sample.

“If he cooperates and provides his blood samples, we shall be able to prevent the spread of the virus in case his samples test positive,” Kapadia said.

Hospital Resident Medical Officer (RMO) Ketan Naik said the man walked out of the hospital without informing anybody despite counselling on Tuesday.

A Health department official said they are following up with 622 of the total 769 passengers who had returned from China in the recent past.

In Ahmedabad, we have followed up with 195 people, followed by Mehsana (70), Banaskantha (62), and Rajkot (47), he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/man-in-surat-hospital-for-suspected-infection-slips-away.html
133,06-2-20,Kerala tackling virus with experience drawn from fighting Nipah,"Faced with the challenges posed by the novel Coronavirus (nCoV), the Kerala Government is banking on its experience gleaned from fighting the deadly Nipah outbreak in 2018 and 2019 to effectively tackle the current situation.

Activating its officials, doctors and field staff to face the challenge much before the State’s first Coronavirus case was reported from Thrissur last week, the state health department has put all persons who have returned from nCoV-hit China under its surveillance since January 15.

“If you are a person with travel history to China and returned from that country after January 15, you will be put under the radar of the district surveillance team,” Dr S Sreedevi, additional DMO Ernakulam and district surveillance officer, told PTI.

According to her, those who returned from the coronavirus-hit regions are given instructions through phone on the need to remain in home quarantine for 28 days for the safety of his/her family members. Details of the people who have travel history to China are taken from the airports.

Information about the home quarantined persons are updated to the district health officials by the field staff.

“If that person is found not following the guidelines for coronavirus, he will get a call from the top district medical officers urging him not to mingle with anyone,” the medical officer said.

According to her, in most cases the people obey the instructions of the health officials as they are aware of the threat posed by the disease.

“Our experience in tackling the Nipah virus in 2018 and 2019 help us in dealing with the nCoV cases,” the medical officer said.

The Kerala Government declared novel coronavirus as a “state specific disaster” on Monday as three students who returned from China’s Wuhan province, epicentre of the epidemic, tested positive for the infection in the last few days.

The State Health Minister KK Shailaja has said the state health department is ready to face the novel coronavirus challenge drawing on its experience in overcoming the Nipah virus outbreak in 2018 and 2019.

In line with the steps taken to tackle the Nipah virus outbreak, a state control room in Thiruvananthapuram and district control rooms at all district headquarters were set up much before the first coronavirus case was reported.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kerala-tackling-virus-with-experience-drawn-from-fighting-nipah.html
134,06-2-20,Suspense over Ministerial berths ahead of K’taka Cabinet expansion,"Reflecting the mood ahead of the Cabinet expansion on Thursday, Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Wednesday put the ball in the BJP high command’s court regarding the number of Ministers to be inducted.

“It is only after the evening things will be clear when we get information from Delhi (BJP central leadership),” he told reporters in the district headquarters town of Kalaburagi.

He was replying to a query by reporters who wished to know whether 13 aspirants, including ten who defected from Congress-JD(S), helped BJP bring down the HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition Government and won the bypolls on the ruling party ticket in December, would be inducted into the cabinet.

The Chief Minister, however, asserted the swearing-in ceremony would take place on Thursday at 10.30 a.M at the Raj Bhavan.

Briefing reporters on Sunday, Yediyurappa had said ‘10 plus three’ will take oath on February 6, apparently referring to the induction of only 10 out of 11 (who defected to BJP from Congress-JD(S)) winners of the by-polls.

This statement created quite a confusion among the defectors from the Congress and JD(S) who had quit their party and were disqualified and later 13 of them contested the by-elections on BJP ticket.

The Chief Minister had earlier promised ministerial berths to all of them.

However, reflecting on the “internal pulls and pressures”, he indicated that three others to be inducted on Thursday will be the ‘native BJP’ leaders.

Rumour mills were agog that the eleventh legislator among the defectors is Athani MLA Mahesh Kumathalli whereas the three ‘native BJP leaders’ could be Mahadevapura MLA Arvind Limbavali, Hukkeri MLA Umesh Katti and C P Yogeshwar who had lost to former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy from Channapatna.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/suspense-over-ministerial-berths-ahead-of-k---taka-cabinet-expansion.html
135,06-2-20,"Rajini backs CAA, says it’s not against Muslims","nEven as Islamic organisations are holding massive protest rallies all over Tamil Nadu against the Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA), National Population Register(NPR) and National Registry of Citizens (NRC) terming them discriminatory and anti- Muslim, Rajinikanth, Tamil film’s leading superstar, came out in support of the legislation on Wednesday.

“This was the need of an hour and the Narendra Mosi Government should be complimented for bringing in this legislation. There is nothing discriminatory in the CAA. Some religious organisations with the support of certain political parties are spreading the news that the act was against Muslims. This is not correct,” Rajinikkanth said while speaking to reporters outside his Poes Garden residence.

The actor, who is expected to announce the formation of his political outfit anytime from now, said that the Congress and other parties were speaking about such a legislation as early as 2009. “The Narendra Modi Government brought in the legislation and they should be appreciated for the same,” he said

Rajinikanth said there was nothing against the Muslims or any other religion in the CAA. “If the interests of the Muslims are hurt in anyway, Ill be the first person to come out challenging it and leading an agitation for them. The fears and concerns expressed by certain sections against the CAA are misplaced and there is no truth in such campaigns,” the actor explained.

He asked the student community in the country who are agitating against the CAA to seek the counsel of Constitutional experts and clear their doubts instead of becoming pawns in the hands of political parties. Rajinikanth said that he was making these observations after studying thoroughly about the CAA.

“There is no intimidation or threat to Indian Muslims. Some political parties with vested interests are taking this issue in hand. Some religious leaders too have fallen prey to them,” said Rajinikanth.

The superstar’s comments come at a time when MK Stalin , leader of the opposition and DMK chief is touring the State collecting one crore signatures against the CAA. Even on Wednesday, Stalin was seen attending a marriage in Erode district and making the new couple sign the anti-CAA register.

Tameemum Anzari, MLA, who is supporting the AIADMK government, said that Rajinikanth does not know anything other than acting and one need not give any importance to his comments on CAA. “He does not know politics and law and that is why he is speaking like this,” Anzari reacted to the comments by the actor.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rajini-backs-caa--says-it---s-not-against-muslims.html

137,06-2-20,"BJP full of ‘fekus’, threatens with bullets: Mamata","Mamata Banerjee continued her tirade against the BJP for diverting the people’s attention — by supplying fake news — to non-issues — so that they do not raise questions on job loss, inflation and falling economy.

Addressing Trinamool Congress workers at Krishnagar in Nadia district , Banerjee on Wednesday said, BJP is a ‘Feku Party’ which only supplied fake news so as to divert people’s attention from real issues and divide the voters to rule.

“They are generating fake news to divide the people of the country on the basis of religion, and are threatening those who raise questions with bullets,” the Bengal Chief Minister said.

Listing the dangers of showing documents under CAA and NPR, Banerjee said “they are asking from you not only your personal details but also your parents’ certificates — like where they were born and where they lived. Moreover it is not enough to answer such questions. You will have to provide documents for your claims.

From where will you bring the documents of your parents? And if you cannot show such documents then your name will be struck off the citizenship register.

“So I will advice you not to show your documents and not to disclose your facts because they are waiting to trap you in NPR and CAA which are like black magic. Don’t show them your papers until I tell you to do so.”

She asked “will you throw me out of the country if I cannot produce my mother’s birth certificate. If that be the case then 70 percent of people will not be able to show their parents’ papers. So the BJP will drive them all out of the country.

Attacking the BJP for resorting to divisive politics she said, “politics of divide will do no good to India. It will finish the country which is already suffering under economic slowdown. Instead of providing you with rice (bread and butter) they (BJP Government) are imposing Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register for Citizens and National Population Register on you,” and added “I was not born in India that BJP is upholding before the world. I was born in Hindustan which was dreamt of by our sages and great men.”

Attacking the Centre for trying to sell the public sector units which come to the rescue of the people whenever the economy is in dire straits Banerjee said “they (BJP Government) are trying to sell off all PSUs, be it BSNL, LIC, Ordnance factories and the Railways. Unable to revive the country’s economy, they have now chosen the easy way out. But this will only take the country to further

bankruptcy.”

Saying that her own Government had registered an increase in the employment rate by 32 percent whereas national rate of employment had gone down by 40 per cent she maintained, “We managed to stem unemployment as we have chosen various ground-level projects where lakhs of jobs have been created in the last eight years.”

Earlier she compared the BJP with Dussasana—-he wicked brother of Kaurava king Duryodhana in epic Mahabharata who tried to cheat his cousins the Pandavas of their legitimate empire before being defeated in the battle of Mahabharata —Banerjee said “these (BJP are a party of Dussasanas” who also resemble the character of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq a historical figure who is often termed by historians as the “wisest fool.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-full-of----fekus-----threatens-with-bullets--mamata.html

139,06-2-20,Porn on social media a grave concern: Speaker,"Speaker Om Birla on Wednesday suggested a serious discussion in the Lok Sabha on the issues relating to the unbridled pornographic content in the social media as members drew attention towards its ever increasing trend besides that of fake news and sought the Government to penalise social media companies.

Members said the UAE and China have banned child porno sites and asked the Government whether it would do the same.

Maintaining that child pornography is a serious thing and must be banned, Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Government blocked 9,000 sites. Many say adult pornography is “our right”, Prasad said, adding “revenge porno” is also in vogue.

On the suggestions to ban all the sites spreading porn and fake news, the Minister said India should not be compared with China or the Middle East, as “we are a democracy”.

While several MPs had, during question hour, expressed concern over unregulated spread of the social media which spewed fake news and pornography, the Speaker said the issue demands a serious half-an-hour discussion. Prasad promptly agreed to the suggestion saying the upper house had discussed the misuse of social media. The Modi Government had in its first term planned to go whole hog on banning porn sites but due to reasons like impracticality among others it stepped back.

Gaurav Gogoi (Congress) blamed Government for not regulating social media and cited the case of teenager Gopal Sharma who fired at Jamia university site saying he was streaming live but “your Ministers did not remove… it is illegal”. He sought to know whether Government would penalise social media companies.

At this, Prasad said the Government was working on the direction of the Supreme Court. “We are considering penalising,” the Minister said even while pointing that the Data Protection Bill is before the select committee.” As for the shooting incident near Jamia, he said the incident is under investigation. In a written reply, Prasad also said there is no proposal to link social media profiles of users with their Aadhaar numbers and asserted that steps are being taken to curb spreading of fake news and pornography through social media platforms.

His response was to a question on whether the government proposes to formulate any policy to link social media profile of users with their Aadhaar numbers. According to him, the Government has taken several steps to keep a check on the spread of fake news, pornographic and anti-national content via social media platforms.

Prasad said there has also been a rise in irresponsible comments in the social media.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/porn-on-social-media-a-grave-concern--speaker.html

The 182-metre-tall engineering marvel that was founded in a memorial tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat has recently got the tag of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s ‘8 Wonders of SCO’. It is also said to be on the itinerary list of US President Donald Trump who is expected to visit India in the last week of February this year.

Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities Secretary (DEPwD) Shakuntala D Gamlin said, “Statue of Unity meets up almost all accessibility requirements. Features such as conveyor belt, lifts with Braille button, spacious corridors, directional signages, wheel-chair facilities and accessible drinking water and toilets in the Statue of Unity are novel features that need to be replicated universally.”

However, certain other features such as Braille maps, sign language interpreters, audio facility for the visually impaired people needs to be added to make the accessibility complete, she said.

To assess the tourism accessibility of the icon, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2018, the DEPwD under the Union Social Welfare and Justice Ministry recently organised a visit of 14 youths with disabilities from all over India.

“We have noted their observation. For instance, the visually impaired and hearing impaired mentioned the need for Braille maps, Braille booklets on the historical importance of the Statue of Unity and a sign language interpreter for hearing impaired. We have started putting in place an infrastructure that provides a barrier-free access to the visitors with disabilities,” said Gamlin.

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill passed in 2016 mandates upon the Governments including Centre and the States to ensure that those with disability get equal access to education, public facilities which is barrier-free in infrastructure and transport systems.

The Railways Ministry is also ensuring that nearby Kevadiya railway station is ‘Divyang’ friendly. There will be special disabled friendly features such as ramps to wheelchair access, lifts and escalators for movement to one floor to another, washrooms on both sides of the railway station. Disabled-friendly sites are getting global attention.

For instance, Kerala’s ‘Barrier-Free Tourism Project’ recently got global recognition as the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) made a special mention to it as an ‘Emerging Global Destination’ in the Accessible Destination Awards 2019. According to a report, a booming section of the travel market reserved for travellers with disabilities and also the elderly is estimated to be worth an astounding USD 19.2 billion.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/statue-of-unity-to-get-divyang-friendly.html

In remarks viewed as an attempt to placate the former ally of his party, Patil hailed the Sena's role “in protecting Hindus during communal riots and the Marathi manoos in Mumbai” as a “well-wisher” of the Thackeray-led party.

“The Congress is taking the Shiv Sena away from Hindutva and the MNS is being allowed to fill the Hindutva space as part of a conspiracy. The chief minister should understand this plan,” Patil said.The Congress and the NCP are constituents in the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government.

Patil, however, said the BJP welcomes the MNS taking up the Hindutva agenda.

“As a well-wisher of the Shiv Sena and as a Mumbaikar, I feel that it was because of the Sena that Marathi manoos survived in Mumbai. It was because of the Sena that Hindus survived, as shiv sainiks came out to protect people during numerous riots,” the BJP leader said.

Calling himself a “fan” of the Sena, Patil said the Congress was attempting to take the Thackeray-led party away from Hindutva, and attempting to fit the MNS in that space.Indirectly referring to the new saffron flag of the MNS which was unveiled last month, Patil said, “there are some invisible people working behind designing the new flag and other things...CM Thackeray should understand this plan”.Patil also questionned Thackeray's statement in an interview that he had not abandoned Hindutva by joining hands with the NCP and the Congress to form a government.

“Uddhav Thackeray is trying to convince people by saying that the Sena has not given up Hindutva. If you really have not given up Hindutva, then why are you not demanding Bharat Ratna for Veer Savarkar, and (not) supporting the CAA?” he questionned.

Thackeray has in fact said that the new citizenship law was not aimed at taking away anybody's citizenship. However, he has opposed the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).Patil also questionned the “Hindutvavadi” Sena's “silence” on V D Savarkar being dubbed “homosexual”.

144,06-2-20,"‘Love Jihad’ is a reality in Kerala, claims BJP leader","A day after the Union Home Ministry told Parliament that no case of “Love Jihad” has been reported by any of the central agencies, the BJP on Wednesday claimed that it was a reality, which is happening in Kerala.

Throwing its weight behind the Bishops of Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, who kicked up a debate in the state recently over the incidents of “Love Jihad” in the state, BJP national executive member P K Krishnadas urged the Home Ministry to carry out a “comprehensive probe” into such cases to bring out real facts.

“The term 'Love jihad' is not defined under the extant laws but it is a fact that Love Jihad is happening (in Kerala),” Krishnadas told reporters here. He accused the present CPI(M)-led LDF government and previous Congress-led UDF government of not giving a proper report to the Centre over the issue of “Love Jihad”. “The state governments controlled by the UDF and LDF give reports to the Centre saying that such incidents are not at all happening in Kerala,” Krishnadas alleged.

He said the BJP shared the views of the Syro-Malabar Church on the issue of “Love Jihad”. “The complaint and allegations raised by the Syro-Malabar Church on the issue of “Love Jihad” is based on facts and truth. We share their views,” he said.

The Syro-Malabar Church also reacted to the Central government's clarification on “Love Jihad”, saying the circumstances under which the Synod of the Church made the statement on the issue still exists.

Seeking an investigation into the issue, the Church, in a statement, made it clear that the statement of the Synod was not meant to disturb the communal harmony prevail in the Kerala society.

It said the synod had only expressed its opinion that inter-religious love affairs create troubles in family and society at large and that such cases should be probed.

Krishnadas said the BJP also does not see the “Love Jihad” as an issue between two religions.

“Don't mistake it as an issue between two religions. There is no religion for terrorists. We don't see it as a Hindu-Muslim issue or a Christian-Muslim issue,” he s

The officials are accused of siphoning funds amounting to Rs 1,000 crore from the State Resource Centre (SRC) and the Physical Referral Rehabilitation Centre (PRRC) of the State government over a period of 10 years.

On January 30, the Chhattisgarh High Court had directed the CBI to take over the probe in the matter.

147,06-2-20,8-fold increase in cyber attack in India: Report,"In the last five years, cyber security incidents like hacking, breaching computer systems among others witnessed an almost eight-fold increase in India. In 2019, as per information tracked by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), nearly 3.94 lakh cyber security incidents were reported as against 49,455 incidents in 2015, 50,362 in 2016, 53,117 in 2017, 2,08,456 in 2018 and 3,94,499 incidents in 2019.

According to the CERT-In, 54 websites of Central Ministries, departments and State Governments were hacked in 2019, against 110 sites in 2018. These cyber attacks originated from Pakistan, Algeria, Brazil, China, France, Netherlands, North Korea, Russia, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, USA and Vietnam.

In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Sanjay Dhotre said as per the information reported to and tracked by CERT-In cyber security incidents are observed across sectors such as academia, e-commerce, energy, entertainment, finance, Government, healthcare, information and technology, manufacturing, telecom and transportation. “With the increase in the proliferation of Information Technology and related services there is a rise in cyber security incidents in the country as well as globally,” Dhotre said.

“There have been attempts from time to time to launch cyber-attacks on Indian cyber space. It has been observed that attackers are compromising computer systems located in different parts of the world and use masquerading techniques and hidden servers to hide the identity of actual systems from which the attacks are being launched,” the ministry said in its reply. Measures include audit of government websites and applications, formulation of a crisis management plan for countering cyber attacks, and the launch of botnet cleaning and malware analysis centre ‘Cyber Swachhta Kendra’.

Kundankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) came under a cyberattack in October last year. The damage was in the form of data theft, the same data can be used to enhance future attacks on the power plant. The malware was linked by experts to the North-Korean group Lazarus, infected a computer in the plants external network, rather than the operational one.

According to reports, even ISRO faced attacks prior to the Chandrayan-2 mission. The most prominent trend was the drastic increase in the volume, intensity, and sophistication of cyber-attack campaigns targeting Indian enterprises in 2019. According to a research, Indian organisations have faced over three times more cyberattack than the global average, with cryptocurrency mining malware impacting most of the entities.

According to a CISCO Annual Cyber Security Report, 53% of all cyber attacks led to financial damages of more than $500K (including lost revenue, customers, opportunities, and out-of-pocket costs among others) for organisations in 2018.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/8-fold-increase-in-cyber-attack-in-india--report.html
148,06-2-20,Any ‘willing’ woman should be allowed to act as surrogate: Panel,"Not only close relatives but any woman — even a single woman — who is “willing” should be allowed to act as a surrogate, a parliamentary panel has recommended besides suggesting 15 major changes that include deleting the definition of ‘infertility’ as the inability to conceive after five years of unprotected intercourse on the ground that it was too long a period for a couple to wait for a child.

Headed by BJP’s Bhupender Yadav, the Rajya Sabha Select Committee which tabled the report in Parliament on Wednesday also recommended that ‘single Indian woman’ - either divorcee or widow - in the 35- to 45-year age group and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) may be allowed to avail surrogacy.

However, it has strongly backed the provision of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019 allowing only altruistic surrogacy and not commercial surrogacy as it opined that “the sublime and divine instinct of motherhood could not be allowed to be turned into mechanical paid service of pro-creation devoid of divine warmth and affection.”

Noting that restricting the surrogate mother to be a ‘close relative’ potentially limits the availability of surrogate mothers, affecting the genuinely needy persons, the panel has recommended removal of this requirement from the Bill.

The Committee recommended that “a willing woman shall act as surrogate mother and be permitted to undergo surrogacy procedures as per the provisions of this Act.”

It also suggested increasing the insurance cover for the surrogate mother from proposed 16 months to 36 months. The Bill is yet to be passed by the Rajya Sabha.

Regarding the eligibility criteria for availing surrogacy procedure, the committee recommended removing the provision of requirement of five years as the period of inability to conceive before opting for the procedure.

It noted that there may be certain proven medical conditions like absence of uterus by birth, non-functional uterus, removal of uterus due to cancer, fibroids etc or patients with chronic medical condition where normal pregnancy is ruled out and it is medically proven beyond any doubt that surrogacy is the only option.

The Committee also recommended a modification in the definition of altruistic surrogacy so as to cover ‘other prescribed expenses’ on nutritional food required and maternity-wear etc, vital for the wellbeing and upkeep of the surrogate mother.

As a general recommendation, the select committee recommended that the Assisted Reproductive Technologies (Regulation) Bill which is awaiting cabinet approval may be taken up before the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill since the ART Bill primarily deals with technical, scientific and medical aspects which also apply to storage of embryo, gamete, oocyte etc. as contained in the Surrogacy Bill.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/any----willing----woman-should-be-allowed-to-act-as-surrogate--panel.html
149,06-2-20,Shaheen Bagh firing incident rocks RS,"The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday saw sharp exchanges between the treasury and Congress members when two BJP members raised the issue of alleged involvement of an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) worker in the Shaheen Bagh firing incident in New Delhi recently. However, the house ran smoothly after the brief war of words and the Elders raised matters of public importance.

The first exchange took place soon after ministers tabled listed papers when the house commenced proceedings and Vijay Goel (BJP) tried to raise the issue. Congress members strongly opposed it.

Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu did not allow Goel to proceed with his arguments and asked members to raise permitted issues for Zero Hour. Later, another BJP member Bhupender Yadav referred to the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections and without naming any party or place brought up the issue of firing incident.

He said the Delhi Police has released certain pictures following its investigation in the firing incident and said how a political party(in an apparent reference to the AAP) can think of sending a legal notice to the police officer. Congress members objected to this and Yadav retorted that the gunman does not belong to the main Opposition party. The Delhi Police has said Kapil Baisala, who opened fired at the Shaheen Bagh protest site last week is a member of the Aam Aadmi Party.

Meanwhile, Jairam Ramesh(Congress) said states were not getting share of taxes as per the devolution formula. He said states should get 42 per cent share but they are expected to get only 30 per cent during the current fiscal. According to him, the devolution was only 35 per cent in the previous two years.

His party colleague Digivjaya Singh said the Centre was not giving dues of states’ shares in taxes because of lower revenue collections. He said the share of Madhya Pradesh in GST compensation has been reduced by Rs 14,000 crore.

Akhilesh Prasad Singh (Cong) made a case for increasing the length of the airstrip at the Patna airport so that larger planes too could land there.

People from all sections and of all ages have gathered together and launched a movement, Chowdhury said, adding it was a victory for democracy as the BJP was compelled to step back.

“You cannot weaken Hindustan (India). We all have together made this nation.... Plurality is the heartbeat (dhadkan) we should save it,” he said. The true spirit of the Constitution was that each and everyone should feel that this country was his own, he said. The BJP, he said, was dividing the country and it was logical to fight against it. Swami Vivekananda, the Congress leader said, used to say that “our motherland was a junction of two great forces, Hinduism and Islam”. He also said every human soul is potentially divine. “Our goal is to manifest the divinity in human beings.”

“You are pseudo humanist, nationalist and Hindu... You should become a true Hindu like us (Congress),” he said, referring to the ruling BJP. On Kashmir, he claimed the cases of stone pelting have risen post the abrogation of Article 370. He demanded that the House pass a resolution for integration of PoK into India.

The Chairman also said the Indian parliament is sovereign and the message should be sent loud and clear when a Shiv Sena raised the issue in the Rajya Sabha.

Raising the issue in the House in the morning session, Anil Desai (Shiv Sena) suggested that a resolution should be passed that India will not tolerate any interference from other countries in its internal matters.

Reacting to it, Naidu said no other country has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of India. “I want to make it very clear, as Chairman of the House and also as Vice President of the country, whatever issues are there, Indian Parliament is a sovereign authority to discuss and decide.

“Outside countries have no right to interfere in our internal affairs,” he said adding other countries should take care of their own respective matters. Naidu wondered whether those countries would like if Indian Parliament discusses issues like Brexit.

153,06-2-20,Opp raises J&K leaders’ detention in LS,"Raising the issue of detention of National Conference (NC) leader Farooq Abdullah and other senior political leaders from Jammu & Kashmir, the Opposition parties on Wednesday attacked the Government in the Parliament for “illegally” detaining them and demanded they should be freed forthwith.

Former Chief Ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti were among the many mainstream politicians detained after the Centre revoked Jammu & Kashmir’s special status under Article 370 on August 5 last year. The state was also bifurcated into the union territories of Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh.

“Three former Chief Ministers, including Farooq Abdullah, are languishing in jails for past six months, they have been put behind bars without giving any proper reason,” Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said in the Lok Sabha, while demanding the release of the sitting member.

Later Congress members along with those of several other Opposition parties walked out of the House.

TMC leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay also flagged the issue of detention of Abdullah and said the issue was also raised during the all-party meeting. Members from the NCP, DMK, TDP and the RJD also voiced concern over the detention of Abdullah.

Majeed Memon (NCP) asked what kind of terror was created by Farooq Abdullah that he was detained and could not attend Parliament. The National Conference leader is an MP from Srinagar. Memon said the constitutional validity of abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir is yet to undergo judicial scrutiny.

DMK’s Vaiko termed August 5, 2019 as the “blackest day” in the history of India saying three former chief ministers were detained and added that it was a pre-mediated conspiracy of “Hindutva forces”.

Earlier, Congress MP K Suresh raised the issue of release of Abdullah, but it was cut short by the Speaker. It is the responsibility of the government and House to ensure his welfare and also that he exercises his right as an elected representative, Suresh said.

The ruling BJP defended the Government’s decisions on Jammu and Kashmir and the amended citizenship law, saying they have strengthened democracy and the nation, and slammed the opposition for backing protests like in Shaheen Bagh. Members from the NCP, DMK, TDP and RJD said the Constitution was “under threat” and the protests against the CAA were spontaneous.

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too said it had been six months since former Jammu & Kashmir Chief Ministers had been detained and asked whether India is still a democracy. “Six months ago we were asking how long this will carry on? Now we are asking whether we are still a democracy or not,” she tweeted.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opp-raises-j-k-leaders----detention-in-ls.html

155,06-2-20,"Soil health cards help reduce fertiliser overuse, says study","Farmers, who commonly overuse fertilisers in almost everything they grow, are being slowly nudged away from the dangerous practice due to soil health cards (SHC). The Ministry of Agriculture has said that a study conducted by the National Productivity Council (NPC) says the application of SHC recommendations has led to a decline of 8-10 per cent in use of chemical fertilizers. This has enabled the farmers to understand the soil health parameters and improve its productivity by judicious application of soil nutrients.

According to the Ministry, nearly 11.69 crore soil health cards have been distributed to farmers in the last two years. A pilot project “development of model villages” is being implemented under which the sampling and testing of cultivable soil is being encouraged in partnership with the farmers.

Under the project a Model Village has been selected for aggregation of soil samples and analysis of each agricultural holding. As part of the scheme 13.53 lakh soil health cards have been distributed during the year 2019-20.

The scheme launched by the Modi Government during the financial year 2014-15 with a view to address the decline of soil nutrients, has started reaping fruit.

Under the Central Government’s Soil Health Card Scheme Phase-I (Years 2015 to 2017) 10.74 crore cards were distributed, while under the Phase-II 11.69 crore cards have been give away during the period 2017-19. For setting up of soil health laboratories under the scheme, the States have been sanctioned 429 static labs, 102 new mobile labs, 8,752 mini labs, 1,562 village-level laboratories and strengthening of 800 existing labs.

The scheme provides for the analysis of soil composition by the State Governments once in every two years so that remedial steps can be taken to improve soil nutrients. Farmers can track their soil samples and also obtain their soil health card report.

Under the scheme village youth and farmers up to 40 years of age are eligible to set up soil health laboratories and undertake testing. A laboratory costs up to Rs 5 lakh, 75 per cent of which can be funded by the Central and State Governments. The NPC study revealed worrying degradation of soils across regions. Nitrogen, an essential constituent of all proteins, is scarce in soils of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and parts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu.

Phosphorous, which helps plants to convert light into food, has grossly depleted in Himachal, Haryana, UP, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and parts of Bihar, Jharkhand, MP, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.

“You give her additional income in her pocket and let her decide, how much they want to save rather than link savings and make it in some sense compulsory,” he told PTI.

Industry experts, however, said that two tax regimes with optionality for personal tax, as in the case of corporate taxes, only make the structure more complicated.

“Let them decide according to their situation... My view is that middle class’ saving propensity won’t come down,” Kumar asserted.

As an economist, Kumar said he was thrilled about this simplification of the process.

However, eminent economist and National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) professor Ila Patnaik believes that households are generally short sighted and do not save adequately for old age.

“This is one reason for governments to be paternalistic and nudge people towards saving for pension and old age. This was one rationale for tax exemption like 80C. The new system reduces these incentives,” she opined.

Patnaik said for infrastructure investment, India needs long term savings, not just from abroad, but also domestic savings.

“These were also linked to tax exemptions. In a study on the subject my colleagues and I found that households respond to tax incentives and save in instruments that give them benefits. These will also be impacted,” she noted.

According to latest data, over the past six years, India’s savings rate has been considerably declining.

At the height of India’s growth phase in 2012, the overall saving rate was around 36 per cent but it is now down to 30 per cent.

Talking about the ‘Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme’, Kumar said the aim of the latest measure is to reduce litigation and see finalisation of 4.83 lakh stuck cases in appellate forums under the direct taxes category.

Under the scheme, a taxpayer would be required to pay only the amount of the disputed tax and will get complete waiver of interest and penalty provided they pay by March 31, 2020.

A similar scheme, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, for cases stuck in litigation under the indirect taxes category, was brought by the government in the last Budget.

Asked whether government’s record Rs 2.10 lakh crore disinvestment target for the next fiscal is too ambitious, Kumar said this (2020-21) disinvestment target is not an unachievable target at all.

“But this ambitious target also reflects the Prime Minister’s view that we are going to create more space for the private sector... He

160,06-2-20,Service sector growth hits 7-year high in Jan,"India’s services sector activity surged to a seven-year high in January driven by sharp increase in new business orders, leading to job creation and business optimism amid favourable market conditions, a monthly survey said on Wednesday.

The IHS Markit India Services Business Activity Index rose from 53.3 in December to 55.5 in January, signalling the strongest upturn in output in seven years.

“The Indian service sector sprung to life at the start of 2020, defying expectations of fragility and building on to the momentum gained at the end of 2019,” said Pollyanna de Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.

New work intakes also expanded to the greatest extent in seven years. Fresh business orders were mainly generated domestically, as exports decreased at the start of the year. A number of panellists mentioned weaker demand from China, Europe and the US.

“With business revenues rising, service providers continued to increase capacity to meet further strong growth in sales. This is good news for jobseekers, particularly when we consider the results from the manufacturing industry which showed the steepest upturn in employment since August 2012,” Lima said.

Meanwhile, the Composite PMI Output Index that maps both the manufacturing and services sector increased from 53.7 in December to a seven-year high of 56.3 in January.

On the prices front, the uptick in service sector activity was accompanied by intensification of inflationary pressures, with input costs rising to the greatest extent since February 2013 and output charge inflation picking up to a near two-year high.

“One worrying development, however, was the trend for inflation. The service survey pointed to the sharpest increase in input prices in just under seven years, with companies mostly absorbing the added cost burdens themselves instead of fully passing

these on to their customers,” Lima said.

Lima further added that “this may translate into quicker increases in selling prices in months to come, which may curb sales. Firms could also choose to restrict hiring in order to protect profit margins”.

Amid slowing economic growth and rising inflation, the Reserve Bank of India will unveil its last monetary policy for the current financial year on Thursday.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/service-sector-growth-hits-7-year-high-in-jan-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/service-sector-growth-hits-7-year-high-in-jan.html
161,06-2-20,China to cut tariffs on USD 75 billion in US imports: official,"China on Thursday said it will halve punitive tariffs on USD 75 billion in US imports from February 14, a month after Beijing and Washington signed a truce in their long-running trade war.

The reduction will apply to levies of five per cent and 10 per cent that were imposed on more than 1,700 items in September, according to the State Council Tariff Commission.

Products that had been hit by the 10 percent tariffs included fresh seafood, poultry and soybeans.

Tariffs also applied to items such as tungsten lamps for scientific and medical purposes, as well as some types of aircraft.

The move is aimed at ""promoting the healthy and stable development of China-US economic and trade relations"", the Commission said in a statement.

It added that the reduction will kick in at 0501 GMT on February 14 -- the same day Washington is expected to halve tariffs on USD 120 billion worth of Chinese products.

The Commission added it ""hopes that both parties will be able to abide by their agreement, strive to implement its relevant content, (and) boost market confidence"".

Other retaliatory tariffs, however, remain in place.

The US and China in January signed a partial deal that dialled down tensions in their bruising trade war, with Beijing agreeing to buy an additional USD 200 billion in American goods over the next two years.

As part of the phase one deal, the US would halve its tariffs on USD 120 billion of Chinese goods to 7.5 per cent, and the Trump administration called off added tariffs that would have taken effect last December.

At President Donald Trump's annual State of the Union address this week, he said US-China relations are the ""best"" ever currently.

China's latest tariff reductions come as it grapples with a shortage of resources in a fight against a new coronavirus, which has claimed more than 560 lives.

On Tuesday, a top US trade official said the virus outbreak will delay Beijing's plans to buy goods from the US under the phase one deal.

But Washington expects ""minimal impact"" from the virus on the US economy.

China's recent virus outbreak has caused Beijing to impose travel restrictions across cities, with millions of consumers staying home during its otherwise busy Spring Festival holiday.

This is expected to take a hit on China's already slowing economy, as companies and factories delayed resumption of operations.

Over the weekend, Beijing announced that US imports that can be used in its fight against the deadly virus will be also be exempted from retaliatory tariffs imposed in the trade war.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-to-cut-tariffs-on-usd-75-billion-in-us-imports--official-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/china-to-cut-tariffs-on-usd-75-billion-in-us-imports--official.html

Additional sessions judge Prashant Rajvaidya rejected Chudawala's application for pre-arrest bail. The court also refused to grant her interim protection from arrest to enable her to move the high court.

Prosecution, while opposing relief for her, had claimed that Chudawala was “supporting a person who is officially enemy of state”.

Chudawala is a student of the prestigious Tata Institute of Social Sciences in the city.

According to the police, during a rally of the Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Transgender-Queer community at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai last week,Chudawala shouted the slogan “Sharjeel Tere Sapno Ko Hum Manzil Tak Pahuchaege” (Sharjeel, we will realise your dreams).

Her lawyer Vijay Hiremath had argued that an innocuous slogan was taken out of contextto allege that she wanted to create hatred against a community.

“There was only one line,which was said only once...Has it done any harm? It was not aimed at public servant or government machinery...It is not sedition at all ....It does not create hatred towards government, community oranyone,” he said.

“We may not agree with her statement but that does not amount to sedition,” the lawyer added.

India’s services sector activity surged to a seven-year high in January driven by sharp increase in new business orders, leading to job creation and business optimism amid favourable market conditions, a monthly IHS Markit survey said.

Earlier this week, another survey said the country’s manufacturing sector activity climbed to a near eight-year high in January.

On the global arena, positive global cues persisted after Chinese policymakers promised to unveil more measures to support an economy jolted by a coronavirus outbreak.

165,06-2-20,Fitch: Budget light on new structural reforms,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget for 2020-21 was light on new structural reforms, Fitch Ratings said on Wednesday adding it had not materially altered its forecasts for India’s economic growth to rise to 5.6 per cent in the next fiscal from 4.6 per cent in 2019-20.

“We believe it is highly unlikely the country’s general government debt will be brought within the ceiling of 60 per cent of GDP by FY25, as stipulated in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act,” it said.

Fitch projected that the government debt will remain close to 70 per cent of GDP throughout the period to 2021-22. “India’s high public debt levels are a weakness relative to its rating peers (the BBB median stood at 41.1 per cent in 2019),” it said.

The Union Budget 2020-21 implies a modest degree of slippage from previous targets to consolidate public finances, it said. “However, its contents are consistent with our expectations when we affirmed the country’s sovereign rating at ‘BBB-’/Stable in December 2019.?”

The Budget projects a deficit of 3.5 per cent in 2020-21 and implies a further postponement of the Central government’s medium-term fiscal deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP as it prioritises efforts to support economic growth in the context of the ongoing sharp slowdown.

“A slippage of 0.5 per cent of GDP in both FY20 and FY21 relative to the earlier targets is in line with the tendency for deficit outturns to exceed targets in the past few years,” Fitch said.

Sitharaman projected that the deficit would fall from 3.8 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 3.5 per cent in 2020-21.

“We believe most assumptions in the budget, such as nominal GDP growth of 10 pr cent and a 9.2 per cent rise in fiscal revenues, are credible,” Fitch said. “However, risks are likely skewed towards the downside, particularly for revenues in light of previously announced cuts in the corporate income tax rate and newly unveiled income tax rate reductions.”

The tax cuts may stimulate economic activity in the medium term, but their impact on fiscal revenues is likely to be negative in the short term, it said.

“The Budget was light on new structural reforms, although the government had already unveiled some measures last year,” it said.

The finance minister announced some easing of restrictions on foreign portfolio inflows, and schemes to encourage manufacturing in electronics and textile sectors. “However, we have not materially altered our forecasts for India’s economic growth, which we expect to pick up to 5.6 per cent in FY21 from 4.6 per cent in FY20,” it said.

Fitch said a number of steps affecting financial institutions were announced in the budget, but they only partially address the issues that are facing the sector.

For example, the extension of the credit guarantee mechanism to the debt of troubled non-bank financial companies will likely help provide some interim support for wholesale and housing-finance companies, but is unlikely to restore confidence in a sector that continues to face high risk aversion from creditors, it said.

“Another downside risk in the government’s fiscal projections is the degree to which it expects asset sales to fill the revenue gap left by tax cuts. Its divestment target for FY21 is around 3x as large as its expected total for realised sales in FY20.

“To achieve this, the government would have to address its persistent tendency to fall short of announced asset-sale targets; asset sales in FY20, for example, were only 40 per cent of the planned total,” Fitch said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fitch--budget-light-on-new-structural-reforms.html
166,06-2-20,Coronavirus: Surat diamond industry stares at Rs 8K cr loss,"The Surat diamond industry is likely to face a loss of around Rs 8,000 crore in next two months as Hong Kong, which is a major export destination, has declared a state of emergency due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, say experts.

Hong Kong is a major business hub for the Surat diamond industry, but schools and colleges have been closed there till the first week of March and even the businesses are seeing a dip in view of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

According to Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) regional chairman Dinesh Navadiya, polished diamonds worth around Rs 50,000 crore are exported from Surat to Hong Kong every year.

“That’s around 37 per cent of the total exports from here. Now, due to coronavirus scare, Hong Kong has declared a month-long vacation. Gujarati traders having offices there are coming back to India,” he said.

If the situation does not improve, it will have a huge impact on the Surat diamond industry, which polishes 99 per cent of all rough diamonds imported in the country, he said.

“The Surat diamond industry is staring at a loss of around Rs 8,000 crore for February and March,” he added.

Another industry expert and diamond merchant Pravin Nanavati said there is a possibility of cancellation of an international jewellery exhibition in Hong Kong, to be held next month, due to the coronoavirus scare, which would hit the jewellery business in Surat.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/coronavirus--surat-diamond-industry-stares-at-rs-8k-cr-loss.html

168,06-2-20,Hopeful of listing LIC in next fiscal: DEA Secy,"The Government is hopeful of selling minority stake in Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) in the next fiscal, a senior official said on Wednesday. Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty said it would take about 8-9 months to prepare accounts and do the required legal tweaking before an IPO of the insurance behemoth could be launched.

“I am certain that it will happen next year. It takes about 8-9 months for preparation of its accounts. What kind of legal tweaks that need to be made,” he said at a CII event here.

Chakraborty said an initial public offering (IPO) of LIC would also help to discipline into the organisation and improve depth of the market.

“I am quite hopeful that we should be able to finish it before March 31, 2021. The money of course will come through, that’s less of an issue. It will be a substantial chunk that not withstanding when you bring into public space such organisation,” he added.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her 2020-21 Budget had said that LIC will be listed as part of the government disinvestment initiative.

Currently, the Government owns 100 per cent stake in LIC.

The 60-year-old state-owned firm, LIC, is the country’s largest insurer, controlling more than 70 per cent of the market share. The insurer has a market share of 76.28 per cent in number of policies and 71 per cent in first-year premiums.

LIC has many subsidiaries, including IDBI Bank. It acquired controlling stake in the bank last year.

169,06-2-20,RBI estimates GDP to expand at 6 pc in FY21,"The Reserve Bank of India on Thursday projected the economy to expand by 6 per cent during the next financial year, pegging it at the lower end of the GDP growth estimate of the Economic Survey.

The survey, tabled in Parliament last month, estimated the GDP growth during FY21 at 6-6.5 per cent.

After three-day deliberations, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das, observed that the economy continues to be weak and the output gap remains negative.

Real GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected at 5 per cent in the December 2019 policy.

The central bank said that for 2020-21, the growth outlook will be influenced by several factors, including level of private consumption, and external factors.

It said private consumption, particularly in rural areas, is expected to recover on the back of improved Rabi crop prospects. The recent rise in food prices has shifted the terms of trade in favour of agriculture, which will support rural incomes.

The easing of global trade uncertainties should encourage exports and spur investment activity, it said.

""The breakout of the coronavirus may, however, impact tourist arrivals and global trade,"" it added.

Also, the rationalisation of personal income tax rates in the Union Budget 2020-21 should support domestic demand along with measures to boost rural and infrastructure spending.

Taking into consideration different factors, RBI said ""GDP growth for 2020-21 is projected at 6.0 per cent – in the range of 5.5-6.0 per cent in H1 and 6.2 per cent in Q3,""

Pelosi has been one of Trump’s fiercest critics and the top Democrat was the one who first launched formal impeachment process in the House of Representatives against the president last year. President Trump has frequently taunted the 79-year-old lawmaker as “Crazy Nancy”.

The mutual snubbing began the moment Trump, seeking re-election, walked into the House chamber on Tuesday night for his third State of the Union address in which he touted his administration’s achievements during the past three years.

It was the first time the two had come face-to-face since she stormed out of a White House meeting four months ago.

On Tuesday night, the sour dynamic was on display to all from the start, The New York Times noted. The tensions over impeachment appeared to surface early on, however, as Pelosi refused to introduce Trump by saying it was her “distinct honour” and “high privilege” to do so, as is tradition.

Iyman Faris, a 50-year-old naturalized US citizen, was convicted in 2003 of providing material support to al-Qaeda. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Judge Staci Yandle of the US District Court for the Southern District of Illinois on Monday entered an order revoking the naturalized US citizenship of the convicted terrorist.

In its order revoking his US citizenship, the court found that Faris was ineligible for naturalization and unlawfully procured his citizenship through willful misrepresentation of material facts.

The US Justice Depart-ment said that among other actions in support of al Qaeda, Faris had evaluated in 2002 the practicality of a plot to collapse the Brooklyn Bridge in New York using gas cutters, communicating his assessment to al-Qaeda via coded messages. In 2000, Faris had travelled to Afghanistan where he met bin Laden and other high-ranking members of al-Qaeda at the terror group’s training camp. He had also researched information about ultralight airplanes for a senior al-Qaeda leader, and arranged for airline tickets to be issued to the al-Qaeda operatives. In its February 3 order, the US District Court for the Southern District of Illinois granted the government’s motion for summary judgment revoking Faris’s US citizenship on multiple bases.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/pak-man--who-once-met-osama--to--lose-us-citizenship.html
175,06-2-20,That fleeting moment,"Inspired by a range of personal archives and old photographs, artist Remen Chopra’s works speak volumes about her personal journey. By Sakshi Sharma

Two-dimensional art installations using mulmul panel fill a spiral staircase. Several pictures of a woman in red kurta and blue pants in different poses are juxtaposed here. These look like a series of photos where the subject is caught mid-motion delving deep into spirituality. Amid a white backdrop, the works denote transition through time and captures several movements of the human body.

This is the first thing that grabs our attention as we witness artist Remen Chopra’s exhibition at Jorbagh. She takes us around and narrates some stories of how she constructed these thought-provoking pieces that resonate with the passage of time as well as human emotions.

“While shifting, I was going through migration and displacement. It was then that I realised that in order to calm myself, I need to find answers. So after going through all this, I questioned myself, ‘What makes me feel at home and safe?’ So I started writing and researching. I also tried to explore my maternal space. This is how the whole exhibition came together organically,” says Remen.

Through Memory’s Cut: Its Deep Embrace, she has transformed 24 Jor Bagh into a series of personal spaces, which reflect her reminiscence of home. The works depict her personal journey of migration as she questions the notions of home, lineage, space and time.

She uses various media like photography, drawing, sculpture, textiles and sound, which showcase her personal and familial histories of migration. The works include poetry and personal objects that were passed on matrilineally from one generation to the other.

The artist also recalls the stories of her family from Tehran, Rawalpindi and Shimla, which were narrated to her by her grandmother. She uses wood and embroidery on a cloth to write a poem, Under the lime tree, from her grandmother’s archive.

Inspired by Egyptian architecture, Imaginary landscapes: Shimla, Rawalpindi, is a work with recycled wood. The artist creates imaginary topographic maps to explore the feeling of dislocation. The maps, painted rust on three different black walls with triangular ends at some places, depict both the places, Rawalpindi and Shimla, which co-exist in one space and time. Along with the maps, there is also a collection of wooden pieces kept in a linear form. When one tries to comprehend them, the artist tells us that it is Urdu poetry.

Moving further, we also come across pieces which makes one wonder how she has constructed such complex monochromatic montages and layers of photographs with glass and mulmul. They vividly capture a fleeting moment of time. While the figures evoke a sense of mystery in us, the artist grows nostalgic.

One can clearly see a strong presence of the feminine forms in her works which reflect her idea of regeneration, nurturing and balancing. To what shore would you cross is a work with recycled wood. A maroon heirloom carpet that has been passed on from one generation to another has two rust lines at the ends which look like sculptures. It also represents the vagina and questions birth and regeneration. The artist questions, “how do we relate to our mothers and grandmothers through objects?”

All her works are in black and white with just a hint of rust in places. While one wonders if she has intentionally done it to revive old memories, the artist says, “I always work with monochromes. When I was studying in New York and exploring the idea and notion of time, I saw a lot of black and white films and got inspired by cinematic references. That was when I let go of the colours.”

Time has been a constant attraction for the artist. She says that the continuous circular movement of the past, present and future is hard to ignore. This is quite evident in her works as they seem to bridge the gap between history and now.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/that-fleeting-moment-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/that-fleeting-moment.html
176,06-2-20,Milan gets flu chill,"Coronavirus blocks 3 Chinese brands from fashion week

Italian fashion officials forecasted a nearly 2 per cent drop in first-half revenues due to the virus emerging from China, which also is preventing three Chinese fashion houses from traveling to Milan Fashion Week later this month.

Chinese consumers are the biggest luxury spenders in the world, including in Italy, where they represent 35 per cent of big-ticket spenders, more than Russians, Arabs and Americans combined, according to a 2019 study by Global Blue, a tourism shopping tax refund company.

Their absence during the Chinese New Year travel period is being sorely felt in Milan’s MonteNapoleone District of luxury boutiques, where 48 brands have created capsule collections dedicated to the Year of the Rat in anticipation of the usual influx of Chinese tourists.

A drop in big-spending Chinese tourists along with the negative impact on luxury sales in China, where Italian brands have a strong retail presence, are expected to decrease first-half revenues in the Italian luxury industry by 1.8 per cent. That will in turn put a drag on projections of 3 per cent revenue growth in 2020 over the 90 billion euros ($99 billion) posted last year, according to Italian National Fashion Chamber president Carlo Capasa.

“Everyone hoped that we would grow this year, but instead we have this terrible setback. We hope that they find a solution and there is a relaunch,’’ Capasa said.

Due to the virus, the Chinese fashion houses Angela Chen, Ricostru and Hui had to cancel their runway turns during Milan Fashion Week, which runs from February 18 to 24, while an estimated 1,000 Chinese journalists, buyers and other fashion industry insiders also will be absent.

The fashion chamber will express its solidarity with it partners in China with a digital event, showcasing eight Chinese designers over video with runway shows, backstage peeks and interviews. The initiative, titled China, we are with you, will open with a runway show of a Chinese designer whose production is mostly in Europe and the United States, so is unaffected by the virus, Capasa said. The identity of the fashion house was being kept secret. “We want to confront this emergency with a positive message, trying to keep ties very open with our Chinese partners,’’ Capasa said.

The Chinese brand Annakiki was able to maintain its place on the schedule because 95 per cent of the apparel collection was already in Milan and its accessories are all made in Italy. Designer Anna Yang was still in Shenzhen, putting the finishing touches on the last pieces before traveling to Milan.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/milan-gets-flu-chill-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/milan-gets-flu-chill.html

The US president said that under his leadership, jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and “our country is thriving and highly respected again.” “Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback. America’s enemies are on the run, America’s fortunes are on the rise and America’s future is blazing bright,” he added.

Trump underlined the country’s economic gains under his leadership, asserting that “the American Dream is back” and is “stronger than ever before”. “The years of economic decay are over...Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power and prestige,” Trump said on the eve of his likely acquittal by the Senate in the impeachment trial.

Alaya has been getting rave reviews for her performance in Jawaani Jaaneman. She played the onscreen daughter of Saif and Tabu in the film.

‘Without sounding pompous I'd like to mention that I have never really cast an actor for his commercial viability. As long as he or she fits my role I cast him. I had cast Aditya (Roy Kapur) in Aashiqui 2 before which he had done character roles in a couple of films but not lead. When I met him I felt he would be the perfect choice for Aashiqui 2.’

185,06-2-20,"Yes, I am black, that’s my skin: Bavuma","South Africa batsman Temba Bavuma, who played a match-winning knock against England has accepted that constantly being viewed through the prism of his skin colour has affected him.

“It has been hard,” Bavuma, who was speaking for the first time since his recall to the national team last month, was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo.

“It’s not so much the dropping part, all players get dropped, everyone goes through slumps of not scoring well. The awkwardness and uncomfortability from my side is when you are thrown into talks of transformation.

“Yes, I am black, that’s my skin. But I play cricket because I love it. I’d like to think the reason I am in the team is because of performances I have put forward in my franchise side, and also for the national team, whenever I have been able to. The discomfort was there, having to navigate myself around all those types of talks. Players get dropped, I am not the last guy to get dropped.

That’s something we’ve come to accept,” he added.

According to South Africa rules, the national team has to always field six players of their colour, including two black Africans.

De Kock made 107 and Temba Bavuma hit 98 as South Africa chased down an England total of 258 for eight with 14 balls to spare.

De Kock and Bavuma shared a second wicket partnership of 173 off 170 balls, dominating an England team which included only five of the side that won the World Cup last year.

De Kock made his 107 off 113 balls with 11 fours and a six, while Bavuma faced 103 deliveries, hitting five fours and two sixes.

“It was a good night. It feels good to get back to winning ways,” said De Kock.

“We had one or two chats about how we want to take this ODI team forward. Today was a good start — but it’s only one game.”

South Africa’s team also had an experimental feel, featuring only six of the squad who had a dismal World Cup.

“We were way off the mark,” admitted England captain Eoin Morgan. “South Africa completely outplayed us in every department.”

Joe Denly was largely responsible for England reaching what appeared to be a reasonable total on a slow pitch.

187,06-2-20,Future of Indian cricket in safe hands: Akhtar,"Former Pakistani speedster Shoaib Akhtar has heaped praise on the Indian colts following their emphatic win over Pakistan in the semifinal of the ongoing U-19 World Cup.

The Rawalpindi Express said that the Priyam Garg-led side was absolutely brilliant in their performance and that the future of Indian cricket is in safe hands.

“Congratulations to the Pakistan U19 team for reaching the semis. It was a good effort but not good enough to take you to the finals. It was a pathetic fielding performance by Pakistan. Despite being U19, can’t you put in dives while fielding? They did not deserve to be in the finals but on the other end congratulations to India for winning the semis,” Akhtar said in a video posted on his Youtube channel.

“They won it and won it comprehensively. Indian team deserves praise and they must be told that there are some players in your team who will surely represent India in the future. I am very happy to see that India’s future is in the right hands,” he added.

The former Pakistan speedster reserved rich praise for Jaiswal, who has battled all odds to make his way into the Indian set-up and is now one of the rising stars in the country.

“India’s boy Jaiswal, he left his village to come to Mumbai and used to sleep in milk dairies. He has scored two centuries in U19 cricket. Jaiswal used to sell pani-puri in the morning. He sold pani puris to his teammates to have food on his plate.

“Imagine this kind of a guy, who will be street smart and will fight for his place. Rajasthan Royals bought Jaiswal and remember my words that Jaiswal is going to go places. He has the power, passion and interest for the game. He will represent the senior team, this is a guarantee. Saxena also played well.

“Pakistan players need to learn from Jaiswal’s history.

188,06-2-20,Shreyas attributes No 4 success to India A stint,"Shreyas Iyer now owns the No 4 slot in white ball cricket but the success has come owing to his flexible batting positions between Nos 3 to 5 for the India A team, where he learnt the art of tackling various match situations.

With six half-centuries and a hundred with an average of 48 plus in 16 ODIs, Iyer has had a good time in the Indian middle-order.

“In India A, it’s not that I have to bat number four all the time. You keep changing your position depending on what is the situation. I got to manoeuvre my place from 3 to 5, I kept changing (batting order). It’s just that we get good practice there and you face different opposition as well so you get used to the atmosphere,” Iyer attributed his new-found success to his stint with A team.

For someone, who had to wait for his opportunity to cement his place in the senior team, the interim duration spent on A tours was important learning curve.

“India A games are always been helpful for me personally because whenever I used to go there, I used to make sure that as many matches I got, I have to make the best use of it and the players and the atmosphere is also amazing. You literally have no pressure,” Iyer said about the team which is mentored by NCA director Rahul Dravid.

“And coming from the top arena (senior) to one level below (A team) doesn’t make you feel that you are completely away from the team but you always see similar faces around you. I really enjoy that atmosphere like I said,” he said.

Iyer scored an eye-catching 103 off 107 balls but Indian bowlers failed to defend a target of 348 with Ross Taylor scoring a match-winning hundred.

“I am very happy but would have been happier if we could have finished the game on a winning note. First of many (centuries) I hope, so I would take this in my stride and try to make sure that next time, I finish on the winning side,” Iyer said at the post-match press conference.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shreyas-attributes-no-4-success-to-india-a-stint.html
189,06-2-20,NZ ODI side can handle pressure better than T20 team: Taylor,"New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor on Wednesday said their ODI side can deal with pressure situations a lot better than the Twenty20 side and that precisely is the reason they could knock down a big target in the series-opener against India.

“It’s always nice to win after a clean sweep in the T20. Obviously new personnel came in and the loss was not a hang up for them. I am sure it must have played on their minds little bit, you are human, and towards the end we lost a couple of wickets,” Taylor said at the post match press conference.

“But at the same time, the last game was our world cup final and a lot of the guys have played in pressure situations. They are a lot more experienced than the T20 side. So that showed, but it is only one game and lots to go in this series. It is nice to get that monkey off the back,” he said.

Taylor said the dimensions of the ground helped out, but the New Zealand batsmen all contributed to the successful chase.

“That’s the tough thing about playing on some of these grounds in New Zealand, not knowing what a par total is at any time. Whether at the MCG, or here or anywhere else, you always give yourself a chance. At the same time if you lose two early wickets it was going to be a tough chase.

“I think there were some great contributions through out the whole order. Even the bowling lineup did well as India looked like they could get 360-370 at one stage. So we just managed to keep it under 350 and it was a psychological mark I guess. The team has to bat well to get that and we did that today,” he said.

“What made that chase easier for us was the left-right combination. We knew there was one short boundary and we could use that to our advantage,” he added.

Taylor said he was determined to finish the game after the tie here during the T20I.

“It’s not about going there and smacking every single ball but playing good shots. Trying to have those big overs every now and then, soaking up when they did bowl well. They put us under a lot of pressure and obviously when you have worldclass line up like Bumrah and Kuldeep, you respect that and take into consideration when attacking different bowlers. Some days it comes off, like today, and some days it doesn’t,” he said.

“Today Shami bowled exactly the same ball and I inside edged down to fine leg or the keeper. Small margins, it could have been two different results but that is cricket. I guess that’s why we love the game. Just little things — it went our way today and didn’t in the T20s,"" he signed off.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/nz-odi-side-can-handle-pressure-better-than-t20-team--taylor.html
190,06-2-20,Latham’s innings took away momentum: Kohli,"Ross Taylor got the hundred but India captain Virat Kohli said it was Tom Latham’s 48-ball 69 that took away the momentum from his side in the high-scoring first ODI.

“It was an outstanding performance by New Zealand. We thought 348 was good enough. Ross is the experienced batsman they have but Tom’s innings was the one that took away the momentum. Credit to Taylor and Tom,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

India were below-par on the field with Kuldeep Yadav dropping a skier and bowlers doing a less than commendable job.

“Look, we didn’t grab onto one chance, but we were decent. Something we need to keep (on) improving. We can’t focus too much (on negative things). Today, the opposition played better than us and they deserved to win,” Kohli said.

The Indian captain also seemed satisfied with the performance by debutants Mayank Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw, who gave the team a 50-plus start even though they failed to get big scores.

“I think the debutants gave us a good start and hopefully they continue. (Shreyas) Iyer was outstanding getting his first ODI hundred under pressure, KL (Rahul) again. These are positives for us.”

Partnerships key to success

Meanwhile Black Caps Stand-in skipper Tom Latham says building partnership and holding their nerves in the crucial moments helped New Zealand cross the finish line.

“Great performance from the guys. It was nice to keep our composure at the end and get across the line,” stand-in skipper said.

“For us it was about building partnerships. The total was a little more than what we would have liked to chase. But we managed to get off to a good start and keep wickets in hand.

“We saw how hard it was to defend with the left-right combination. It’s nice to make winning contributions. The way Ross played was fantastic.”

India posted a huge 347 and Latham said his team will look to find their “perfect” game in the second ODI.

“We weren’t quite where we wanted to be with the ball. So we got to improve and hopefully we will play the perfect game at Eden Park.”

Taylor, who was adjudged the Man of the Match for anchoring the chase, said the right-left combination and short boundaries helped New Zealand chased overhaul the total.

“It has been an interesting summer, so as to speak, good to get across the line. To restrict them under 350, gave us a chance. We were fortunate with the right-left combination and we targeted the short boundary. Tom came in and released the pressure of me,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/latham---s-innings-took-away-momentum--kohli.html

192,06-2-20,A more colourful picture,"Top films were more diverse than ever before, finds study

Hollywood’s awards season may not show it, but the most popular films are increasingly diverse, a new study finds. According to a new research by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, more of 2019’s top films featured minority or female lead characters than ever recorded before.

Analysing the top 100 films at the North American box office, USC researchers found that 31 films had leads or co-leads from an underrepresented racial group, an increase of four films from 2018 and nearly triple the number of 10 years ago. The data showed similar gains for female leads. Of the same films, 43 featured female leads or co-leads, an increase of four films from 2018 and more than double the number of female leads (20) in 2007.

Combined with studies released last month that showed a notable uptick in the numbers of female directors, the research paints a picture of an industry that, after years of lagging behind in representation in front of and behind the camera, is showing real signs of progress. While still falling short of an accurate reflection of the American population (51 per cent of which is female and about 40 per cent are people of colour), researchers called it “a banner year for inclusion.” “It is clear that Hollywood is taking steps to create more inclusive stories and that those films are connecting with audience,” Stacy L Smith, founder of the Inclusion Initiative, said in statement.

But those gains haven’t been reflected in Hollywood’s awards season, which culminates Sunday with the Academy Awards. For the 87th time, no female filmmakers were nominated for best director. And while the much-nominated Korean drama Parasite has made history, only one person of colour (Cynthia Erivo, for Harriet) was nominated in an acting category. At the British Academy of Film and Television Awards on Sunday, only white actors were nominated.

“There is also a very obvious disconnect between what sells tickets and what garners awards points to a systemic bias at cultural institutions like the BAFTAs or the Academy Awards,” Smith said. “After another year in which the major studios increased their output of films with female and underrepresented leads or co leads, it is critical to recognise that talent is not limited by gender or race/ethnicity.”

The USC study also assessed the major distributors. Because box office is a key metric in their research, that doesn’t include releases from streaming services including Netflix and Amazon, neither of which disclosed ticket sales for most of their 2019 releases.

Universal, the only studio led by a woman (studio chief Donna Langley), led all studios with nine films featuring a female lead and eight films featuring leads from an underrepresented ethnicity.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-more-colourful-picture-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-more-colourful-picture.html

194,06-2-20,A new port at Vadhavan,"The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has given its 'in-principle’ approval for setting up a major port at Vadhavan near Dahanu in Maharashtra. Total cost of the project is likely to be Rs 65,544.54 crore.

Vadhavan port will be developed on ‘land lord model’. A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) will be formed with Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) as the lead partner with equity participation equal to or more than 50 per cent to implement the project. The SPV will develop the port infrastructure including reclamation, construction of breakwater, besides establishing connectivity to the hinterland. All the business activities would be undertaken under PPP mode by private developers.

The position of JN Port, the biggest container port in India is 28th in the world with a traffic of 5.1 million TEUs (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units). Even after the completion of the 4th terminal at JN Port with a capacity increase of 10 million TEUs by 2023, it will stand as the 17th largest container port in the world. With the development of Vadhavan port, India will reach in the list of top 10 container ports in the world.

Maharashtra has India’s largest container port at JNPT, which caters to the hinterland of Maharashtra, North Karnataka, Telangana and secondary hinterland of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, NCR, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. There is a need for a deep draft port that will accommodate the largest container ships in the world and also cater to the spill over traffic from JNPT port. JNPT and Mundra, the two largest container handling ports of the country (for mid size container ships only), have drafts of 15 m and 16 m respectively, while the world’s largest container handling modern deep draft ports require a draft of 18 m to 20 m.

The Vadhavan port has a natural draft of about 20 metres close to the shore, making it possible for it to handle bigger vessels. Development of Vadhavan port will enable call of container vessels of 16,000 to 25,000 TEUs capacity, giving advantages of economies of scale and reducing logistics cost.

The ever increasing size of container ships makes it imperative that a deep draft container port in West Coast of India is developed. Increasing containerisation of cargo in the wake of value-added manufacturing sector makes it important to prepare our port infrastructure for handling value-added import and export to facilitate manufacturing activity. Container traffic in the JNPT hinterland is expected to grow from 4.5 MTEUs currently to 10.1 MTEUs by 2022 to 25 when JNPT’s potential will be fully exhausted. The demand for container traffic will further accelerate after the plans for improving logistic infrastructure fructify and the ‘Make in India’ push drives greater exports and manufacture sourcing to India.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-new-port-at-vadhavan.html

197,06-2-20,"Student, an invaluable treasure","There is one Vidur Neeti shloka that one should preach when s/he wishes to get education. “The student, who is desirous of experiencing worldly merriment, should leave vidya (study), for he who is desirous of attaining vidya, he never thinks about experiencing worldly merriment.”

The meaning of the term, vidya is the voice that gives knowledge. The aspirant who ardently desires to gain knowledge is called vidyarthi or student. Obtaining traditional knowledge brings attention to previous Vedic Yugas, where Brahma (follower of four Vedas) used to preach different types of moral duties and spiritual knowledge from in a yajyen. As per a Rigved mantra, such preaching is called vidya, which is divine knowledge that gives salvation, if we follow it.

When we run more towards worldly merriment and materialistic articles, it is called avidya. And please note, that in present times, only avidya is being preached everywhere and hence, is a huge problem. A deep study of Vedas reveals that both vidya and avidya are necessary for human life and survival.

That is why, a Yajurved mantra states that a person, who knows and follows vidya, realises god. When he follows avidya, he overcomes the fear of death. Therefore, the two are required to be known and progressed simultaneously, being the main motto of life.

Nowadays, students are told that education is the means to earn money, survive and to live upon, which is making the current education one-sided and more related to worldly matters only.

As compared to the kind of education provided in the ancient times, when kings and queens had ruled, the present education system is very one-sided. With such practices, not only the students but even the government is living in an illusionistic world, away from spirituality. And students, being the invaluable treasure of the nation, are highly affected by illusion. It consequently leads to violence, corruption, dishonour to women, malnutrition and several other problems in the country (Atharvaveda mantra).

Hence, a necessary amendment in the education system is the need of the hour. The system should find its roots to traditional education as well.

In view of the above facts, four Vedas preach that youngsters should concentrate on studies and in the meanwhile, discharge all moral duties. The students must always keep themselves away from all kinds of violence, riots and other controversy.

A Manusmriti shloka preaches that holding the same knowledge in life, which is mentioned in Vedas and smritis is the best authentic moral righteousness. And therefore, the deeds done against the vedas and smritis are completely sinful. As was facilitated by Kings in the ancient yugas, our government also need to make necessary arrangements and include Vedic literature in present academic syllabuses to keep the tradition alive for generations to come.

Nowadays, when we eulogise the true stories of Ram, Krishna, king Janak, king Harishchandra and Dashrath, we usually forget that such pious dignitaries received the eternal knowledge of Vedas from ancient rishis traditionally. The said people set an example that to receive such Vedic knowledge and preach it in daily life, is the motto of human life. Hence, it is regretful that India has broken the tradition of listening and attaining Vedic knowledge by students from a learned acharya or guru or teacher.

In this regard, a Rigved mantra here preaches to assume that soul is telling his body that, ‘Oh friend! We must destroy the sorrows and obstacles which come in our life by receiving Vedic knowledge and science and philosophy, thus obtain salvation.’

It is sad that the present education system is totally against the ancient gurukul system of learning. It is devoid of the code of ethics that were taught in the ancient times. The person who misconducts in life cannot be purified by even practicing the Vedas. So the government should pay utmost attention to generate Vedic values and morality in all students and fulfill their reasonable demands to make the nation strong.

Students are priceless gems who can lead the country to progress. Therefore, virtuous conduct, moral duties, ethical behaviour, good character with control over senses, kindness, nationality and religious thoughts, etc.. are some of the good qualities which the youth needs to instill in themselves. Each and every Indian student need to understand his/her duties and help other people too to follow them. Well, most of it rests on parents and the government too.

198,06-2-20,India can offer IT and medical solutions: Ecuadorian diplomat,"India has capacity to offer potential solutions for the issues bothering Ecuador,” said Hector Cueva Jacome. The Ambassador of Ecuador to India was addressing the gathering at World Cancer Day celebration at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. Best technology comes from India. It is easily adaptable, affordable and accessible for any country in the world.

Jacome said, “Effective solutions can come from India in the area of battling cancer.” Indian professionals and technology can be of good use to them to raise awareness with an objective of preventing cancer and also finding effective treatment solutions to it. “Cancer can become a disaster if nothing is done to prevent it,” he said.

“Ecuador can prevent, treat breast and prostrate cancers with the technological and professional help that pours from India. These cancers are common in their nation, however, not many go to seek help to treat the disease due to financial and social issues. These ailments are totally preventable,” added the ambassador.

The solutions found in India are cost-effective. “Glenza, the medicine used for prostrate cancer costs about 4,500 dollars per month in their country, while in India it is available for only 700 dollars per month as per their currency. The cost of using mammography is about 200 dollars in their nation. We have the needs and you (India) have the solutions. We just need to build a bridge to enable the solutions to reach us,” he said.

Vice chancellor of SRMIST, Sandeep Sancheti, said, “World Cancer Day ensures that we are raising awareness on the dreaded disease only to come out of its clutches. If it is not controlled, it will spread like wild fire. We need to use the best of the technology, medication in treating cancer.”

Dean of SRM Dental College, Dr N Vivek, said that nearly 80 per cent of the population in the developing nation will likely suffer from cancer by 2040. However, these numbers can be brought down by being instrumental in prevention. “We all can be instrumental in fighting against factors like tobacco, which are highly responsible for causing the problem,” he said. A video clip on cancer prevention was also screened.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-can-offer-it-and-medical-solutions--ecuadorian-diplomat-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/india-can-offer-it-and-medical-solutions--ecuadorian-diplomat.html

200,06-2-20,SC begins hearing to decide if it can refer question of law to larger bench in review jurisdiction,"A nine-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court Thursday began deliberations on the legal issue of whether the top court can refer questions of law to a larger bench while exercising its review jurisdiction.

This question arose during the hearing in the Sabarimala case which relates to gender discrimination against women at religious places.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde is hearing the issues relating to discriminations against women at various places of worship including the Sabarimala temple.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta argued that the apex court was right in referring the questions of law to the larger bench and added, ""as custodian of fundamental rights, it was the duty of the court to lay down an authoritative pronouncement on these questions of law"".

""Your Lordships are duty bound as custodians for posterity. Issues regarding review, reference, curative, these cannot be gone into. If there is a question of law, the court has the liberty to constitute a larger bench to settle the issues,"" Mehta said.

The other members of the bench are Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, M M Shantanagoudar, S A Nazeer, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant.

Many senior lawyers including Fali S Nariman, Kapil Sibal, Shyam Divan, Rajeev Dhavan and Rakesh Dwivedi argued on February 3 that while exercising review jurisdiction, the Supreme Court does not have the power to refer a question of law to a larger bench.

They said last year's November 14 verdict of a five-judge bench, headed by the then CJI Justice Rajan Gogoi, was wrong in making a reference of broad contours while deciding the review petition against the 2018 judgement which allowed women of all age groups to enter Kerala's Sabarimala temple.

Besides Sabarimala, last year's verdict had also referred issues of entry of Muslim women into mosques and dargahs and of Parsi women, married to non-Parsi men, being barred from the holy fire place of an agyari, to the larger bench.

The senior lawyers had assailed as ""erroneous"" the reference made to a larger bench by the five-judge bench on questions related to gender discrimination against women in religious places while dealing with the Sabarimala case.

The top court had said it will frame the legal issues to be adjudicated by a nine-judge Constitution bench on religious discrimination against women at various religious places.

The Constitution bench said it will inform the parties about the time frame for the hearing and would commence the proceedings by next week.

The apex court had said that as of now it would go by the reference order of November 14 last year, made by a five-judge bench.

By a 3:2 majority, it said the larger bench will have to evolve a judicial policy to do ""substantial and complete justice"" in matters of freedom of religion, such as restrictions on the entry of Muslim and Parsi women into their respective places of worship.

It had taken note of vehement opposition by the senior lawyers who claimed that the apex court was wrong in making a reference of broad contours while deciding the review petition against the 2018 verdict.

The top court had said it would deal with the legal issue, raised by the senior lawyers, of whether a reference order can be made in review jurisdiction for a hearing by a larger bench.

Sibal, appearing for the All Indian Muslim Personal Board (AIMPLB), had said though the Board has clarified that Muslim women are allowed to enter mosques to offer Namaz, the court should not enter into matters of faith and decide essential religious practices while entertaining a PIL filed by a person not belonging to a particular faith.

Mehta had referred to the Supreme Court Rules and said the court can undertake a larger debate ""on the contours of Articles 25, 26 (fundamental right to religion)"".

Mehta, senior advocates K Parasaran and Ranjit Kumar had said the top court while exercising the review jurisdiction can refer a larger issue, which has arisen during the adjudication of the dispute, to a larger bench.

A five-judge bench, by a majority of 3:2 on November 14 last year, had referred to a larger bench the issue of discrimination against women at various religions' places of worship.

A majority verdict by the then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices A M Khanwilkar and Indu Malhotra decided to keep the pleas seeking a review of its decision regarding entry of women into the shrine pending and said restrictions on women at religious places were not limited to Sabarimala alone and were prevalent in other religions also.

By a 4:1 majority verdict, the apex court had lifted the ban that prevented women and girls between the age of 10 and 50 years from entering the famous Ayyappa shrine in Sabarimala and held that the centuries-old Hindu religious practice was illegal and unconstitutional.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-begins-hearing-to-decide-if-it-can-refer-question-of-law-to-larger-bench-in-review-jurisdiction-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-begins-hearing-to-decide-if-it-can-refer-question-of-law-to-larger-bench-in-review-jurisdiction.html

The then disqualified Congress-JDS MLAs who had shifted loyalty to the BJP and won the December by-elections, were sworn-in at a simple ceremony at Raj Bhavan with the Governor Vajubhai Vala admistering oath of office and secrecy.

The ten are S T Somashekar (Yeshwantpur constituency), Ramesh Jarkiholi (Gokak), Anand Singh (Vijayanagar), K Sudhakar (Chickballapur), Byrathi Basavaraj (K R Puram), A Shivaram Hebbar (Yellapur), B C Patil (Hirekerur), K Gopalaiah (Mahalakshmi Layout), K C Narayana Gowda (K R Pet) and Shrimant Balasaheb Patil (Kagwad).

The much-awaited expansion takes the strength of the Cabinet to 28, with six vacancies now.

In the first expansion last August, 17 Ministers were inducted.

The latest exercise wasn't without a twist.

Yediyurappa had announced on Sunday that 13 aspirants, including the ten who were sworn-in on Thursday and three BJP old-timers would be inducted.

The three who were expected to get Cabinet berth were Umesh Katti, Arvind Limbavali and C P Yogeshwar.

A section of the BJP had opposed making Yogeshwar a Minister, pointing out that he had lost Assembly elections and not a member of either House.

Late on Wednesday, Yediyurappa said induction of BJP old-timers had been put off following directions from the party's central leadership.

The decision to take none of the ""native"" BJP leaders into the Cabinet in the current round came after intense lobbying from several aspirants which threatened to go out of hand at one stage, party sources said.

The 10 newly inducted Ministers were among the then 16 Congress-JDS MLAs who brought down the coalition government headed by H D Kumaraswamy.

Among these disqualified MLAs, 13 had contested the by- polls in December and 11 had won.

203,06-2-20,Sena slams BJP over Ram temple trust announcement before Delhi Polls,"A day after the Centre announced formation of a trust to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Shiv Sena lashed out at the BJP, saying the issue was not expected to be politicised, but its ""foundation"" has been laid ahead of the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls.

Elections to the 70-member Delhi Assembly will be held on Saturday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday announced in the Lok Sabha formation of a 15-member autonomous trust to construct the temple at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh.

""Modi gave the slogan of 'Jai Shri Ram' just four days ahead of polling for the Delhi Assembly. Will be happy if (the number) goes up by two-four seats with the help of Shri Ram,"" an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' on Thursday said sarcastically.

""It was expected that the issue of Ram temple will not be politicised, but its 'foundation' was laid for the Delhi Assembly (election) and will be completed on the occasion of 2024 Lok Sabha (polls),"" it said in cryptic remarks.

It is expected that a ""Ram Rajya"" (welfare state) will be realised in a true sense in the country by then, it added.

There is criticism that the BJP ""brought in"" Lord Ram as Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal has caused restlessness in the saffron party ahead of the Delhi Assembly polls, the Marathi daily said.

""This (criticism) is because the prime minister announced formation of the temple trust four days ahead of polling. It is important that the prime minister made the announcement in the Lok Sabha,"" it said.

The Shiv Sena said the Supreme Court will have to be thanked first for the prime minister's announcement about the trust, as the apex court had ordered construction of the temple in November last year.

It also thanked Modi for discharging his duty as the prime minister in the light of the Supreme Court order.

The Shiv Sena, which had long campaigned for the temple construction, said how autonomous the trust is going to be will be known only after the appointment of its members.

It said the trust should have representation of all the organisations which campaigned for the temple construction, if it is an ""autonomous body"".

The Uddhav Thackeray-led party said it was active in the campaign for temple construction from day one.

""The BJP itself had then admitted that the Shiv Sainiks landed hammers on the Babri (mosque) and the (then) Shiv Sena chief (late Bal Thackeray) said he was proud of the Shiv Sainiks who brought down the Babri,"" it pointed out.

Hundreds of Shiv Sainiks ""laid their lives"" in the violence after the Babri mosque demolition, it claimed.

""Those who gave the slogan of 'Jai Shri Ram' should keep this in mind,"" it said.

Recalling L K Advani's role in the campaign, the Shiv Sena said the BJP would not have attained the current position in country's politics had the veteran leader not taken out a 'rath yatra' in the name of Shri Ram (in 1990).

The construction of Ram temple had been part of the BJP's poll manifesto for years, and it was expected that the promise would be fulfilled when the Narendra Modi government was formed at the Centre in 2014 will full majority, it said.

During the previous term of Modi government, the Shiv Sena - a partner of the BJP till last year - called for bringing an ordinance for temple construction, but the government did not do so, the editorial recalled.

""Eventually, hearing took place in the Supreme Court on the Ram temple issue for 40 days in a row and the it gave verdict in favour of the Ram temple (construction)...The trust is being formed due to that court order,"" it said.

""It is binding on any government to implement the courts order. Prime Minister Modi followed that order,"" the Marathi publication added.

While making announcement about the trust on Wednesday, the prime minister also said the government has decided to transfer 67.70 acres of land acquired under the Ayodhya Act to the trust.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sena-slams-bjp-over-ram-temple-trust-announcement-before-delhi-polls-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sena-slams-bjp-over-ram-temple-trust-announcement-before-delhi-polls.html

On food inflation, RBI said it is likely to soften from the high levels registered in December and the decline is expected to become more pronounced during the fourth quarter of this fiscal as onion prices ease following arrivals of late kharif and rabi harvests, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its last bi-monthly monetary policy revealed on Thursday.

Besides, crude prices are likely to remain volatile due to unabated geo-political tensions in the Middle East on one hand, and uncertain global economic outlook on the other.

Moreover, there has been an increase in input costs for services, in recent months, it added.

The RBI has kept the key repo rate unchanged to 5.15 per cent.

""Taking into consideration these factors, and under the assumption of a normal south west monsoon in 2020-21, the CPI inflation projection is revised upwards to 6.5 per cent for Q4:2019-20 (January-March 2020); 5.4-5 per cent for H1:2020-21 (April-September 2020); and 3.2 per cent for Q3:2020-21 (October-December), with risks broadly balanced,"" RBI said.

The recent pick-up in prices of non-vegetable food items, specifically in milk due to a rise in input costs, and pulses due to a shortfall in kharif production, are all likely to sustain, RBI said.

RBI further said that the actual inflation outcome for Q2 at 5.8 per cent overshot projections by 70 bps, primarily due to the intensification of the ""onion price shock"" in December 2019 on account of unseasonal rains in October-November.

In its previous monetary policy in December 2019 as well, the RBI had raised its inflation projection to 5.1-4.7 per cent for the second half of the current fiscal on the back of spike in prices of vegetables such as onion and tomatoes.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rbi-revises-upwards-retail-inflation-projection-to-6-5-pc-for-jan-mar-qtr-of-this-fiscal-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/rbi-revises-upwards-retail-inflation-projection-to-6-5-pc-for-jan-mar-qtr-of-this-fiscal.html
205,06-2-20,"RBI has many other tools to revive growth, not just interest rates: Das","After leaving benchmark interest rates rates unchanged in the second consecutive policy review, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday said the central bank has many other instruments to address the sluggishness the economy, not just interest rates.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its sixth bi-monthly monetary policy pegged GDP growth for FY21 at 6 per cent, but guided towards an uncertain inflation outlook.

In a January 31 release, the National Statistical Office (NSO) had revised down real GDP growth for FY19 to 6.1 per cent from 6.8 per cent provided in the provisional estimates of May 2019. Given this, the central bank noted that the economy is still plagued by deep output gaps.

""The RBI has several instruments to address the sluggishness in the growth momentum,"" Das told reporters at the customary post-policy conference.

The monetary policy committee (MPC) kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 5.15 per cent, continuing with the accommodative stance to revive growth.

The governor said the continuity in policy from last pause should not be read as a pointer to future actions. ""While the decision is as per expectations, it is important not to discount RBI,"" he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rbi-has-many-other-tools-to-revive-growth--not-just-interest-rates--das-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/rbi-has-many-other-tools-to-revive-growth--not-just-interest-rates--das.html
206,06-2-20,No one in BJP worthy of becoming CM of Delhi: Kejriwal,"No one in the BJP is worthy of becoming chief minister of Delhi, AAP supremo and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday, the last day of campaigning before the February 8 assembly elections.

People want to know who will be the Bharatiya Janata Party's chief ministerial candidate, Kejriwal told PTI in an interview, and asked what if the party chooses Sambit Patra or Anurag Thakur for the post.

He said the Bharatiya Janata Party had tried to polarise the assembly polls, and asserted that results will show if it succeeded or not.

""AAP voters are those who want good education, medical treatment, modern roads, 24-hour electricity,"" Kejriwal said.

Discussing the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh, the AAP national convener alleged that the BJP has not cleared the Shaheen Bagh road because of the assembly elections.

""What stopped Union Home Minister Amit Shah from clearing the stretch. What is Amit Shah's interest in keeping the road blocked? Why do they want to trouble the people of Delhi and do dirty politics over the protests?"" Kejriwal asked.

Continuing his attack on the BJP, he added that the saffron party's leaders have ""completely forgotten"" the city's unauthorised colonies and are misleading the people.

""Delhi government's 'free schemes' will continue if AAP voted back to power, we will introduce more schemes if needed,"" said Kejriwal.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-one-in-bjp-worthy-of-becoming-cm-of-delhi--kejriwal-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/no-one-in-bjp-worthy-of-becoming-cm-of-delhi--kejriwal.html
207,06-2-20,Taylor stitches triumph,"Kiwis break duck of defeats as Ross’ ton takes host past finish line

After coming close on three occasions to beat India in the ongoing tour, New Zealand were finally able to cross the line and taste victory as they defeated the Men in Blue by four wickets in the first ODI at the Seddon Park on Wednesday.

Seasoned campaigner Ross Taylor anchored New Zealand’s chase of 348 by scoring a brilliant hundred. He was well supported by Henry Nicholls and stand-in captain Tom Latham as the hosts took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.

The Black Caps started off the chase on a cautious note as both Martin Guptill and Nicholls played with intent. Such was the determination from Guptill (32) that he scored just two boundaries in 41 balls before getting out to Shardul Thakur on the team score of 85.

Debutant Tom Blundell, who came in first down, didn’t have a great outing and was stumped by KL Rahul at his individual score of 9. At that point of time, the match appeared to be heading in India’s favour.

However, it was then that Taylor brought in all his experience and alongwith Nicholls shared a 62-run stand. After Nicholls’ dismissal who was sent back to the pavilion courtesy some brilliant fielding efforts from Virat Kohli, Latham joined forces with Taylor and steered the team towards victory.

The match did seem to once again turn towards India as New Zealand lost two wickets in quick succession and brought the crowd to the edge of the seats.

However Mitchell Santner smashed two boundaries in Thakur’s 48th over and erased hopes of any upset.

Taylor — who scored his 21st ODI century — collected the winning runs as he remained unbeaten on 109 alongside Santner who scored 12 not out and guided New Zealand to what is their most famous win in recent times.

Earlier, India rode on a brilliant century from Shreyas Iyer and fifties from Rahul and Kohli as they posted a formidable 348-run target. After being put into bat, debutants Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal provided India with a steady start. They initially faced some tough time, but managed to get through that and stitched a 50-run stand.

However, both failed to capitalise on their starts as they got out in successive overs. While Shaw (20) was the first to go as he got a peach of a delivery from Colin de Grandhomme, Agarwal tried to be over aggressive and in the process gifted his wicket to Tim Southee after contributing with 32.

Skipper Kohli then stitched a 102-run stand with Iyer and steadied India’s ship. The Indian captain looked all set to score yet another century but was undone by a brilliant googly from Ish Sodhi and was bowled after scoring 51.

Rahul, who has been in the form of his life on the ongoing tour, continued from where he left in the T20Is, and made sure runs come thick and fast for the visitors. He shared a 136-run partnership with Iyer before the latter got out after playing a brilliant knock of 103.

However, the dismissal didn’t deter the confidence of Rahul who continued with his prolific form and switched gears to take India past the 300-run mark. He was well supported by Kedar Jadhav, who played a nice cameo and took the New Zealand bowlers to the cleaners.

The duo added 55 runs off 27 balls as India finished at 347/4 in their allotted quota of 50 overs. While Rahul remained unbeaten on 88 (64 balls), Jadhav scored 26 runs in 15 balls.

The two teams will now face off in the second ODI at the Eden Park on Saturday.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/taylor-stitches-triumph-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/taylor-stitches-triumph.html
208,06-2-20,Barcelona coach refuses to get,"Barcelona coach Quique Setien said he would not get involved in ""Lionel Messi's life"" after the Argentine superstar became entangled in a row with the club's sporting director Eric Abidal.

Messi hit back at Abidal on Tuesday after the Frenchman had earlier blamed slackness in the dressing room for the departure of recently-fired boss Ernesto Valverde.

In an interview with Spanish newspaper Sport, Abidal said under Valverde, who was fired in mid-January, many players had been unhappy, had not worked hard enough and had not communicated properly.

""I'm not going to get into Messi's life, or anyone's life,"" said Setien, who replaced Valverde.

""What interests me is football, everything else are situations that I will not be able to control, therefore I do not sweat on it,"" the 61-year-old added.

Setien denied he had spoken individually to the Argentina star about the incident but said it had been briefly discussed in a training session by the squad.

Messi signed his last contract extension in 2017, with his current deal running through to next year but reportedly containing a clause that could allow him to quit Barcelona in June.

Former Real Betis boss Setien said Messi's behaviour remained the same despite the falling out with Abidal.

""I have seen him smiling, I have seen him looking happy, he loves to come to training, he loves to be here and I have seen him just like he was yesterday or the day before yesterday,"" Setien said.

Setien said his only focus was Thursday's Copa del Rey quarter-final tie at Athletic Bilbao.

""The importance of tomorrow's match, the obligation we have is to focus totally and absolutely on the match,"" Setien said.

Spanish media reported later on Wednesday, citing sources close to the club, that Abidal had met with Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu who would no longer consider, as speculated beforehand, to demand the Frenchman's resignation.

Messi on Tuesday criticised Abidal's comments, saying that his former teammate should ""name names"".

""Sincerely I don't like doing this kind of thing but everyone has to be made responsible for their actions and what they say,"" Messi said on Instagram.

""We the players in the dressing room are the first to admit it when we haven't played well. The directors need to take their responsibilities too.

""I believe that if you talk about the players (in this way) you should name names instead of worrying everyone and encouraging rumours that are far from certain.""

The Raptors faced the Awadhe Warriors in a must-win tie with both the teams contending for the last semi-final spot to join the North Eastern Warriors, Chennai Superstarz and Pune 7 Aces.

With the Raptors being on the fourth spot in the league table and separated from the Awadhe team by three points, they needed to ensure that the Warriors don’t manage to get four points. Even though the Lucknow-based franchise began the highly-awaited tie with a win in men’s doubles, Brice Leverdez beat the Awadhe Trump Ajay Jayaram to turn the tie on its head and then Tai Tzu Ying fetched another vital point to take the Raptors into the last-four.

The face-off between the former World No 1 Tai Tzu Ying and World No 14 Beiwen Zhang was obviously the cynosure of all eyes. Zhang trails the Chinese Taipei ace 2-8 in their head-to-head record on the BWF World Tour but she put in a show on the court that oozed brilliance and determination to win15-12, 15-12.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tai-takes-raptors-into-pbl-semis.html
210,06-2-20,Shaheen Bagh shooter admitted during probe he had joined AAP: Ranjan,"Special Commissioner of Police (Intelligence) Praveer Ranjan on Wednesday said Kapil Baisala who opened fired at the Shaheen Bagh protest site had ""admitted during investigation"" that he had joined AAP last year.

Addressing a press conference here, he said the pictures purportedly showing him joining the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were in the ""public domain"" and found during the probe.

""Shaheen Bagh shooter Kapil during police investigation had admitted that he and his father had taken the primary membership of AAP in May 2019,"" he claimed.

""Anyway, further investigation is on in the case,"" Ranjan told reporters in response to queries about police mentioning the name of the party with which Baisala has alleged links.

However, Baisala's father Gaje Singh has refuted the police version, claiming his son has no association with AAP.

He added that Baisala doesn't have friends associated with AAP or any other political party.

Singh, a resident of Dallupura village here, said he was a member of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) but left politics after losing the 2012 municipal polls here.

Meanwhile, taking a strong view of Delhi Police DCP Rajesh Deo sharing with the media investigation details that linked Baisala to AAP, the Election Commission on Wednesday said his statement was ""totally uncalled for"" and barred him from election duty.

The EC said Deo's conduct has ""consequences"" on holding ""free and fair elections"".

The police officer said they hed seized Baisala's mobile phone and retrieved WhatsApp data.

Deo on Tuesday had said that Baisala and his father had joined AAP in early 2019.

Kapil Baisala's uncle Fatesh Singh told PTI on Tuesday, ""I have no idea where these photographs are circulating from. My nephew Kapil had no association with any political party nor does any other member from the family. My brother, Gaje Singh, (Baisala's father) fought assembly elections in 2008 on a Bahujan Samaj Party ticket and lost. After that no one from our family had any links with any political party.""",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaheen-bagh-shooter-admitted-during-probe-he-had-joined-aap--ranjan-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/shaheen-bagh-shooter-admitted-during-probe-he-had-joined-aap--ranjan.html
211,06-2-20,Train services affected on Blue Line due to OHE wire issue,"Services were affected for nearly an hour on the Blue Line on Wednesday due to an issue in the overhead electric (OHE) wire on a section of the corridor, officials said.

The Blue Line connects Dwarka in Delhi to Electronic City in Noida.

""Train services on Line-3/4(Blue Line) were regulated from 3-4 pm today between Karol Bagh and Indraprashta section. This was necessitated to undertake the repair of some broken strands of OHE wire between Rajiv Chowk and R K Ashram Metro section (Up Line-going towards Dwarka) which are suspected to be broken due to some foreign material falling on OHE,"" the DMRC said in a statement.

The exact reason shall be worked out during the night after completion of train services, it said.

Due to the OHE issue, trains were moved in the affected portion with a restricted speed of 5 kmph to avoid damage to the pantographs of the trains, resulting in delay in services, officials said.

""To avoid impact on the entire Blue Line, train movement was regulated intermittently through loops also, between Karol Bagh abd Dwarka -21 section, and Indraprastha to Noida/Vaishali section,"" the statement said.

212,06-2-20,All five polling stations in Shaheen Bagh put under 'critical category': Delhi CEO,"In view of the ongoing anti-CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh, the Delhi poll body has put all five polling stations in the area under the ""critical"" category, a top official said on Wednesday, while asserting that confidence-building measures are being undertaken to reassure voters.

Addressing a press conference here, Delhi Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh said the area is under ""tight vigil"" and ""there is no obstruction"" in areas where poll activities will be conducted, so voters will face no problems.

Singh, accompanied by the district election officer and nodal police officers, had visited Shaheen Bagh area on Friday to assess the situation and preparedness ahead of the February 8 Delhi Assembly election.

""In view of the ongoing protests in Shaheen Bagh, we have declared all five polling stations in the area as critical polling stations. There are about 40 booths encompassing those five stations. All these booths are therefore under critical category,"" Singh told reporters on Wednesday.

Besides police security, polling stations falling in the ""critical category"" get paramilitary cover. Activities will be monitored through webcasting, he said.

Police and election machinery are on ""extra vigil"" and assessing the situation all the time across the national capital, he added.

Shaheen Bagh falls in the Okhla assembly constituency. The area has become the epicentre of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the national capital and the agitation has been thrusted by political parties into a poll issue.

Hundreds of people, including women and children, have been protesting since December 15 at Shaheen Bagh against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens.

The protesters have blockaded a busy thoroughfare in south Delhi and have been demanding that the CAA be repealed.

Polls for the 70-member Delhi Assembly will be held on February 8. The counting of votes will be taken up on February 11.

Singh said security personnel carry out marches and patrolling in the area to boost confidence of voters and ""I see no reason to worry"".

""During my visit on Friday, the pulse I got from the local people was that there is no fear in their minds and the ongoing issue and the protests have not affected their psyche. We are quite hopeful that voters in the area will come out and exercise their franchise without any fear,"" he said.

The Delhi CEO also said that no complaint has been received from local people of Shaheen Bagh about any safety issue for the polling day.

There are 13,750 polling booths, besides one auxiliary booth, located at 2,689 locations across Delhi.

Singh said 1,47,86,382 people are eligible to vote in the Delhi polls, including 2,32,815 in age group of 18 to 19.

""As far as critical polling stations are concerned, there are 516 locations and 3,704 booths in that category,"" he said.

Special Commissioner of Police (Intelligence) Praveer Ranjan, on the sidelines of the press conference, said 190 companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) will be deployed as part of the security measures.

This is nearly four times the number of CAPF personnel deployed during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, he added.

On the FIRs filed against political parties under the model code of conduct (MCC) norms and the Delhi Defacement Act, Singh said 30 FIRs have been filed against the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) -- three under MCC category and rest under the Delhi Defacement Act.

Four FIRs have been filed against the BJP under the Delhi Defacement Act and one under the MCC category, while for the Congress it is one for MCC violation and eight for defacement, he added.

Officials said 27 proposals were received for holding programmes or other events, out of which 16 were approved by the Election Commission and nine by the CEO.

For video vans, 191 applications were received and 185 granted and six rejected, Singh said.

Media Certification and Monitoring Committee (MCMC) Cell has received 217 applications so far, out of which 188 certificates have been issued, six applications are pending and 23 rejected for amendment, he said.

213,06-2-20,Nirbhaya case: SC to hear on Friday Centre's appeal challenging HC verdict on hanging of convicts,"The Supreme Court has agreed to hear on Friday the Centre's appeal challenging the Delhi High Court's verdict dismissing its plea against stay on the execution of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.

Additional Solicitor General K M Natraj, appearing for the Centre, on Thursday mentioned the matter for urgent listing before a bench comprising Justices N V Ramana, Sanjiv Khanna and Krishna Murari.

Natraj told the court that jail authorities are unable to execute the convicts in the case despite the fact that their review petitions have been dismissed and curative petitions and mercy pleas of three of them have been rejected.

The Delhi High Court Wednesday held that all the four convicts are to be executed together and not separately while setting a week's deadline for them to avail the remaining remedies.

If the convicts choose not to make any type of petition in seven days from now, the institutions/ authorities concerned will deal with the matter, as per the law, without further delay, it said.

Hours after the high court's verdict, the Centre filed an appeal against it in the apex court.

The high court said all the four convicts in the Nirbhaya case have to be executed together, not separately, and faulted the authorities concerned for not taking steps for issuance of death warrants after rejection of appeals of the convicts by the Supreme Court in 2017.

The trial court had on January 31 stayed ""till further orders"" execution of the four convicts in the case -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31), who are lodged in Tihar Jail.

A lawyer associated with the matter had said the grounds taken for challenge in the top court are almost the same as taken in the high court while filing the appeal against the trial court order.

He had said the Centre has stated in the petition in the apex court that the convicts can be hanged separately as Mukesh has exhausted all his remedies, including the mercy plea.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-case--sc-to-hear-on-friday-centre-s-appeal-challenging-hc-verdict-on-hanging-of-convicts-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nirbhaya-case--sc-to-hear-on-friday-centre-s-appeal-challenging-hc-verdict-on-hanging-of-convicts.html
214,06-2-20,NDA govt's determination solved many problems: Modi,"Amid anti-CAA protests in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday accused the Congress and the Left of inciting people at protest sites while making it clear that the Act will neither impact any Indian citizen nor harm minority interests.

Replying to a debate on Motion of Thanks to the President's Address in Lok Sabha, Modi also attacked the Congress for its politics in the last seven decades, saying the party's politics of last 70 years has been such that no Congress leader can be self-sufficient.

""I want to clearly state that with the CAA coming, there will be no impact on any citizen of India, practising any faith. CAA does not affect any Indian, it doesn't harm minority interests,"" he said in his more than 90-minute long reply.

The motion was later passed by the voice vote.

The prime minister said much has been said about the CAA, ironically by those who love getting photographed with the group of people who want 'Tukde Tukde of India.

""Those who have been removed from office by the people of India are now doing the unthinkable. They see citizens on the basis of their faith. We are different. We see everyone as an Indian,"" he said.

Attacking the Congress, Modi said a person who was associated with the 1984 anti-Sikh riots was made as chief minister.

""Does a party that keeps talking about secularism not remember 1984 and the anti-Sikh violence. It was shameful. In addition, they did not make efforts to punish the guilty,"" he said.

Defending the CAA, the prime minister said the Congress is having problems when ""our govt is taking decisions on wishes of the country's founding fathers"".

Slamming former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah for their remarks on abrogation of Article 370, Modi said Kashmir's identity was buried on January 19, 1990, when Kashmiri Pandits started leaving the Valley due to militancy.

""Who made Kashmir only about land grabbing? Who made Kashmir's identity only about bombs and guns? Can anyone forget that dark night of January? In reality, Kashmiri identity is closely linked with harmony,"" he said.

Elaborating on his government's achievements, the prime minister said the people of the country have seen his government's work between 2014 and 2019 and gave a bigger mandate in 2019.

""The people of India saw our work for five years. They once again blessed us, so that we work even faster,"" he said.

Modi said India can no longer wait for problems to remain unsolved, and, rightfully so. ""That is why, our aim is speed and scale, determination and decisiveness, sensitivity and solutions"".

""The people of India have not only changed the Sarkar (government). They want the 'Sarokar' (conduct) to be changed as well. If we had worked according to the old ways and thought processes: Article 370 would never have been history. Muslim women would have kept suffering due to Triple Talaq,"" he said.

The prime minister said if his government worked as per the old ways, the Ram Janmabhoomi issue would have remained unsolved, Kartarpur Sahib corridor would not be a reality, there would be no India-Bangladesh land agreement.

Modi said the Congress did not remember to save the Constitution during Emergency and the 'Save Constitution' mantra is must ""for those who dismissed several state governments"".

Without naming Rahul Gandhi, Modi said, ""I heard an Opposition MP saying- we will beat Modi with sticks in 6 months. I have also decided I will do more 'Surya Namaskar'. This will make my back even stronger to face abuses. In any case, I have been abused so much for the last 2 decades that their negativity hardly matters"".

On the economy, the prime minister said the government has kept the fiscal deficit in check, price rise is also under check and there is macro-economic stability.

Modi said the agriculture budget, which was earlier Rs 27,000 crore, has now been increased by five times to about Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The agriculture budget has risen 5 times during the tenure of the NDA Government.

The prime minister said driven by politics, some states are not allowing farmers to benefit from the PM-Kisan Scheme.

""I appeal to them- let there be no politics in farmer welfare. We all have to work together for the prosperity of farmers of India,"" he said.

He said the PM-KISAN Samman Yojana is transforming the lives of many farmers. Several farmers have benefited due to this. In this scheme there are no middlemen and no extra file work.

Modi said the FDI in April-Sept 2018 stood at USD 22 billion, while in April-Sept 2019 it increased to USD 26 billion. This reflects confidence of foreign investors in India, he said.

Referring to the Northeast, Modi said for years, distance became a reason to ignore this region. Things have changed now and the region is becoming a growth engine as great work has been done in so many sectors and ministers and officials are regularly visiting the Northeast.

""Despite many efforts, the issue was unsolved for years. Whatever was done earlier was for meeting political ends, remained confined to papers.

""The Bodo Accord signed now is special because it has brought all stakeholders together and we are moving towards a more peaceful era,"" he said.

At the beginning of his speech, some Congress MPs raised slogans hailing Mahatma Gandhi with party leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury saying, ""it is just a trailer"".

At this Modi shot back: ""Mahatma Gandhi may be trailer for you, but he is life for us"".",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nda-govt-s-determination-solved-many-problems--modi-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nda-govt-s-determination-solved-many-problems--modi.html
215,06-2-20,What have you done for Delhiites? Kejriwal dares Shah for debate,"A day after daring the BJP to declare its Chief Minister candidate, AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday invited Union Home Minister Amit Shah for a public debate on any issue, saying the people of Delhi wanted to know why should they vote for the BJP in the February 8 Assembly polls.

Kejriwal said as Shah has asked voters to vote for him and he will decide who will be the CM of Delhi, he should come forward for debate.

“And since Shah Ji has been at the forefront, I would like to challenge Shah for a debate on any issue of his choice. People of Delhi have a lot of questions that need to be addressed. Issues like abrogation of Article 370 and Ram Mandir are national issues; people have already voted you in the Center for these issues. But what did the BJP do for Delhi? What did you do for the people of Delhi in the last five years? Why should people vote for you?” said Kejriwal.

Throwing number of questions to Shah, AAP chief said, “The people of Delhi want to know, why are you against providing free amenities and services to them? Why are you doing dirty politics on the Shaheen Bagh issue? Why are you not clearing the roads at Shaheen Bagh? Your motive for coming to power in Delhi has become evident, which justifies your inability to do something about Shaheen Bagh.”

People of Delhi want to know the reason behind inviting 200 MPs, 11 CMs and 70 Union Ministers to defeat a CM, he said.

Further asking for evidence and documents from BJP leader and Union Minister for calling him anarchist and terrorist, Kejriwal said, “Delhiites want to know, how is Delhi’s son Kejriwal a terrorist? Prakash Javadekar Ji said they have proofs that make me a terrorist. If you do, please bring forth the proofs and let people decide. Delhi wants to know, what have you done in Delhi for the last 15 years with the authority of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) with you? Why there are garbage dumps and landfills all across Delhi? What have you done for the improvement of MCD schools in Delhi?

“We have improved the Delhi Government schools in our tenure of five years, how many schools have you improved in your tenure all across the nation?” he added.

Also, he appealed to the BJP-led Central Government to not compromise on the security of the nation and asked it to take action against those disturbing law and order situation in Delhi.

“No compromise should be made with the security of the nation. I am not aware of the person who opened fire at Jamia have any ties with the party, but if he is even remotely related to AAP, he deserves the maximum punishment for what he has done.

“No matter what party he belongs to, he should be put to trial and strictest punishment should be given to him. All those who are responsible for the grave law and order situation in Delhi should be punished,” he said.

The national Capital wants to know the candidates likely to be the CM face of the BJP. “Is it Vijay Goel, Manoj Tiwari , Hardeep Singh Puri , Harshwardhan, Smriti Irani? Who should the people of Delhi consider their CM face while voting for BJP?” he asked.

Further challenging Shah, he said, “Open debate in a democracy is a positive thing. With honesty, I dare Shah for an open debate amongst the people of Delhi. And sending any random BJP worker for debate will discern that you are running away from real issues.”

Responding to a question on the polarisation tactics of the BJP, Kejriwal said, “India has been blessed with abundance in nature, resources along with brilliant and intelligent minds. But the system and politics in our nation are flawed. If we want to make India a 21st century nation, we need to build schools, hospitals, universities, construct roads and highways, conduct researches using science and technology. This will take the country forward. Hindu-Muslim rants would not take the country forward.”

Moreover, hitting back at the BJP for mocking him for reciting Hanuman Chalisa on a show, he said, “Everyone should read Hanuman Chalisa. I expect BJP members to read Hanuman Chalisa for peace.”

217,06-2-20,"5,300 quarantined off Japan, HK in 2 ships; coronavirus grips Asia","The global concerns on spread of deadly coronavirus escalated to a new level after nearly 5,300 persons were quarantined on two cruise ships off Hong Kong and Japan even as India on Wednesday revised its travel advisory stating that existing visas (including eVisa already issued) are no longer valid for any foreign national travelling from the pathogen-hit China where toll has reached 427.

An AFP reports from Tokyo said that at least 10 people on the cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan have tested positive for the coronavirus, Japan’s Health Minister said on Wednesday. Japan quarantined the vessel carrying 3,711 people and began testing those on board for the virus after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the illness.

Hundreds of travellers on board another cruise ship that docked in Hong Kong on Wednesday will be allowed to leave the vessel after health checks, the operator said, despite three recent passengers testing positive for noval coronavirus.

In India, a total 741 people have been tested for coronavirus of which 738 have been tested negative. Three persons, all from Kerala, who have found to be positive, are kept in the isolation and under quarantine period. These three patients had returned from Wuhan, China, epicentre of the outbreak. Also, 5,123 people are under home surveillance, said a statement from the Union Health Ministry. India has, so far, screened 89,500 passengers from 777 flights at 21 airports for symptoms of coronavirus, the statement added.

Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Guaba on Wednesday held a high-level meeting to review the actions taken for management of coronavirus and preparedness of States for the same with Secretaries of Health and Family Welfare, External Affairs, Civil Aviation, Pharma, Dept of Health Research, Member Secretary (NDMA) and other officials from Home Ministry, Commerce, Army and Defence.

In view of the evolving scenario related with coronavirus, existing visas (including eVisa already issued) are no longer valid for any foreign national travelling from China, said the statement.

Indian citizens have already been advised to refrain from travel to China through an earlier advisory. People traveling to China henceforth will be quarantined on return. Officials from the Ministry of Tourism said they were coordinating with hotel associations for wider self-reporting by travellers visiting religious and other tourist places in States.

Intending visitors have been asked to contact Embassy in Beijing (visa.beijing@mea.gov.in) or the Consulates in Shanghai (Ccons.shanghai@mea.gov.in) and Guangzhou (Visa.guangzhou@mea.gov.in) to apply afresh for an Indian visa.

Meanwhile, China on Monday hoped that India will not put trade restrictions and limit movement of people to the country in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic in its Hubei province. In an interview to PTI, Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong said China’s Foreign Ministry and local Governments are working hard to ensure the safety of Indians and people working in Indian diplomatic missions in China.

Admitting that there could be a short-term impact of the epidemic on China’s economy, he said the country’s internal resilience is growing and it has ample resources and policy tools to cope with economic volatility.

“I am confident that it should not and will not be hindered by short-term difficulties. We should not suspend but expand the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/5-300-quarantined-off--japan--hk-in-2-ships--coronavirus-grips-asia-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/5-300-quarantined-off--japan--hk-in-2-ships--coronavirus-grips-asia.html

The 25-year-old accused, a driver by profession, was arrested, they added. The incident took place on Saturday and a complaint was lodged by the girl’s family members on Sunday, the police said, adding that the child is stable now.

On the statement of the victim’s mother, a rape case was registered under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, they said.

According to the police, both the victim and the accused lived at the embassy quarters. The girl’s father works as a housekeeping staff at the embassy. The accused does not work at the embassy and stays with his parents at the quarters there. However, his father is employed with the embassy.

The girl used to often visit the residence of the accused as they were neighbours, a senior police officer said. On the day of the incident, she was playing outside her house when the accused, on the pretext of playing games on his mobile phone, took her to his residence, where he raped her in the absence of his parents, the officer added.

After reaching her house, the victim complained to her mother about discomfort and irritation in her private parts, he said. When the victim’s mother questioned the girl, she narrated her ordeal, after which the former approached the police and lodged a complaint.

219,06-2-20,Nirbhaya rapists have 7 days to exhaust remedy options,"The Delhi High Court on Wednesday set a 7-day deadline for the four Nirbhaya case death-row convicts to exhaust their remaining legal remedies but at the same time refused to stay a trial court order that postponed the February 2 death warrant.

The HC said the four have to be hanged together and not separately and faulted the authorities concerned for not taking steps for issuance of death warrant after the rejection of appeals of the convicts by the Supreme Court in 2017.

The HC said, “It cannot be disputed that the convicts have frustrated the process by using delaying tactics.” The HC made it clear that if the four convicts choose not to make any type of petition in seven days from now, the authorities concerned will deal with the matter, as per the law, without further delay.

The Centre and the Delhi Government moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday challenging the rejection of their plea by the HC

against the trial court order staying the hanging of the four convicts.

Meanwhile, President Ram Nath Kovind has rejected the mercy petition of Akshay Kumar Singh, one of the four men facing gallows in the Nirbhaya case, Home Ministry officials.

Reacting to the HC decision, Nirbhaya's mother Asha Devi said she will be happy only on the day when all convicts are hanged.

The trial court had on January 31 stayed “till further orders” execution of the four convicts in the case — Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26), and Akshay Kumar (31).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-rapists-have-7-days-to-exhaust-remedy-options-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nirbhaya-rapists-have-7-days-to-exhaust-remedy-options.html
220,06-2-20,US expresses concern over religious freedom in India,"The US has expressed concern over the current situation of religious freedom in India and raised the issue with Indian officials, a senior State Department official has said.

The remarks came in the wake of widespread protests held across India against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The senior State Department official, on condition of anonymity, said that he has met with officials in India about what is taking place in the nation and expressed concern.

""We are concerned about what's taking place in India. I have met with the Indian foreign minister. I've met with the Indian ambassador (to express my concern),"" the official, who was recently in India, told reporters on Wednesday.

The US has also ""expressed desire first to try to help and work through some of these issues"", the official said as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launched a 27-nation International Religious Freedom Alliance.

""To me, the initial step we try to do in most places is say what can we do to be of help you work through an issue to where there's not religious persecution. That's the first step, is just saying can we work with you on this,"" the official said.

India maintains that the Indian Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to all its citizens, including its minority communities.

It is widely acknowledged that India is a vibrant democracy where the Constitution provides protection of religious freedom, and where democratic governance and rule of law further promote and protect fundamental rights, a senior official of the Ministry of External Affairs has said.

According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 following religious persecution there will get Indian citizenship.

The Indian government has been emphasising that the new law will not deny any citizenship rights, but has been brought to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and give them citizenship.

Defending the CAA, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month said that the law is not about taking away citizenship, it is about giving citizenship.

""We must all know that any person of any religion from any country of the world who believes in India and its Constitution can apply for Indian citizenship through due process. There's no problem in that,"" he said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-expresses-concern-over-religious-freedom-in-india-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/us-expresses-concern-over-religious-freedom-in-india.html

222,06-2-20,"Seven, including 3 children, dead in carpet factory gas leak","Seven people, including three children, were on Thursday killed after inhaling poisonous gas that leaked inside a carpet factory at Jalalpur village in Bisvan area, about 35 kms from here, police said.

Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM), Bisvan, Suresh Kumar said a team of experts has arrived for investigation from Lucknow and a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team is also present at the spot.

""The affected area has been evacuated. Any information about the tragedy would be given out after investigation. Some dogs were also found dead around the factory area,"" the SDM added.

Asked for details of the gas leak, he said, ""A tanker of the adjoining acid factory was washed near this carpet factory. Possibly, gas leaked from that and caused the damage.""

223,06-2-20,"PM talking of Nehru, Pak, but silent on main issue of unemployment: Rahul","PCongress leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not talking about the main issue of unemployment and alleged that he was distracting people by talking about other things from Jawaharlal Nehru to Pakistan.

Hitting back at Modi after the prime minister replied to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President's Address in Lok Sabha, Gandhi said the biggest issue before the country is of unemployment and economy, on which the PM did not speak.

""All youngsters of this country want that after studies -- school, college university -- they get employment. We asked the prime minister repeatedly that you have given a one and a half hour speech and if for 2 minutes you can tell the youth about employment and what your government has done about it,"" he said.

""You would have seen, youngsters saw, that the PM could not give a reply,"" the former Congress president said while speaking to reporters outside Parliament.

Earlier, the government used to talk about economy, Make in India, USD 5 trillion, but the prime minister now does not talk about the biggest issue facing the country and is distracting the people by talking about other things, ranging from the Congress and Nehru to Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Both the prime minister and Fiance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman have failed to reply on issues like providing employment to youth and putting the economy on the right track, Gandhi.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm-talking-of-nehru--pak--but-silent-on-main-issue-of-unemployment--rahul-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pm-talking-of-nehru--pak--but-silent-on-main-issue-of-unemployment--rahul.html
224,06-2-20,"Street protests, arson against legislature's decisions road to Anarchy: Modi","Accusing the Opposition of inciting protests against the CAA, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday warned that street agitations against decisions of Parliament and state assemblies may lead to ""anarchy"" and that everyone should be worried over it.

Strongly defending the Citizenship (Amendment) Act which has triggered protests, Modi reiterated in Lok Sabha that it does not affect any Indian citizen and poses no harm to minorities, and said those rejected by people in elections are fuelling protests against it for their ""vote bank politics"".

He accused the Opposition of using all its might to stoke ""imaginary"" fears about the law, which grants citizenship to minorities from three Muslim countries in the neighbourhood, and likened its stand to that of Pakistan, saying Islamabad spoke the same language for decades to mislead and incite Indian Muslims.

Pakistan could not succeed, and what has surprised him that those thrown out of power by voters here have resorted to doing such things, Modi said in his over 100-minute-long reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address, which was later passed by Lok Sabha.

So much criticism of the CAA has been made ironically by those who love getting photographed with the group of people who want ""tukde tukde"" of India, he said, adding that even courts have asserted that protests should not inconvenience people and be not marked by violence.

""We have seen the kind of speeches and remarks were made recently (in these protests). Big leaders of opposition go there. I regret it,"" he said.

Top BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah, have often hit out at these protests, including the one in Shaheen Bagh here, saying anti-India and radical speeches have been made there.

The prime minister delivered rebuttal to the Opposition over most issues its members raised to criticise his government and took on the charge that he pursued communal politics and wanted Hindu rashtra. He cited comments of Jawaharlal Nehru to back the law and said the Congress stalwart wanted citizenship for minorities from Pakistan.

Modi also touched on the issues of Kashmir, economy, unemployment and farmers distress while taking frequent digs at rivals, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi whom he dubbed a ""tubelight"".

The Congress was expected to be a responsible Opposition, but it had taken a wrong turn, he said.

Noting that the CAA was passed by Parliament and duly notified, he told Opposition parties that the road taken by them raises worries, a reference to anti-CAA protests and support to them by many anti-BJP parties.

What will happen if people refuse to accept a decision taken by the Rajasthan assembly, stage dharnas and resort to arson, Modi said and gave a similar example of Madhya Pradesh. The Congress is in power in the two states.

""What will then happen? Can the country run this way? This is road to anarchy... Such a way can put you (Opposition) in trouble as well. I am giving this warning as we all should be concerned about the country,"" the prime minister said.

""It is due to your work that people have sent you there,"" he said, referring to the Opposition benches. ""Everybody has a right to put across their point of views but no good will come out of spreading lies and rumours. Respect the Constitution,"" he added.

Hitting back at the Congress over its charge that his government violated the Constitution, Modi said it should be the party's mantra to speak frequently about ""saving Constitution"" so that it remembers its sanctity.

The Congress government imposed the Emergency, curbed judiciary's powers, spoke against people's right to life and dismissed Opposition-run state governments frequently, he said. ""We believe in the Constitution,"" he added.

He also dubbed the National Advisory Council, a body set up during the UPA era to advise the Manmohan Singh government and headed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, as a ""remote control"" that enjoyed a ""bigger role"" than the prime minister.

Questioning if such a body was constitutional, Modi also recalled as to how Rahul Gandhi had torn a bill passed by the UPA government to attack the Congress.

Modi recited a verse to take a swipe at Opposition parties for their backing to anti-CAA protests and referred to their leaders making speeches there.

People associated with the Congress and the Left have been inciting people, he said.

Quoting Nehru, Modi said India's first prime minister in a letter to the then Assam chief minister in 1950 had asked him to distinguish between Hindu refugees and Muslim migrants from Pakistan and said the law should be amended to grant citizenship to the refugees if required.

""This was not only Mahatma Gandhi's but also Nehru's sentiments. Was Pandit Nehru communal? Did he discriminate between Hindus and Muslims? Did he want Hindu rashtra?"" Modi asked, asserting that several reports, including those of parliamentary panels, had recommended a law like the CAA.

He said the Congress is having problems when his government is taking decisions to fulfil wishes of the country's ""founding fathers"".

The Opposition has frequently accused the Modi government of pursuing communal politics, discriminating against Muslims and seeking to make India a Hindu rashtra.

The country would not have seen the real face of the Opposition if it had not made so much of noise against the law, he said.

Taking a swipe at Opposition members for invoking contributions of Muslims to India's freedom struggle, he said they look at them as Muslims but they are Indians to his party.

The prime minister said that he in his youth had touched the feet of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and named other greats like Ashfaqullah Khan, Begum Hazrat Mahal and A P J Abdul Kalam to assert that they were all Indians.

Describing Kashmir as ""crown jewel"" of India, he said his government has pushed development measures in Jammu and Kashmir and asserted that it had faith in the people of valley.

Modi cited comments of Kashmir leaders Farooq Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, who had warned that any decision to nullify Article 370 may sever the valley's link with India, to ask if those who believe in India's Constitution can tolerate these remarks.

Modi said Kashmir's identity was buried on January 19, 1990, when Kashmiri Pandits started leaving the valley due to militancy.

Elaborating on his government's achievements, the prime minister said the people of the country have seen his government's work between 2014 and 2019 and gave a bigger mandate in 2019.

Modi said India can no longer wait for problems to remain unsolved, and, rightfully so. ""That is why, our aim is speed and scale, determination and decisiveness, sensitivity and solutions"".

Without naming Rahul Gandhi, Modi said, ""I heard an Opposition MP saying 'we will beat Modi with sticks in 6 months'. I have also decided I will do more 'Surya Namaskar'. This will make my back even stronger to face abuses. In any case, I have been abused so much for the last 2 decades that their negativity hardly matters.""

Referring to the Northeast, Modi said, ""The Bodo Accord signed now is special because it has brought all stakeholders together and we are moving towards a more peaceful era. It has ushered in a new dawn.""",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/street-protests--arson-against-legislature-s-decisions-road-to-anarchy--modi-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/street-protests--arson-against-legislature-s-decisions-road-to-anarchy--modi.html
225,06-2-20,UK court clears extradition of Dawood's aide Jabir Moti to US,"Pakistani-national Jabir Moti, described as a ""top lieutenant"" of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's D-Company, on Thursday lost his fight against being sent to the US to face drug trafficking and money laundering charges, as a UK court ruled there are no bars to his extradition.

Judge John Zani handed down his judgment at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London in two parts - one open to the public and partly closed and classified, due to ""sensitive"" evidence presented in-camera to the court during the course of the extradition trial last year.

""I have rejected all your challenges. I have thought them through carefully, but I have decided to send the matter to the Secretary of State to decide on extradition,"" the judge said, as he handed down the open part of the ruling.

UK Home Secretary Priti Patel must now sign off on the court order for the extradition process to take place within two months.

The US extradition request had stated that Moti a.K.A. Motiwala a.K.A. Jabir Siddiq reported directly to Dawood, who is a designated terrorist and wanted in India for the 1993 serial bombings in Mumbai.

Meanwhile, Moti's legal team indicated that ""most likely than not"" they would be seeking permission to appeal in the High Court, which can take place once Patel has signed the extradition order.

Unlike the India-UK Extradition Treaty, the US-UK treaty involves a relatively simpler legal process for extradition as the requesting state does not require to establish an elaborate prima facie case against the accused before the British courts.

An unshaven Moti appeared via videolink from Wandsworth prison in south-west London for the hearing and appeared emotionless as the verdict was read out. Besides money laundering, he faces extradition to the US on charges of extortion and conspiracy to import unlawful substances such as heroine after his arrest by Scotland Yard's Extradition Unit in August 2018.

""I find that Jabir Motiwala's extradition to the United States of America to face criminal prosecution complies with his Convention Rights within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998…I also find that there are no bars to this extradition as would intervene to prevent extradition,"" the judgment notes.

The judgement further notes that according to information set out in the US extradition request, the 53-year-old is said to be an important member of an international criminal organisation called 'D Company', based in Pakistan, India and UAE. That organisation is said to have conducted criminal activities in the US, which include drug trafficking, money laundering and blackmail.

During closing arguments in the case in November last year, the judge had sought clarity from the US authorities about the terror aspect of the case, due to references to Moti's links with D-Company.

""There is an added element to this case in that there is a clear reference to this man's (Moti) position, who is said to be a lieutenant of the man (Dawood) who is involved in the most horrendous crimes, including bombings in India,"" Judge Zani had noted previously.

Moti's barrister Edward Fitzgerald had stressed that the American authorities had failed to provide an undertaking that his client will not be subjected to an additional terrorism charge over and above the drug trafficking allegation.

The terror charge would put Moti at risk of being sentenced to life imprisonment without parole under US law, which his lawyer argued would be in breach of his human rights and therefore should block his extradition.

They also argued against extradition on additional human rights grounds because he suffers from longstanding depression and made three suicide attempts.

The Crown Prosecution Service, arguing on behalf of the US government, had countered these claims to highlight the assurances given by the US authorities.

In his ruling on Thursday, Judge Zani concluded that he was satisfied that the US authorities are well aware of Moti's mental health issues and evidence received from them states that they remain confident that his needs will be adequately met and that appropriate medication will be provided.

At previous hearings in the case, the UK court has heard that Dawood is a fugitive from Indian justice and currently in Pakistan.

""The head of D-Company is Dawood Ibrahim, an Indian Muslim currently in exile in Pakistan. Dawood and his brother and top lieutenant, Anis Ibrahim, have been fugitives from India since 1993, when D-Company was implicated in coordinated bombings in Mumbai that killed more than 200 people,"" note excerpts of a US Attorney's affidavit for extradition read out in court last year.

""The present investigation has revealed that Jabir Motiwala is a top lieutenant in D-Company who reports directly to Dawood Ibrahim,” it added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-court-clears-extradition-of-dawood-s-aide-jabir-moti-to-us-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/uk-court-clears-extradition-of-dawood-s-aide-jabir-moti-to-us.html
226,06-2-20,"PM Modi defends NPR, says updating it will help give benefits of govt schemes to poor","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched a strong defence of the National Population Register (NPR), saying it was being updated to allow the rightful beneficiaries get the benefit of government welfare schemes.

In Rajya Sabha, he said the NPR was first done in 2010 and later updated in 2015.

He said census and NPR are ""usual administrative"" processes which have been carried out previously as well but have now suddenly become contentious.

Questions asked in the NPR are purely governance related, he said citing the example of asking citizens of the language spoken by them and their parents are deeply linked to the schools that need to be set up in that particular area.

227,06-2-20,Ram Lalla left in trust of 15-member team,"PM announces in LS autonomous body for temple construction, 5 acre land for Sunny Waqf

Amid chants of Jai Shri Ram by the ruling BJP members, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday announced in the Lok Sabha the formation of a 15-member trust — Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra — to construct a Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

Resolving the Ayodhya temple dispute in its landmark judgment, the Supreme Court has asked the Government to form a trust for temple construction and allot five acre land by February 9 for the construction of a mosque.

As per the SC order, the Uttar Pradesh Government on Wednesday allotted five acre to Sunni Waqf Board in Ayodhya district at Dhannipur village, 19 kilometres from the district headquarters.

Making a statement in the Lok Sabha soon after a meeting of the Union Cabinet, the Prime Minister said he wants to share information on a “very important and historical subject for the country.”

“This topic is close to my heart like millions of countrymen and I consider it my great fortune to talk about it,” he said, declaring the trust. “An autonomous trust has been formed, it is called ‘Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra,” said Modi, with the Lok Sabha witnessing the chanting of “Jai Shri Ram” by the Treasury Bench.

The Prime Minister said after the verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi issue came out, the people of India displayed remarkable faith in democratic processes and procedures.

“I salute the 130 crore people of India,” Modi said in his over 10-minute long address. “Let us all support construction of a grand Ram Temple in Ayodhya,” he said.

“Our culture, our traditions give us the vision of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam and Sarve Bhavantu Sukhina. It also gives inspiration to move forward with this feeling. In India, people of all faiths, be it Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Parsis and Jains, we are all members of a broad family. May every member of this family be happy, be healthy, prosper, develop the country with the same spirit,” he said.

The PM said the Government is following the mantra of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas”. All the members should express their support for the construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya, he said.

Soon after the Prime Minister’s announcement, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said the trust will have 15 members, including one from the Dalit community. In the evening Union Home Ministry issued notification on the formation the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, with its office in Delhi’s Greater Kailash locality. A trust named “Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra” was registered with its registered office at R-20, Greater Kailash Part-1, New Delhi 110048, the notification said. This is the Delhi residence of legal luminary and two-time Attorney General of India K Parasaran, the lead counsel for the Hindu parties in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute case.

In a notification, the Ministry also said the Uttar Pradesh Government had already issued the allotment letter of a five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for construction of a mosque, as directed by the Supreme Court.

The land earmarked for the construction of mosque by Sunni Wakf Board is in Dhannipur village in tehsil Sohawal in Ayodhya on the Lucknow highway, about 19 kilometres from the district headquarters, State Government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma told reporters. The decision was taken at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday morning.

“The State Government had sent three alternatives for land to the Centre. This one was accepted by the Centre and the State Cabinet has approved its allotment. There is good transportation facility to reach here and communal amity and law and order are also good,” Sharma added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ram-lalla-left-in-trust-of-15-member-team-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/ram-lalla-left-in-trust-of-15-member-team.html
228,06-2-20,PM sets $5bn Defence export target in 5 years,"Modi inaugurates DefExpo, pushes for self-reliance

Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated India’s largest ever DefExpo 2020 in Lucknow on Wednesday and set a target of defence exports worth $5 billion (Rs 35,000 crore) in the next five years.

Stressing the need for India to attain self-reliance in military needs to face present and future security challenges, Modi said unless the country controls its massive defence import bill, the dream of becoming a $5 trillion economy could not be realised.

“India has been a major military power in the past but post-Independence the country failed to capitalise on its historical capabilities of indigenously producing its defence needs. India is the largest democracy in the world, has the second largest Army, fifth largest economy and is also the biggest arms importer. How long can we heavily rely on imports,’’ asked the PM.

However, Modi observed that India’s pursuit of self-reliance was to secure its national interests, especially against the backdrop of threats it faced in the region, and not targeted against any nation.

“India never had expansionist ambitions and never attacked any country nor will we ever do it. Besides our own defence, we have also obligations towards the security of our neighbours in Indian Ocean region. We are not interested in warfare, but welfare,’’ Modi pointed out.

The PM said from defence exports valued at Rs 2,000 crore a few years back, the nation had achieved defence exports worth Rs 17,000 crore so far. “But our target is to hit $5 billion in the next five years,” he said.

“India has always been a trusted partner for world peace and contributed during the two World Wars despite having no direct stakes in these conflicts. Nearly 6,000 Indian security personnel were currently deployed in the UN Peace Keeping missions in African nations,” Modi said.

Underlining the importance of “Make in India”, the PM said DefExpo 2020 is among the biggest defence shows globally and would contribute immensely towards showcasing India as an ideal investment destination for military hardware. “India is not only a big market, but offers huge business opportunities,” Modi told foreign investors and assured that their investments would provide good returns and help India become self-reliant in defence needs.

The PM further said that Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was helping defence sector start-ups to scale up and develop new products based on modern technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) etc.

Meanwhile, Modi espoused the development of defence manufacturing capacity in domestic private sector and talked about enabling policies, including liberal licensing regime, implemented by Central Government and defence establishments to promote collaboration. “The DRDO was facilitating free transfer of defence technologies and created five new testing labs for start-ups to promote innovation,” he said.

Referring to Defence Manufacturing Corridors in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, Modi said that these hubs would not only help India become self-reliant in defence manufacturing but also help micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME).

He said that Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was exploring outer space for public welfare and not for warfare, while DRDO was developing capabilities to protect these outer space assets from potential threats.

The Prime Minister said his Government has introduced several reforms in the Defence Ministry and implemented ease of doing business (EODB) resulting in sharp increase in number of licence issued by the Ministry from 210 to 460 in the last five years.

“India today is building several defence equipment like artillery guns, aircraft carriers, submarines, frigates, light-combat aircraft, and combat helicopters,” he said.

Modi cited misuse of technology, terrorism and cyber threat as challenges facing the world and said that defence forces were eyeing new technology considering new threats. “India is not behind others. A roadmap has been finalised to use application of artificial intelligence in defence sector,” he said.

Modi said that the creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff and Department of Military Affairs would boost the overall defence production.

Earlier, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh made a detailed presentation about the plans of his Ministry and said that it was pursuing three Ps - policies, promotion and partnership.

The 11th edition of biennial DefExpo 2020 during February 5-9 will feature 1,000 exhibitors, including 165 foreign companies from the US, France, Germany, Russia, Israel, Australia etc, making it the largest ever defence show surpassing the 10th edition of DefExpo 2018 in Chennai, when about 700 exhibitors participated.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm-sets--5bn-defence--export-target-in-5-years-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/pm-sets--5bn-defence--export-target-in-5-years.html
229,06-2-20,Vaping may cause breathing problem in teenagers,"Researchers have revealed that using e-cigarette or vaping may cause breathing and swallowing problem in teenagers.

According to the study, published in the journal Pediatrics, a teenage girl with no hint of prior asthma or respiratory illness began to feel hoarseness in her throat and a feeling that she needed to clear her throat frequently.

Within a few weeks, her hoarseness and throat-clearing worsened with early morning voice loss and feeling as if food were lodged in her throat. She started having trouble swallowing and began to avoid food all together.

Examining her throat, pediatrician confirmed moderate swelling and a partially obstructed airway draped with thick chartreuse-colored mucus.

The teen had no history of an autoimmune disorder, no international travel and no exposure to animals. She had no fever and had received all her scheduled immunisations.

But in speaking with doctors at Children's National Hospital in the US, the teen had admitted to using candy-and fruit-flavoured e-cigarettes three to five times with her friends over the two months preceding her symptoms.

The last time she vaped was two weeks before her unusual symptoms began.

""With epiglottitis - an inflammation of the flap found at the base of the tongue that prevents food from entering the trachea - our first concern is that an underlying infection is to blame,"" says study author Michael Jason Bozzella.

""This teenager's use of e-cigarettes is the most plausible reason for this subacute epiglottitis diagnosis, a condition that can become life-threatening,"" said Kathleen Ferrer, a hospitalist at Children's National and the case report's senior author.

""This unusual case adds to a growing list of toxic effects attributable to vaping. While we normally investigate infectious triggers, like Streptococci, Staphylococci and Haemophilus, we and other health care providers should also consider e-cigarettes as we evaluate oro-respiratory complaints,"" Ferrer added.

According to the researchers, every throat culture and biopsy result showed no evidence of fungal, bacterial or viral infection, acid-fast bacilli or other malignancy.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2,668 people in the US have been hospitalised for e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury, as of Jan 14, 2020.

The Children's National case report's authors said the increasing use of vaping products by teenagers highlights the potential for unknown health risks to continue to grow.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vaping-may-cause-breathing-problem-in-teenagers-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/vaping-may-cause-breathing-problem-in-teenagers.html
230,06-2-20,Only a few launches take shine off Auto Expo,"The 15th Auto Expo was kicked off by the country’s largest carmaker Maruti-Suzuki as it historically has been, early in the morning. But the eight o’clock start on a cold Wednesday morning at the India Expo Mart in Greater Noida could not take away from the fact that this Auto Expo was a little bit “thanda” (cold) in a matter of speaking for seasoned auto industry veterans.

With all major two-wheeler manufacturers with the exception of Suzuki and several large automobile manufacturers such as Honda, Ford, Audi and BMW as well as commercial vehicle manufacturers such as Ashok Leyland and Volvo-Eicher steering clear of the Auto Expo, the India Expo mart looked and felt emptier than it usually is for this celebration of the Indian automotive industry.

This was in no small part thanks to the last eighteen months for the industry, collapsing sales, rapidly declining margins and policy paralysis surrounding the introduction (or not) of electric vehicles, spending a few crores on a stand at the show might have seemed like an extravagance.

Indeed, if it were not for the Chinese manufacturers such as Shanghai Automotive Industrial Corporation (SAIC) through MG Motor and the soon to launch Great Wall Motors (GWM) even more halls might have gone empty.

But that did not stop a slew of new concepts that were introduced and new vehicles showcased at the Auto Expo. The shows-topper on the first day was the rebirth of Tata Motors’ Sierra SUV. The original Sierra which many consider India’s first “real” Sports Utility Vehicle has been given a modern makeover and while Tata Motors officials were quick to point out that this was just a concept, it really got the assembled crowds going. Maruti-Suzuki showcased the Futuro-E the concept of their future electric platform but gave no timelines of when such a vehicle will hit the roads although Kenichi Ayukawa, Managing Director, Maruti-Suzuki took a “pledge” that the carmaker would sell a million green vehicles, including CNG, hybrids and electrics in the coming decade.

However, it was French carmaker Renault that launched the first car of the Expo, the automatic version of the Triber.

Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia also took the opportunity to showcase their next concept vehicles, Hyundai showcased their facelifted Tucson and will unveil the second-generation Creta today with Kia showcasing their compact SUV, the ‘Sonet’. Kia also launched their much awaited MPV, the Carnival which has been priced between Rs 25-34 lakh. Mahindra and Mahindra announced their latest range of engines which will be used on Ssangyong and Ford vehicles and the Indian manufacturer also launched their eKUV electric small car at Rs 8.75 lakh. Chinese manufacturers SAIC and GWM also showcasing their upcoming products including small urban electric cars and SUV’s. German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz, the only luxury manufacturer participating at the show showcased their upcoming A-Class limousine and GLA SUV, both of which will be launched later this year.

On the whole this was a relatively dull Auto Expo, but the overwhelming feeling from automobile manufacturers is that 2020 might see a revival of demand, which collapsed a few months after the previous Expo held in 2018. Will that happen? Keep watching this space.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/only-a-few-launches-take-shine-off-auto-expo-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/only-a-few-launches-take-shine-off-auto-expo.html

Bhatt, is the showrunner of ""Dil Jaise Dhadke... Dhadakane Do"", which revolves around a godman (Rahul Azam) and two children whose souls have been damned by destiny.

Directed by Guroudev Bhalla, the show stars child actors Jared Albert Savaille and Hirva Trivedi, besides Shruti Seth and Rahil Azam.

""There is nothing significant that can be made without any controversy. Whenever you come up with a new point, there will be people who will say things from opposite perspective. Since when controversy became a bad word?

""A contrarian view is a relevant part of society. Like, how a house is built on two pillars and both of them are opposite.

It is to note that the South Korean giant has made improvements to the overall sound quality of the earbuds, but the design isn't going to be all that different from the previous gen model.

238,06-2-20,Trump acquitted of all impeachment charges,"The United States Senate Wednesday acquitted President Donald Trump on two articles of impeachment -- abuse of power and obstruction to Congress -- giving him a major political and moral victory in an election year.

The Republican-majority Senate voted 52-48 to acquit him of abuse of power and 53-47 to acquit him of obstruction of Congress, thus preventing the Democratic move to overthrow him, for which they required two-thirds of votes in the 100-member House.

The ruling Republican party has 53 seats while the Democrats have 47.

Republican Senator Mitt Romney, a bitter critic of Trump and who was the party's presidential nominee in 2012, voted against the president on the first charge, but followed the party line on the second article of impeachment. Rest of the members voted on party lines.

""The President is pleased to put this latest chapter of shameful behavior by the Democrats in the past, and looks forward to continuing his work on behalf of the American people in 2020 and beyond,"" the White House said soon thereafter.

Trump announced on Twitter that he will make a public statement Thursday noon from the White House ""to discuss our Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax!""

The White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham slammed the Democrats.

""Today, the sham impeachment attempt concocted by Democrats ended in the full vindication and exoneration of President Donald J. Trump. As we have said all along, he is not guilty,"" she said.

""The Senate voted to reject the baseless articles of impeachment, and only the President's political opponents – all Democrats, and one failed Republican presidential candidate – voted for the manufactured impeachment articles,"" Grisham said.

Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said, ""The do-nothing Democrats know they can't beat him, so they had to impeach him. This terrible ordeal was always a campaign tactic to invalidate the 2016 votes of 63 million Americans and was a transparent effort to interfere with the 2020 election, only nine months away.""

Opposition Democratic party accused the Republican-dominated Senate of ignoring the facts, ""the will of the American people and their duty to the Constitution"".

Said Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, ""Today, the President and Senate Republicans have normalized lawlessness and rejected the system of checks and balances of our Constitution.""

""The President will boast that he has been acquitted. There can be no acquittal without a trial, and there is no trial without witnesses, documents and evidence,"" Pelosi said.

""By suppressing the evidence and rejecting the most basic elements of a fair judicial process, the Republican Senate made themselves willing accomplices to the President's cover-up,"" said the top Democratic leader.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer described it as a sad day for the republic.

""The United States Senate, acting as a court of impeachment under our Constitution, did not remove a president who abused his power and invited foreign interference in the upcoming election to benefit himself personally,"" he said.

""The bipartisan vote in favor of holding him accountable and preserving, protecting, and defending our Constitution against a clear, impeachable offense was, unfortunately, not enough to overcome a partisan firewall of senators who chose loyalty to President Trump over loyalty to their oaths,"" Hoyer said.

In her statement, Grisham said it was yet another witch-hunt that deprived the President of his due process and rights and was based on a series of lies.

""Rep. Adam Schiff lied to Congress and the American people with a totally made up statement about the President's phone call. Will there be no retribution? Speaker Nancy Pelosi also lied to the American people about the need to swiftly pass impeachment articles they dreamt up, only to sit on them for a month before sending over to the Senate,"" she said.

239,06-2-20,Avalanches kill nearly 40 in eastern Turkey,"At least 33 people were killed in eastern Turkey Wednesday by a second avalanche which buried a team of rescuers searching for people hit by the first the day before.

The bodies of 33 rescue workers and civilians were discovered in Van province, where they had been helping dig out a minibus buried by snow late Tuesday, the government's disaster agency AFAD said.

Five people aboard the vehicle were killed, taking the overall toll to 38. Eight people had been rescued alive from the first avalanche.

Television images showed dozens of people scrambling up the mountains, digging through snow in blizzards to find those trapped under the snow.

The number of those injured was 53 in total after the second avalanche hit after 0900 GMT between Bahcesaray and Catak districts, AFAD said.

Health Minister Fahrettin Koca warned the number of casualties could rise as local media reported an unknown number of people could still be under the snow.

The rescuers had been searching for two people from Tuesday's incident, AFAD's Van province chairman Osman Ucar told reporters from his hospital bed.

He was among those injured including former ruling party MP for Van, Gulsen Orhan, who now advises President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Van governor Mehmet Emin Bilmez said rescue efforts continued despite the difficult winter conditions causing transport problems with heavy snow continuing to fall on the mountainside.

Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said rescuers had paused overnight and resumed their efforts Wednesday morning to find the last two people.

Authorities were alerted to the first avalanche when snow-clearing vehicle operator Bahattin Karagulle escaped from his snow-covered machine and informed officials of what had happened, Milliyet daily reported.

The AFAD agency sent dozens of rescue workers after the first disaster while gendarmerie officers and firefighters provided assistance.

Local media reported that residents in nearby areas also joined the rescue efforts in an area difficult to reach in harsh winter conditions.

Television images showed dozens of people scrambling up the mountains, digging through snow in blizzards to find those caught under the snow.

A special military plane with 75 gendarmerie officers and other rescue officials were on their way from Ankara, AFAD and the defence ministry said.

Erdogan spoke to Soylu to obtain information on the efforts, the presidency said.

The president's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, also said on Twitter that ""every tool available was mobilised"" to help officials.

Christian Berger, the EU ambassador to Turkey, offered his ""deepest sympathies and heartfelt condolences"" as did the US embassy to Turkey on Twitter.

Last month, the eastern province of Elazig was hit by a powerful 6.7-magnitude earthquake, killing 41 people and injuring over 1,600 others.

A 2009 avalanche in the northeastern province of Gumushane killed 11 climbers in the Zigana mountains.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/avalanches-kill-nearly-40-in-eastern-turkey-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/avalanches-kill-nearly-40-in-eastern-turkey.html
240,06-2-20,Plane breaks into three after skidding off Istanbul runway,"A plane carrying 177 people skidded off the runway at an Istanbul airport, caught fire and split into three after landing in rough weather on Wednesday.

Officials said that no-one had lost their lives in the spectacular accident, but 120 people were injured.

Live images broadcast on Turkish television showed several people climbing through a large crack in the severed aircraft and escaping onto one of the wings at the rear.

The Boeing 737 operated by Turkish low-cost carrier Pegasus Airlines had flown into Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen airport from the Aegean port city of Izmir, NTV television reported.

The plane was apparently buffeted by strong winds and heavy rain lashing Istanbul, Turkey's largest city.

""At the moment, 120 people who were injured have been hospitalised,"" said governor Ali Yerlikaya, adding that most of them were ""doing well, aside from one or two people."" There were no deaths.

""Some passengers evacuated the plane by themselves but others are stuck inside and our rescuers are working to free them,"" Transport Minister Mehmet Cahit Turhan said on CNN-Turk television.

The plane was carrying 171 passengers and six crew members, the governor said, while Turkish media reports said there were 12 children on board.

Governor Yerlikaya said the plane ""slid some 60 metres"" after skidding off the runway, and then ""fell about 30-40 metres"" down a bank.

The accident, which he attributed to bad weather, ""could have had more serious consequences,"" he said.

NTV showed images of the badly damaged plane and flames inside, which were later put out by firefighters.

After darkness fell, television footage showed dozens of rescue workers in high-visibility jackets surrounding the plane with flashlights.

Some sprayed water jets onto the severed body of the aircraft, while others could be seen climbing up onto the plane to comb through the cabin.

According to NTV, Turhan said the plane broke after a ""strong landing"" at Sabiha Gokcen, one of two main international airports in Istanbul.

The front of the plane including the cockpit was sliced off from bulk of the fuselage, and another huge fissure separated the rear of the aircraft including the tail.

Sabiha Gokcen, which lies on the Asian side of Turkey's commercial hub, was closed and flights were being redirected to Istanbul's main airport.

There had been very strong winds and rain in the area before the incident and poor weather conditions in Istanbul, particularly in winter, often lead to the cancellation of flights.

The Istanbul public prosecutor has launched an investigation into the incident.

The plane had landed at the airport at 1518 GMT, the private DHA news agency reported.

In January 2018, a Pegasus Boeing 737-800 slid down an embankment at Trabzon airport on the Black Sea, and landed just metres from the water with its wheels stuck in thick mud.

After four days, the plane was eventually lifted back onto the runway with engineers using cranes. All 162 passenger and six crew were safely evacuated.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought to make Istanbul the world's top aviation hub and in 2018 opened a new mega-airport in the city of 15 million people.

Pegasus, which has been flying for 20 years, has a fleet of 83 aircraft, including 47 Boeings and 36 Airbus planes, according to its website.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/plane-breaks-into-three-after-skidding-off-istanbul-runway-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/plane-breaks-into-three-after-skidding-off-istanbul-runway.html

243,06-2-20,Record breaking US astronaut returns to Earth: TV,"NASA's Christina Koch returned to Earth safely on Thursday having shattered the spaceflight record for female astronauts after almost a year aboard the International Space Station.

Koch touched down at 0912 GMT on the Kazakh steppe after 328 days in space along with Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency and Alexander Skvortsov of the Russian space agency.

Dmitry Rogozin, head of Russia's Roscosmos space agency, said the crew had returned safely.

""All is well on board, the crew are feeling well,"" Rogozin wrote on Twitter.

Koch, a 41-year-old Michigan-born engineer, beat the previous record for a single spaceflight by a woman -- 289 days, held by NASA veteran Peggy Whitson -- on December 28, 2019.

She had already made history by that point as one half of the first-ever all-woman spacewalk along with NASA counterpart Jessica Meir in October.

Koch told NBC on Tuesday that she would ""miss microgravity"" as she spoke to journalists ahead of the three-and-a-half hour journey back to Earth.

""It's really fun to be in a place where you can just bounce around between the ceiling and the floor whenever you want,"" she said, smiling as she twisted her body around the ISS.

Koch called three-time flyer Whitson ""a heroine of mine"" and a ""mentor"" in the space programme after she surpassed the 59-year-old's record.

She also spoke of her desire to ""inspire the next generation of explorers"".

Koch's return comes after an advert produced by the skincare brand Olay ran during an intermission in the American football Super Bowl with a call to ""make space for women"".

The advert featured NASA astronaut Nicole Stott and saw the company promise to donate up to $500,000 to the non-profit Women Who Code, which works with young women seeking careers in tech and scientific fields.

This year's Super Bowl was watched by over 100 million people while advert time costs more than USD 5 million for a 30-second commercial.

The first woman in space was Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova whose spaceflight in 1963 is still the only solo mission carried out by a woman.

But the cosmonauts Russia has sent to the ISS since expeditions began in 2000 have all been men with the exception of Yelena Serova's launch in 2014.

Both Tereshkova and Serova are now lawmakers in the Russian parliament, where they represent the ruling United Russia party.

Unlike Koch, whose stay aboard the ISS was extended, Parmitano and Skvortsov are rounding off regular six-month missions.

Parmitano handed over command of the ISS to Roscosmos' Oleg Skripochka on Tuesday.

The 43-year-old Italian posted regular shots of the Earth while aboard, highlighting the plight of the Amazon rainforest and describing the Alps as ""like a spinal column, never bending to time"".

Four male cosmonauts have spent a year or longer in space as part of a single mission with Valery Polyakov's 437 days the overall record.

Scott Kelly holds the record for a NASA astronaut, posting 340 days at the ISS before he returned home in 2016.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/record-breaking-us-astronaut-returns-to-earth--tv-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/record-breaking-us-astronaut-returns-to-earth--tv.html
244,06-2-20,No impact of T20I series' loss on ODI unit: Henry Nicholls,"New Zealand batsman Henry Nicholls on Thursday said the ODI squad did not carry the baggage of the T20 side which was blanked by India and that reflected in its highest run chase in 50-over cricket.

Riding on Ross Taylor's 21st hundred, the hosts chased down their highest total in ODIs on Wednesday to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. The second ODI will be played in Auckland on Saturday.

""We didn't feel it as part of the group coming in. So I wasn't feeling any pressure and there is no need to prove anything. It was a small ground and a big chase, so it was nice we were able to do that,"" Nicholls said in Auckland on Thursday.

""It was great, our biggest chase ever in ODI cricket and it was good to be able to contribute in it. In the past, playing India in India, we have had a couple of chases around the 300-mark and others we got close to. It was nice to do that again at home, and to actually win the game, it was great,"" he added.

Taylor smacked an unbeaten 109, with Tom Latham knocking 69 off 48 balls. Their partnership broke India's bowling strength in the middle overs. Nicholls paid rich tribute to the two senior batsmen.

""Having someone like that at number four, especially with Kane Williamson not being there as well, the experience he brings is immense. It is not just about the runs, because batting with him in the middle, you keep having those conversations that help your batting too.

""The dimensions of the ground helped us and he certainly likes batting there. It was a great partnership and great knock from him. Ross being there till the end to be not out and win the game was immense for us.""

On Lathham's knock, he said: ""Tom and I have played together for a long time, so I have certainly seen him play like that before. He is very versatile and adaptive to the game scenario and conditions. The way he started, well it was slow, 2 off 10 balls or something.

""But he managed to put the pressure back on Kuldeep (Yadav) and their other spinners. Being captain he led from the front and that partnership changed the game for us,” said Nicholls.

Seddon Park's dimensions came into sharp focus, as a shorter boundary on one side benefitted the chase. The second ODI will be played at Eden Park which has shorter boundaries still.

""The short boundary proved to be really important for us. There was some breeze as well in the evening. So whenever they bowled through the middle, or bowled short, we pushed back with boundaries.

""Their attacking bowlers couldn't bowl with the bigger boundary and it played into our hands. Ross managed it pretty well and again for Tom to come to the crease, and attack the way he did, it really changed the game.

""On a short ground, the credit goes to our bowlers who realized it could be a 360-370 score. But they kept it to a smaller score which could be chase down. For us as a batting unit, we know we can chase high scores on that small ground,"" said Nicholls.

The batsman said he will continue to open as long as the management wants, despite suggestion that Latham could move up top given his form.

""Opening is not too different. I am used to batting in a few different spots. I was opening a bit for Canterbury coming into this series. So I am trying to form a new partnership up top with Martin Guptill, and get those platforms in.

""I was disappointed to get out after a good start. But with Ross there and the way Tom started, I was confident we could get the chase done. In the end we only needed run-a-ball and it was the biggest factor for us to finish the game,"" he signed off.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-impact-of-t20i-series--loss-on-odi-unit--henry-nicholls-2020-02-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/no-impact-of-t20i-series--loss-on-odi-unit--henry-nicholls.html
