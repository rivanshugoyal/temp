7,08-3-20,Not good idea to leave Afghanistan in lurch,"The peace deal between the US and the Taliban, sans the involvement of the Afghan Government — purported to ensure US forces’ drawdown and the later ensuring no safe haven to radical Islamists on the Afghan soil — has, on the contrary, raised several uncertainties about what comes next in Afghanistan. One thing is certain, the Taliban will fill the vacuum and play Pakistan’s game

The hope of tranquillity returning to war-torn Afghanistan following the peace deal signed between the Taliban and the US, sans important stakeholder — the ruling Afghan Government — at the end of the last month has been dashed as the Taliban resumed attacks against Government forces after it declined to release Taliban prisoners.

Following nine rounds of discussions, the negotiators had reached the peace agreement that addresses four main issues: Ceasefire, withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan, intra-Afghan negotiations and finally, counter-terrorism assurances from the Taliban. The deal was signed by US Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the political chief of the Taliban Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, with the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as witness. It was concluded in Doha, the capital city of Qatar. After the agreement was signed, US President Donald Trump said, “I really believe the Taliban want to do something to show we’re not all wasting time. If bad things happen, we’ll go back with a force like no one’s ever seen.”

This precisely underlines that America is expecting a positive outcome from the truce. And if the Taliban leadership falters on its commitments, Washington would come with an extraordinary force to ensure the stability of Afghanistan.

America invaded Afghanistan weeks after the historic terror attack on its soil in September 11, 2001. This was the first ever such jihadist onslaught carried out in the US by the al-Qaeda, then based in Afghanistan. Since then the US-led NATO forces have been there to fight out the scourge of the Islamic fundamentalists mainly spearheaded by the al-Qaeda and directly supported by the Taliban regime (1996-2001) headed by Mullah Omar.

In this war to stamp out Islamists, the US has lost nearly 2,400 soldiers and about 12,000 are still stationed in Afghanistan. But then the offensive against the NATO forces was initially led by the Taliban fighters, and today, it is a multi-cornered campaign launched by other jihadists such as ISIS, al-Qaeda and Haqqani Network. And over the period of almost two decades, the two civilian Governments under Hamid Karzai and now Ashraf Ghani have not been able to establish full control all over the

country.

So far, the situation on the ground has not worsened, but has not improved qualitatively, both for the successive regimes in Kabul and most importantly for the ordinary Afghans. In such a situation, the next move on the part of Trump Administration in Afghanistan would definitely have a serious impact on the sustenance of the Ghani Government and normal civilian life across the country.

Should America withdraw from Afghanistan? Clearly, America should not leave or desert Afghanistan the way it is trying at the moment. Looking at the current imbroglio in the country and an emerging offensive of the Taliban on the backyard, Trump should not withdraw from Afghanistan.

In fact, it is now almost two long decades, the US forces are fighting a bloody war against the al-Qaeda, Taliban and finally ISIS insurgencies across the war-torn nation.

Another question arises to the international community: Is ISIS growing at the cost of the current stand-off among the Taliban, the US and the Ghani Government? To a great extent, yes it is. Time has come for the Taliban leadership to fight out both the al-Qaeda and ISIS menace, else its very identity would be vanished from the Afghan soil. As the traditional strongholds of both these groups are fast obliterating, they are either searching for new grounds or fighting to survive wherever they were existing earlier. For the al-Qaeda, Afghanistan is considered to be its breeding ground as once Osama bin Laden had a strong tie-up with the Taliban regime. Since the killing of Osama and its top leadership at the hands of US-led global coalition known as “global war on terrorism”, the group had to literally look for both its existence and relevance. On the other hand, the ISIS was born from the very womb of the al-Qaeda, but it has gradually lost its roots and set out a complete new journey for redefining Islamic radicalism.

However the joint operation of the US and its allies in West Asia, particularly in Iraq and Syria, and the birth of the united forces, brought forth by the Syrian Government, Russia and Iran-backed militia, have dealt a death blow to the ISIS. So at this juncture, resettling differences within the Taliban factions and immediately reclaiming their lost command could be a top priority simply to prevent further undermining its strength.

Obviously, since the Taliban have not been in power after 2001, the cadre hardly have any hope of regaining Kabul. However, with the signing of the much awaited peace deal with the US, and also on conditions favourable to their main demands, the Islamists and their current leadership have seen a new road to Afghanistan’s power corridor. At the moment, the peace deal just meant sidelining the Ghani regime. But in future, who knows he may meet the same fate Najibullah met on September 28, 1996, that ensued in the Taliban snatching power.

However, against all odds, one can hope the current Government will have enough might to fight back any such monstrous attempt by Baradar. The heaviest onslaught of the war would be encountered by the Afghan National Army. They have to deal with the rag-tag insurgents, apart from the high-handed and most violent Taliban. Therefore, instead of fulminating against the Ghani Government, both Abudullah Abdullah and Rashid Dostum (currently threatening to form their own governments) must come along to strengthen the status quo. Else all of them will have to face a resurgent Taliban very soon. Their differences would be fully exploited by Baradar.

How India should respond at this juncture? This time formally, India has become a part of the Taliban talk process in Qatar, represented by its Ambassador in Doha P Kumaran. Earlier in November 2018, two Indian diplomats, former Indian envoys to Afghanistan and Pakistan respectively Amar Sinha and TCA Raghavan, participated in talks with the Taliban, simply as observers.

Traditionally, India has shied away from engaging with the Taliban leadership, though many realists in the foreign policy domain have demanded the country’s active participation in the Afghan peace process.

But this time with the Trump-Taliban agreement, Delhi has recalibrated its position with a cautious note. India has always insisted on its role in development and security assistance in Afghanistan. Frankly speaking, an Afghan-led, and an Afghan-owned deal could be possible, but an Afghan-controlled one is near impossible. The reason behind this is that all the truce agreements or discussions were either led by influential players such as the US or may have been complicated by the presence of Pakistan.

Apart from India’s interaction with the US, it has also been in touch with other major players in Afghanistan such as Russia, China, Iran and Saudi Arabia for quite some time.

However, a new Taliban coming back to power would certainly remind India of its dark memories of the 1990s, particularly of the hijacking of the IC-814 and its aftermath, leading to the release of Masood Azhar and the establishment of his Jaish-e-Muhammed. Later this group was involved in the Parliament attack in 2001 and in Pulwama attack in 2019. For Delhi, Taliban’s retake of the nation would mean strengthening Pakistan’s sinister Islamist terror design against India.

Thus since the beginning of the talks led by the US, Russia and China, the Indian Government has been stressing on the involvement of all sections of Afghan society and the legitimately elected Government of Ghani, to respect the constitutional legacy and political mandate and finally, not to offer any ungoverned spaces where terrorists and their proxies can be relocated in that country.

These three aspects clearly indicate how India wants a future Afghanistan deal look like. In the recent past, Delhi has suffered and lost both man and material in the hands of Af-Pak based terror groups. Therefore, its major concern is not to have space left for the relocation of radicals such as the al-Qaeda, the ISIS and the Haqqani network. Rather they all must be moved out of Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Lashkar-e-Tayyeba, the Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Jamaat-ud-Dawa kinds of Pakistan-based jihadi organisations should not be offered a safe haven in Afghanistan.

It seems Afghanistan would turn into another chaos sooner or later. The main reason behind it is that Washington has never ever emphasised on involving the Ghani regime in the peace process. The Taliban has been encouraged to sidestep the popularly elected Government in the country, it has dealt with America and the rest of the major international players in Afghanistan as the sole representative of the country. It would be prepared to run a parallel set of Government.

Now only the reconciliation process between the Ghani regime and the Taliban would start wherein many tricky issues would arise like prisoner swap arrangements.

Finally, what the peace deal has achieved is a relative calm for the war-ravaged Afghanistan at the moment. And the central to the deal is the drawdown of the US forces from Afghan soil and guarantees from the Taliban that the country will not be used as safe haven for terrorists. However, the bigger challenge would be negotiating an agreement between the Taliban and the Ghani Government on the future of the country.

8,08-3-20,CAA protest is Muslims' pent-up ire against Modi,"The Muslim community, in short, viewed the course of politics since 2014 as a series of defeats. Determination to reacquire political relevance found expression in the anti-CAA stir, aided and abetted by those who had other political scores to settle with the Modi Government

There are two very conflicting versions of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act movement that are doing the rounds. Both need dispassionate scrutiny if we are to anticipate the future trends in Indian politics.

The first narrative would have us believe that the anti-CAA stir is essentially an uprising of civil society against a bid by the Narendra Modi Government to steer India towards a majoritarian state. According to this point of view, the CAA may seem innocuous at first glance but in effect prepares the groundwork for relegating Muslims to the status of second-class citizens. Although the way this argument has been translated into political messaging in the grassroots would suggest that Indian Muslims must henceforth prove their Indian citizenship with documentation, the more sophisticated of the anti-CAA concede that there is nothing in the laws for the state to undertake such a draconian exercise. Their contention is that it could happen and a pre-emptive strike to negate all discriminatory practices is imperative.

The second feature of this narrative is that the anti-CAA stir is presented as an uprising of civil society and includes a wide cross-section of society. In particular, it is held that students, Dalit organisations and all minority communities are involved in defeating the Modi Government’s project. It is also being held that the CAA is against the tenets of the Constitution and will be struck down by the Supreme Court after the hearings resume in April.

Initially, the parliamentary opposition was slow to react to the CAA. The hearings of the Select Committee weren’t marked by too much acrimony — although dissenting notes were submitted. The Opposition believed that the main opposition to the CAA would happen in Assam and the North-eastern States and would be linked to the pre-existing disquiet against outsiders and all foreigners — Hindus and Muslims. The Opposition felt that the real pressure on the Government would come from these areas and that the rest of the country would be largely unaffected. Certainly, there was no anticipation that the Muslim community would react so adversely to a legislation that was aimed at benefitting small communities of refugees. In hindsight, the Opposition has merely piggy-backed on a movement that has been initiated and nurtured by community organisations.

The alternative narrative presented by the Modi Government sees the CAA as attending to a long-standing issue centred on the loose ends of Partition. It has proceeded on the assumption that while illegal immigration from Bangladesh is difficult to contain, the issue would become more manageable and politically rewarding if a distinction could be made between refugees who had fled from religious persecution and those who had entered India for other regions. If the refugees were driven by a push factor, the infiltrators were pulled towards India by economic considerations.

Underlying this distinction between refugees and infiltrators was the unstated conviction that India was the natural homeland for all Hindus. The CAA, in effect, guaranteed a right of return to all Hindus of the subcontinent. Coming to the anti-CAA stir, the Government too was taken by surprise when Muslim protests erupted all over West Bengal on December 13 — two days after Parliament passed the Bill — and quickly spread to the Muslim-dominated campuses of Aligarh and Jamia Milia Islamia, Delhi. Hostile demonstrations were anticipated in Assam and the North-eastern States and the Government was prepared to meet these with a combination of persuasion and firmness. There does not appear to have been any corresponding strategy for the protests in the rest of India. Once the protests escalated, the narrative of the BJP and the Government shifted focus to the composition of the protests. The Government was always clear in its mind on two things.

First, that the composition of the demonstrations and the geography of the protests clearly indicated that it was a pre-planned Muslim uprising.

Secondly, it was also felt that the CAA was incidental to the protests. The Muslim community, it was felt, was smarting over the fact that in two successive general elections, the BJP and Narendra Modi had coasted to outright victory without any Muslim support. Modi had not only undermined the political clout of the Muslim community; he had added to the insult by enacting three laws that many Muslims felt were inimical to their community interests. The first was the triple talaq legislation, the first time Muslim personal laws were altered since 1940. The second was the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir, a long-standing BJP election commitment that the pundits felt could never be implemented. Thirdly, there was the CAA which clearly distinguished between Hindu refugees and Muslim infiltrators. In principle, by stating that those who were deemed illegal immigrants were ineligible for citizenship, the CAA has left the door open for deportation of foreigners. The CAA also ruled out the possibility of India granting any form of asylum to Muslim Rohingyas fleeing Bangladesh. Finally, the simmering disquiet over the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya case was waiting to find an outlet.

The Muslim community, in short, viewed the course of politics since 2014 as a series of defeats. The determination to reacquire political relevance found expression in the anti-CAA stir, aided and abetted by those who had other political scores to settle with the Modi Government.

What is being witnessed in today’s India is a sharply polarised environment based on two very different narratives. India is actually witnessing a sharply ideological division which won’t easily be resolved.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/caa-protest-is-muslims--pent-up-ire-against-modi.html

Patnaik named Subash Singh, Chairperson of Odisha Building & Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board; Munna Khan, Advisor to Minorities Affairs department; Sujit Kumar, Advisor to Special Development Council; and Mamata Mahanta, BJD Mahila wing member, Mayurbhanj, as the party nominees.

Besides, the Chief Minister also appointed former Brahmapur MLA Ramesh Chandra Chaupatnaik as the Chairman of Odisha Building & Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board replacing Subash Singh.

Notably, the terms of four Rajya Sabha member from the State, Anubhav Mohanty, Narendra Kumar Swain, Sarojini Hembram (all BJD) and Ranjib Biswal (Congress) will expire on April 2, 2020. Ahead of completion of their tenure, elections will be held to fill up the vacancies.

By announcing the four candidates, Patnaik has repeated representation of a tribal woman in the Upper House of Parliament. In this respect, Mamata Mahanta would replace Sarojini Hembrum, also from Mayurbhanj.

Besides, Patnaik has played a minority card this time by nominating Munna Khan.

Patnaik’s move in fielding BJD candidates for all the four seats put in rest the speculations that like in the last Rajya Sabha polls, he might concede a seat to the BJP.

The BJD has enough strength in the State Assembly to send three candidates to the Rajya Sabha.

23,08-3-20,Crimes against women: Odisha 2nd worst in country,"Twenty-five years after the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action setting out a clear path on how to achieve gender equality, the world has witnessed remarkable progress.

However, a report of the UN Secretary-General points out that violence against women and girls remains pervasive.

The speakers who attended a meeting here on Saturday to celebrate in advance the International Women’s Day (March 8) organised by the Atmashakti Trust, the Mahila Shramajeebi Manch and the Odisha Shramajeebee Manch, expressed concern over the alarming rise in cases of crimes against women, including domestic violence, in Odisha, making it the second worst State in the country.

Odisha contributes to about 3 per cent of India’s population but, with 94.5 cases of crime against women per lakh people, the State also contributed to 5.6 per cent of all crimes against women in 2017. It ranks as the second-worst State in the country on this front, as per the data released by National Crime Record Bureau report, 2017.

The data further disclose that the female literacy rate in the State is 67.4 percent. By the time girls turn 15, their school attendance drops to 63 per cent. Therefore, the State Government must prioritise efforts to ensure an equitable and a rightful place for girls and women of our State, opined the experts.

According to NFHS 4, just 46.5 per cent of women aged 15-49 years in Odisha own land alone or jointly with someone. The ownership of individual land holdings by women is even more meagre in Odisha. Mere 3.3 per cent of women in Odisha own individual land holdings and out of the total individual land holdings owned by women 74.8 per cent was marginal land holdings

Odisha’s performance on gender equality (SDG 5) is still in the aspirant category. This means there is need for more focus and support to increase gender equality by empowering women and girls in various spheres of life and reducing gender-based violence.

Even as Odisha has made significant improvement in education indicators, there is still considerable distance to cover in terms of achieving gender parity in access to education. Median years of schooling in Odisha for females (4 years) are lower than males.

Among others, Executive Trustee, Atmashakti Trust, Ruchi Kashyap, gender specialist Henarani Nayak, and leaders from Mahila Shramajeebi Manch, Odisha and Odisha Shramajeebee Manch were present.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/crimes-against-women--odisha-2nd-worst-in-country.html

40,08-3-20,"SUN, SAND, WATERFALLS, FORESTS, FOOD...AND WHAT NOT","The time I made a plan for a family trip to Goa, my friends mocked. One said it’s a couple’s thing…some said you should go with friends. Let me be clear, Goa is a place which hypnotises you and makes you fall in love with it, no matter whether you are with your family, kids, husband, boyfriend or girlfriend, alone or on a honeymoon.

There are myriads of activities and adventures where a two-year-old to 60-year-old can equally enjoy. I was travelling with my parents, husband and with my two and half-year-old son. It was more than a trip as my son (Swastik aka Elvi) was going to visit his Dada, Dadi with his Nana and Nani. My in-laws reside at Savarde, 30km far from Madgaon in South Goa.

We boarded Rajdhani in February from Hazrat Nizamuddin and reached Madgaon the next day. The 26-hour journey was like rowing gently down the stream and the journey was sort of a dream. After Panvel, breathtaking secenes awaited me on the Konkan Railway. Chugging through 92 tunnels and on 2,000 bridges, this route gives you postcard-worthy moments every five seconds with endless stretches of water, hills, paddy hues and villages under shades of coconut trees.

My father-in-law was waiting to receive us at Madgaon Railway station on the newly built platform. As soon as Elvi saw his Dadajee he ran to him and embraced him. In a 20 minutes drive from Madgaon railway station to my rented house at Savarde, Xeldem in Quepem, I explored colourful, vibrant and serene Goa. Our car was cruising at 60 kmph. The blue, yellow, purple, red, orange, green coloured houses made up a cheerful locality. Portuguese style villas and churches gave pleasure to my eyes. We reached the house and its beauty left me spellbound. It was in the middle of nature and was surrounded by varieties of trees— Coconut, Cashew, Mango, Curry Patta, Jack Fruit, Chiko, Papaya, Banana, Drumstick and etc. For the first time I saw cashew-laden trees. The boundry of house was decked with flowers like Rose, Marigold, Guldabdi, Dalia, Gazelia, Aurhul, etc. My in-laws resides on first floor and the landlords stay in the house next to them.

I was so amazed by the beauty of the surroundings that I forgot my mother-in-law was eagerly waiting to see us. We entered the house and it had a temple like feel. The place was clean, tidy and spacious with a pleasant smell of food and flowers. The 26-hour long journey satisfied my soul but it couldn’t satisfy my grumbling stomach. My mother-in-law cooked delicious vegetarian lunch for us and our landlady also cooked Soya Goan chap for us. The taste was different with a sweat and salty flavour.

In the evening we were enjoying the panoramic view of hills and forests from the balcony. The atmosphere was very peaceful and refreshing. Meanwhile, our landlady came to us and offered sweat potato pakora with tea. It was awesome in taste. Goans are very warm and hearty.

After that we went for a walk in the clean and clear air. In the nights, sky had more visible stars and decipherable constellations. The roads were lined with coconut trees.

Goan houses have a typical architecture, different from other cities. Tiled roofs, pillars, seats in the balcony, trees.... all form part of the house. One important must-have in the compound near the entrance was a sign of religion. Christians had crosses and Hindus had a splendid Tulsi Chaura.

One drawback of course is the absence of Uber or Ola, forcing us to pay exorbitant amounts to the private taxies.

Next morning, I woke up by a honking sound. I rushed to the balcony and saw a Poder (a traditional baker), who comes on a cycle everyday to sell fresh bread. Life here starts very early in the morning. I could not refrain myself from a morning walk and went with my husband. Coconut trees and colourful old style Portuguese villas were all around. Goa also has a vast network of backwaters that runs through many villages. So, you can either go fishing on the banks of the backwaters or just chill there in the daytime.

We returned back and got ready for our road trip to North Goa. We had a yummy Neer dosa in breakfast, cooked by our landlady. My mother-in-law had already hired a cab and the driver was on time at 8 am. He was familiar to us and promised to take us to the unexplored sites. Instead of heading towards North Goa, he insisted that we visit Mahadev temple first. We all were least interested but agreed. We reached the temple soon and it was just a treat to the eyes. Tambdi Surla Temple is located inside the area of Bhagwan Mahavir National Park. Situated amidst nature, it is a divine place. The place was unbelievably quiet. You can only hear the sound of the stream and the chirping of birds when you are on the temple premises. The location was so pristine that one would definitely love to visit the temple not once but several times. I thanked Sanjay, the driver for bringing us here.

Mahadeva Temple, Tambdi Surla is a 13th-century Shaivite temple dedicated to Lord Shiva and an active place of Hindu worship. It has been said that it is the only structural temple of the Kadamba period to survive the destructive violence of religious intolerance during Muslim and Portuguese occupations of Goan territory. The intricate carvings of the temple adorn the interior and sides of the temple. Along with Lord Shiva, the temple has fascinating figures of Lord Vishnu and Brahma. Every corner of the temple tells a story. Tambdi Surla faces east so that the rays of the rising sun first fall on the deity.

We headed towards the sound of stream flowing down the hills. We went down and put our legs into the water. It was so relaxing. A number of small fishes touched our legs as we spent an hour there. We had some snacks and lime water there. From there we went to The Basilica of Bom Jesus church, one of the oldest church of Goa. Built in the year 1594 and consecrated in 1605, the building of this church coincides with the beginning of Christianity in India. It is known for its exemplary baroque architecture.

Now it’s already 2:30 pm and we were hungry. Sanjay took us to the restaurant. There we had Goan Prawn Curry. It is also called Ambot Tik. Crunchy prawn dipped into smooth curry. It went perfectly with steamed rice. We ordered chicken kurma biryani and few more Goan cuisines. We all had a truly satisfying and awesome meal in Rs 2,700. After that my mom went on a shopping spree. From there we headed towards the Miramar beach in Panjim. Not scared of the huge waves, my son enjoyed a lot and soaked himself in sand, playing with high tide.

Meanwhile, my husband came and asked us to get ready for the 2-hour cruise ride. It sounded so exciting. Soon, we all on boarded the cruise. We were welcomed by our captain who was sitting in the middle of the cruise and narrating us about the famous things around the coastal areas of Miramar beach and the Arabian Sea as well. I immediately took a corner seat facing sea. Snacks, food items, and beverages were also available on the cruise which we had to pay on the spot. As the cruise was sailing away from Miramar beach and heading towards the sea, we spotted astounding dolphins swimming in synchronicity.

The cruise also offered glimpses of the nearby villages, island, churches and farms adding a rustic feel to this experience. The centuries old temples, Chopar forts and church, jail were a sight to remember, charming all the tourists on the cruise. Along with sightseeing there was live DJ on board who kept us entertaining. A Group of people were dancing.

Meanwhile, I noticed that the sky was changing its colour in every minute. We were entering twilight time. The sun, a fiery orb, was gradually drowning into the sea at the farthest end. Shades of different colours -- red, orange, yellow spread all over in the sky. It was breathtakingly beautiful, and I was overwhelmed as I stood before this magnificent sight. And the burning orb finally disappeared into the Arabian Sea. I have never seen such a beautiful sunset before. Everything was very relaxing and serene. The cold breeze, colourful sky, flocking birds, dolphins, sea water, green hills all were just like a soothing song which I wished to be continued forever. But nothing lasts forever. Soon, we were on the sea shore with an exhilarating and serene experience. I was sure everyone was overwhelmed by this grandeur sea sailing.

While returning I noticed peace, calm on everyone’s face as they appeared delved into the moments that they just came across. We had a wonderful dinner at the market place on the way to our home. Again, I was in the majestic home and collecting my memories that I had in the day.

Next morning, I woke up again by the honking sound but preferred to sleep due to muscle contractions in the foot. It must be due to the continuous walk and running on the beach. We decided to take a break and though my father-in-law. woke up early and was ready for the office. A resident engineer in Konkan railway project, he is an inspiration and demonstrates a zeal to keep oneself fit, energetic and active even in his old age. We discussed our itinerary for the next day and decided to visit the tough trek to Dudhsagar waterfall.

My mother, husband, son and me geared up for our next spot—Dudhsagar fall. We reached at Colem and from where we hired a jeep. The jeep safari which would begin at Colem where we would be driven through verdant forest areas with meandering streams along the way. In spite of the bumps and jerks along the way it was a picturesque journey towards the four-tiered Dudhsagar waterfall. The drive would take forty-five minutes to reach there and then a km of trek in the lap of nature. With all ups and downs, we finally reached Dudhsagar waterfalls. It was like a heaven on Earth. The gushing streams of this waterfall made it appear as if milk was flowing from the hills and hence the name. The sight of this gorgeous waterfall and its surroundings mesmerized me and made my day. The glory of the Dudhsagar falls, lush greenery and the scenic beauty of this place overwhelmed me.

We went closer to the falls and a natural pool formed at the base of the waterfall and we couldn’t refrain from taking a dip in the pool which had a large number of big fishes. My son was thrilled to see fishes swimming all around. After trekking, a dip in the pool rejuvenated my senses. This waterfall pool was not too deep and not too shallow either. We were taking extra care at the sides because the rock formations around the pool were slippery. The beauty of the crystal clear water in the middle of lush greenery was breathtaking.

I don’t have adjectives to explain the beauty of this place and it can only be felt. I want to be here again and again. It’s difficult for me to pen my Goa experience in limited words. After that we went to many beeches—Palolem, Colva, Bagha, etc. and had wonderful candle light dinner on the beach. We tasted excellent sea food there with Pina colada mocktail.

Goa is not only all about sand, beeches, sea, temples, churches but it is more than that. It captivates life.

After seeing this majestic place all your restlessness, humdrums of life will end. It will give you real moksha, though temporary. The whole Goa trip to me was like my childhood painting which has turned into reality.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sun--sand--waterfalls--forests--food---and-what-not.html

47,08-3-20,Budget Session adjourned,"The Budget Session of Uttarakhand Assembly was adjourned till March 25 on Saturday. The absence of the Ministers and BJP MLAs prompted the Congress members to attack the Government.

Inside the house, the leader of opposition (LoP) Indira Hridayesh mounted a scathing attack on the BJP Government for absence of Ministers.

She said BJP Ministers, including the Chief Minister and BJP MLAs have fled from Bharadisain within 48 hours of declaration of summer capital status to Gairsain.

Outside the house, the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Pritam Singh said that all the Ministers barring the parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik are ‘absconding’ from Assembly on the fifth day which shows their seriousness and attitude towards Gairsain.

He said all 11 MLAs of Congress are present in the assembly while very few BJP MLAs are present in Gairsain. Singh added that the Congress is in favour of making Gairsain permanent capital of Uttarakhand. The absence of many MLAs from house on Friday evening gave the chance to the Congress party to take pot shots on the Government.

There came a time on Friday evening when there were more Congress MLAs than BJP MLAs in the house.

This unnerved the BJP leaders and frantic calls were made to the MLAs to come to the house. On Saturday also only 27 MLAs of BJP out of 57 were present in the house while parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik was the only Minister who was present in the House.

In business of the house, the members of the treasury benches and the Opposition participated in discussion on the Budget.

Congress MLAs Mamta Rakesh, Qazi Nizamuddin, Manoj Rawat and Raj Kumar termed the Budget anti-people. BJP MLA, Munna Singh Chauhan termed the budget as one of the best the state has ever seen.

48,08-3-20,Circle rate complaints to be addressed in 15 days,"Parliamentary Affairs and Urban Development Minister Madan Kaushik has assured that all complaints about the circle rates would be addressed within 15 days.

The Minister was responding to the concerns of the Congress members on the hike in circle rates in the State Assembly on Saturday.

Raising the issue under rule 58 in the Assembly, the Leader of Opposition (LoP), Indira Hridayesh said Government has increased circle rates arbitrarily.

She said increase in circle rates has resulted in cessation in the process of new registrations which is causing a big revenue loss to the State exchequer.

Hridayesh added at many places the circle rates have become higher than the market rates. She demanded that the Government should set up a high powered committee to look into the anomalies in circle rates.

Chakrata MLA Pritam Singh said circle rates have been hiked by 300 to 500 per cent by the present Government.

Brushing aside the charges of the Congress, Madan Kaushik said the State Government has increased the circle rates after a gap of two years and the rates were revised after a proper study.

He said there were various anomalies in the circle rates and they were removed by use of satellite survey.

“The anomalies came into fore when the compensation of land acquired for rail and road projects was given to farmers. For example, the circle rate on one side of river in Srinagar was Rs 143 per square metre while on other side it was Rs 891. This anomaly was removed in the new circle rates,’’ he said.

The Minister added 21 to 25 per cent rates were increased only in two percent of area and on an average only 15 per cent increase has occurred in circle rates.

He claimed that between January 13 and March 6, 2019, a total 30,587 land registries were done and in the corresponding period this year 32,481 registers have been done which shows that the allegation of opposition is not true.

He however assured that all complaints will be addressed by the Government within 15 days.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/circle-rate-complaints-to-be-addressed-in-15-days.html

59,08-3-20,"Parted ways with BJP, not Hindutva: Uddhav Donates Rs 1 cr for Ram temple","Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said in Ayodhya on Saturday that his party’s former ally Bharatiya Janata Party was not synonymous with ‘Hindutva’ and his party had parted ways with the BJP and not Hindutva.

Visiting Ayodhya to mark completion of his government’s 100 days in office on Saturday, Thackeray also announced a donation of Rs 1 crore for the upcoming Ram temple. He was accompanied by his wife Rashmi Thackeray and son Aditya Thackeray.

“Main BJP se alag hua hun, Hindutva se nahi. BJP ka matlab Hindutva nahi hai. Hindutva alag hai, BJP alag hai,” the Shiv Sena chief said on exiting the 35-year-old alliance with the BJP.

“Shiv Sena has its belief deeply rooted in Hindutva and should be seen separately from the BJP. It’s the BJP that has drifted away from Hindutva . I (Shiv Sena) am separate from the BJP, not from Hindutva,” Thackeray said.

The Maharashtra chief minister remarked, “I have come to know that the bank account of the Temple Trust has become operational in Ayodhya only yesterday. I want to humbly say that I am donating Rs 1 crore for the formation of Ram temple from my trust and not the government exchequer.”

“I spoke to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday. A grand Ram temple will definitely be built and we all will build it. I want to request Yogiji to give us a piece of land to construct Maharashtra Bhawan to facilitate Ram bhakts coming from Maharashtra,” he said.

Mentioning that this was his third visit to Ayodhya in the last 18 months, Thackeray recalled that Shiv Sena had asked the government to pass a law to construct Ram temple but it did not happen.

Thackeray cherished the fact that both the Ayodhya judgement and his taking over as chief minister of Maharashtra happened in November, 2019, exactly a year after visiting Ayodhya.

The Maharashtra chief minister further said, “I have once again come for the darshan of Ram Lalla with my saffron family. I will keep coming here and perform aarti on the Saryu river banks.”

Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had confirmed in January that the Maharashtra chief minister would visit Ayodhya to seek blessings of Lord Rama.

60,08-3-20,BJP likely to announce candidates by Holi,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is likely to announce the names of its candidates for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections before Holi, a party office bearer in the thick of events said on Saturday. While several veteran leaders are among the potential choices for the ticket to the Upper House of the Parliament, the party is also looking at some new faces, he added.

“The candidates can be announced any day. Our senior leaders have been pondering over the probable candidates and the announcement is likely to be made before Holi,” said BJP Spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo.

Former Chief Minister Raghubar Das, former BJP State President Ravindra Rai and newly-elected State President Deepak Prakash are among the frontrunners for the candidature, a senior party office bearer said. While rumours are rife that Das will be sent to Rajya Sabha by the NDA, the former CM is yet to give consent for his candidature, he added.

Rai was also one of the choices for the position of BJP’s State President earlier this year. The two-time MP was replaced by a tribal face in the BJP in 2014. Deepak Prakash, on the other hand, got elected as the State President of the party in Jharkhand recently. He, however, may not be a choice for the Rajya Sabha elections as he has already been handed over responsibility of running the party in the State, sources said.

Elections will be held for two of six Rajya Sabha seats in Jharkhand, currently occupied by BJP’s Parimal Nathwani and RJD’s Premchand Gupta, this year. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced that the elections for the two seats in Jharkhand will be held on March 26. The notification for the elections will be issued on March 6 and March 13 will be the last date for filing nominations. The nominations will be scrutinized on March 16 and candidates can withdraw their nomination by March 18.

While the BJP is still weighing its options, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has unanimously backed party patriarch Shibu Soren for the Rajya Sabha. The Congress party, an ally of the JMM in the current Government, however, has remained tight-lipped on the matter.

The three-time Chief Minister is looked up to by all members of the political fraternity here irrespective of party lines and ideologies. However, the 76-year-old is battling health concerns due to ageing and has been frail lately, sources from the party said.

The BJP is the second largest party in the State Assembly. It has 26 legislators. On the other hand, JMM has 29 seats in the 81-member Assembly, while Congress party has 16 seats. The third partner in the Government, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), has only one legislator in Jharkhand.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-likely-to-announce-candidates-by-holi.html

In 2018, Shivpal had parted ways with the SP, founded by his elder brother Mulayam Singh Yadav, after 26 years of association due to a bitter fall out with party chief and his nephew Akhilesh Yadav and cousin Ram Gopal Yadav.

During his visit to Firozabad to meet former SP legislator Azim Bhai at the district jail on Friday, Shivpal said that there was no dispute within the family.

“There can be an understanding with Samajwadi Party over seats for 2022 assembly polls. The election symbol will, however, be ours which is a ‘key’,” he said.

Shivpal Yadav was the PWD and Irrigation minister in Samajwadi Party government headed by Akhilesh Yadav.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shivpal-yadav-hints-at-understanding-with-sp-for-2022-up-polls.html
68,08-3-20,Govt move to take over Jauhar Varsity,"There seems to be no end of troubles for beleaguered Samajwadi Party’s Lok Sabha member from Rampur, Mohammad Azam Khan, as the state government has initiated the process for taking over Jauhar University promoted by him.

The MP is also the Chancellor of Jauhar University, his son Abdullah Azam the CEO and wife Tazeen Fatma the trustee.

At present, Azam Khan along with his wife Tazeen Fatma and son Abdullah are lodged in Sitapur jail for forging Abdullah’s birth certificate.

Rampur’s District Magistrate AK Singh has submitted a report to the state government, recommending the takeover of Jauhar University by the government.

The university is required to submit its annual progress report every year in April but it has never submitted any report to the district magistrate since its inception.

“The university should be allowed to function in the present form and the government should take over its management,” the district magistrate said in his report.

The university was granted minority status by then officiating UP Governor Aziz Qureshi in December 2014.

Earlier, the Rampur district magistrate had set up a committee to enquire into the affairs of the university. The inquiry revealed several financial irregularities and violation of terms and conditions on which the university was given exemption from stamp duty and also government land.

As per report by the nine-member committee of the Rampur district administration, 36 hectare out of Jauhar University’s 78 hectare land was given by the state government. It said that more than Rs 88 crore of the total Rs 163 crore spent to construct the university was given by the state government. Moreover, the land owned by a charitable trust was exempted as long as the land value was less than Rs 12.5 crore.

In addition, the officials claimed that the management of Jauhar University duped students by charging more fees than it was authorised.

Earlier in July, 2019, the UP assembly had passed the UP Private Universities Bill, 2019, bringing 27 private universities, including Maulana Jauhar University in Rampur, under its regulatory control.

The law provides for appointment of an administrator by the state government if financial irregularities are detected.

The Samajwadi Party had opposed the bill saying it was an attempt to subjugate private universities by official interference which would affect the quality of teaching there.

The SP was particularly against provision in the bill that if any anti-national activity was carried out on university campus, action would be initiated against its administration.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-move-to-take-over-jauhar-varsity.html

Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said in Ayodhya on Saturday that his party’s former ally Bharatiya Janata Party was not synonymous with ‘Hindutva’ and his party had parted ways with the BJP and not Hindutva.

Visiting Ayodhya to mark completion of his government’s 100 days in office on Saturday, Thackeray also announced a donation of Rs 1 crore for the upcoming Ram temple. He was accompanied by his wife Rashmi Thackeray and son Aditya Thackeray.

“Main BJP se alag hua hun, Hindutva se nahi. BJP ka matlab Hindutva nahi hai. Hindutva alag hai, BJP alag hai,” the Shiv Sena chief said on exiting the 35-year-old alliance with the BJP.

“Shiv Sena has its belief deeply rooted in Hindutva and should be seen separately from the BJP. It’s the BJP that has drifted away from Hindutva . I (Shiv Sena) am separate from the BJP, not from Hindutva,” Thackeray said.

The Maharashtra chief minister remarked, “I have come to know that the bank account of the Temple Trust has become operational in Ayodhya only yesterday. I want to humbly say that I am donating Rs 1 crore for the formation of Ram temple from my trust and not the government exchequer.”

“I spoke to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday. A grand Ram temple will definitely be built and we all will build it. I want to request Yogiji to give us a piece of land to construct Maharashtra Bhawan to facilitate Ram bhakts coming from Maharashtra,” he said.

Mentioning that this was his third visit to Ayodhya in the last 18 months, Thackeray recalled that Shiv Sena had asked the government to pass a law to construct Ram temple but it did not happen.

Thackeray cherished the fact that both the Ayodhya judgement and his taking over as chief minister of Maharashtra happened in November, 2019, exactly a year after visiting Ayodhya.

The Maharashtra chief minister further said, “I have once again come for the darshan of Ram Lalla with my saffron family. I will keep coming here and perform aarti on the Saryu river banks.”

Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had confirmed in January that the Maharashtra chief minister would visit Ayodhya to seek blessings of Lord Rama. Raut had also said that Shiv Sena wanted alliance leaders to also come along.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/parted-ways-with-bjp-not-hindutva--uddhav.html

In 2018, Shivpal had parted ways with the SP, founded by his elder brother Mulayam Singh Yadav, after 26 years of association due to a bitter fall out with party chief and his nephew Akhilesh Yadav and cousin Ram Gopal Yadav.

During his visit to Firozabad to meet former SP legislator Azim Bhai at the district jail on Friday, Shivpal said that there was no dispute within the family.

“There can be an understanding with Samajwadi Party over seats for 2022 assembly polls. The election symbol will, however, be ours which is a ‘key’,” he said.

73,08-3-20,"State ophthalmologist wages war against blindness, cervical cancer","It’s not just Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Deepika Kumari and a handful of sports persons that are synonymous with Jharkhand. The State with abundant natural resources, flora and fauna, also have some unsung heroes and s-heroes, who have been tirelessly working for the society without the lust of fame and recognition.

Meet Dr Bharti Kashyap (52), co-founder and Medical Director of Kashyap Memorial Eye Hospital and eye bank trust as well as chair person of women doctor’s wing IMA, Jharkhand, has waged a war against vision loss and cervical cancer among women, especially those who do not have access to medical facilities in far flung naxal affected areas of the tribal State.

Noted ophthalmologist of the State, Dr Bharti Kashyap, has to her credit the first post humus eye donation and the first free cornea transplant of the then unified Bihar and Jharkhand in 1995. She founded first active eye bank of Bihar Jharkhand, Kashyap Memorial Eye Bank which has so far successfully carried out 482 cornea transplants, all free of charge.

Over the past 14 years, through innovative Run for Vision and now Blindfolded Marathons 2018 and 2019, Dr Kashyap has helped break the taboo of organ donation, encouraging people and families to come forward to pledge their eyes and donate eyes of deceased family members.

Between 2007 and 2018, Dr Kashyap has more than 20 Lakh children enrolled in Government run schools all over Jharkhand. Thousands of children, who at one stage, had dropped out of schools due to undetected and untreated high glass power cataracts, are now happily back at their schools, after being provided free eye glasses, cataract removal surgery and world class eye care at Kashyap Memorial Eye Hospital, Ranchi and through free eye screening and refraction and cataract surgery camps with premium iol implantation all free of cost.

Her beneficiaries also include victims of child trafficking, spastic children, diabetics, old age home residents, spastics, newspaper hawkers, daily wages workers, railway station porters, primitive tribes and people residing in the more difficult terrains of Jharkhand

Notably, since 2014, as Chairperson of Indian Medical Association, Women Doctors Wing, Jharkhand Chapter, Dr Kashyap has been waging a war against cervical cancer, the second most common cause of death of women of India, by organising free cervical cancer screening camps in tribal areas of Jharkhand educating women on nutrition, genital hygiene, multiple pregnancies and evils of pushing their girl child into early marriages

Due to her continuous campaigns, 11 out of 23 Sadar Hospitals of Jharkhand in Santhal Parganas, Ranchi, Koderma, Giridih, Khunti and Hazaribagh have been equipped with cervical pre cancer detection and treatment equipment.

Dr Kashyap has pioneered training programmes for gynaecologists working in State run Sadar Hospitals of Jharkhand on cervical screening through VIA screening methodology and colposcopy guided CRYO treatment by trained oncogynaecologist from USA, Delhi and Kolkata.

Notably, Dr Kashyap’s three-pronged strategy against cervical cancer is bearing fruits in many ways. Today, thousands of women have been cured of cervical pre cancer and genital infections, free of cost. Governor and MLAs of different parts of Jharkhand helped her in equipping 13 out of 23 Government Sadar Hospitals with cervical cancer pre cancer treatment machines and also mass awareness on genital hygiene and symptoms of cervical pre cancer and anemia is being made.

Dr Kashyap has been conferred with Nari Shakti Puraskar 2017 by President of India, for women empowerment in 2018. She has been awarded thrice by National Indian Medical Association, women empowerment award 20 Achiever Award 2014 by New Delhi, for contribution to society particularly women, children and medical profession.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-ophthalmologist-wages-war-against-blindness--cervical-cancer.html

75,08-3-20,City roads will now be mechanically swept,"Hi-tech mechanical sweeping machines made their debut on the City roads on Saturday morning. Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) launched the mechanical sweeping project to clean the roads of the State capital on March 7.

The project was inaugurated by Mayor Asha Lakra at the Bapu Vatika in Morabadi, Ranchi. Deputy Mayor Sanjeev Vijaywargiya, Deputy Municipal Commissioner (DMC) Shankar Yadav and ward councilors were present on the occasion.

“RMC constantly strives to keep the city clean and in this regard mechanical sweeping has been launched in Ranchi. These machines are used in various other cities across the country to clean the roads. Women are generally seen sweeping the roads which makes them very prone to accidents. Keeping the various factors in mind, the project has been started to keep the major roads of the City clean,” said the Mayor.

In order to avoid any inconvenience to the residents, the machines will be seen plying the City roads from 10 pm to 6 am. Sweeping on the routes identified by RMC will either be done on a daily basis, alternate days, twice in a week or once a week depending on the population of the locality. RMC has marked 10 routes for daily sweeping, 9 for alternate days and 22 for twice a week sweeping.

“For managing municipal solid waste, various programmes are in the pipeline and mechanical sweeping is one such initiative which will be functional from March 7. As per the rules of solid waste management, RMC is also planning programmes related to primary collection, secondary collection and processing the waste at Jhiri dumping site which will be implemented in the coming months,” said the DMC.

The mechanical sweeping machines which arrived in Ranchi on February 13 have been taken into operation after completing all the administrative and technical formalities. A three- member inspection team from IIT Patna has inspected the quality and standard of these machines.

To clean the roads mechanically, a total of three machines will be used by the civic body- two with a capacity of 5 CBM and one with 3 CBM. RMC has signed an agreement with Delhi based company- Lions Services Limited to operate these vehicles which has already been operating in other cities like Mohali and Chandigarh.

As per the agreement, the vehicles will cover a distance of 125 Kms on a daily basis as a part of the sweeping process. For monitoring the smooth operations of this initiative, the civic body has also set up a control room in its premises.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/city-roads-will-now-be-mechanically-swept.html

77,08-3-20,IOCL to start selling BS-6 fuel from April 1,"Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) on Saturday said it is all set to supply low emission BS-6 from April 1 and that there may be a marginal or slight increase in retail prices.

The largest oil supplier of the Country has spent over Rs 17,000 crore to upgrade its refineries to produce the low-Sulphur diesel and petrol, informed the Company’s Executive Director Bihar State Office (BSO) Vibhash Kumar told reporters in Ranchi while talking to media.

Without disclosing the quantum of price increase, Kumar said, “There is chances that the retail prices of fuels may register marginal increase from April 1 when the whole Country will be run on new fuels, which will have Sulphur content of only 10 parts per million (ppm) as against the 50 ppm earlier.”

However, Kumar, asserted that the price hike will not be a burden on consumers. “We are not looking at this investment from a purely return on investment basis, but this is a national mandate and we have done it,” he added.

Kumar said that the State-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) have also invested thousands of crores of rupees to upgrade their refineries.

Addressing the gathering of media persons Kumar said that the Company has been supplying BS-6 from February 26-27 and that it would sell only the new fuels from March 1. IOC switched to BS-VI fuel production a fortnight ago and all its depots and containers are ready now, he added.

However, Kumar said some remote locations, where the sell is very low, will take some more time to supply the fuel. But the company is planning to drain out the entire BS-IV stock and replenish the new fuels at such locations, he added.

Speaking on the occasion the Executive Director said that, all those countries that moved to low emission fuels are charging higher prices; and from April 1, the prices will also be benchmarked against Euro VI prices as against the present practice of cost-plus model.

The Ministry of Petroleum, Government of India has decided that it will supply BS-6 fuels across the Country from April 1 of this year to comply with the resolution of Perish Summit to decrease CO2 emission. The Ministry decided to switch to BS-6 from BS-4 skipping BS-5 entirely in a little over three

years as BS-4 was introduced in 1917.

Speaking on the occasion IOC BSO Chief Manager Corporate Communication, Vina Kumari said that there is two storage terminal in Jharkhand one at Jassidih and another at Khunti. “The Company also installed two bottling plants in the State, one at Bokaro and another at Jamshedpur,” she added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/iocl-to-start-selling-bs-6-fuel-from-april-1.html

80,08-3-20,The story of missing girls,"‘Missing’ was started to create awareness about girls who are kidnapped from Indian villages and sold as sex slaves around the world, writes Leena Kejriwal in a first person account of how she put together a powerful public art project

It was in 2013, that I met Karishma at a small tailoring shop in Sunderbans. Her head was lowered as she was busy sewing a colourful kurta. She looked up to see me, and I caught her sweet smile and sharp features. We spoke for a while and the conversation slowly drifted to how she was trafficked. But at the very mention of it, her whole being suddenly froze — and within seconds — her eyes widened and were blank.

I realised that we had reminded her of a memory that haunted her. She did not want to speak about it. It took some time but I managed to calm her down. When she finally spoke, the one thing that she said struck me hard. She said she did not know that she could have been “trafficked”. She did not know that young girls and women from her region were victims of sex trafficking. They had no idea that a dark world like this even existed.

This memory has stayed, grown, and over the years, made me realise the importance of building awareness in the public, especially among young girls and women, on this rapidly growing flesh trade.

So though I was then creating books/ putting up exhibitions and multi-layered installations in gallery spaces, I realised I wanted to engage the public out and not within these walls. In 2013, I took my first step towards creating a strong public artwork that would transcend language barriers that would talk to the public.

From this, emerged the Missing silhouette.

In 2014, I launched ‘Missing’ Public Art Project to engage the public on the issue of sex trafficking. It was the culmination of years of my work on the issue. I had worked in Kalighat, Bow Bazaar, Khidderpore. Spent a lot of time with Ruchira Gupta, founder of Apne Aap Women Worldwide, Sraboni Sarkar of South Kolkata Hamari Muskaan and Urmi Basu of Newlight in Kalighat, and understanding the angst which those working in these spaces faced because of the constant and growing demand which led more girls to be sold.

The Missing had a good launch at the India Art Fair with JSW and immediately caught the eye of many international and national media through its installations, the larger than life black silhouettes of young girls placed against the urban skyline. Constructed from iron sheets, forged and painted pitch black, they seem like sharp, black holes cut out into the sky. Holes, into which, millions of girls disappear from the face of the earth. It was meant to invoke in eye of the beholder the sense that something is gone. The public art works serve as both a symbol of what is and is not, what we must address, a reminder, not an illusion, a fact, not a suggestion, something permanent rather than ephemeral.

As my intention was public engagement, we soon started building an online community through social media outreach. This gave us an insight into what people think, how they think and what points or platforms can be a catalyst or a game changer in shaking the status quo in our society with regards to trafficking for sexual exploitation. We wanted to build an army that would join us in our cry to end demand for vulnerable young girls and women.

At this point, we started exploring the idea of crowd funding and making the Missing Project for the people, by the people. The crowd funding not only helped us prepare for the amazing opportunity to bring out our first set of public installations in future but also gave us a golden opportunity to create the Missing game for a cause. This was a one of its kind gaming app, engaging the public by putting them into the shoes of a trafficker.

We also thought of a means of powerful public engagement at the ground level. Something that was very visual with a high impact and having a high recall. That is how the stencil project came to life through the Missing silhouette.

The Missing silhouette is seen again and again across the country in the street stencil project. We have realised the power of the stencil art. It has become the most visual and powerful part of the Missing campaign.

This got us to another milestone in the journey. We formed Missing Link Trust in October 2015 and we continue to work tirelessly and passionately to reach out to more and more stakeholder through all our campaigns.

We want Missing to be synonymous with awareness against trafficking for sex. We want our engagement to provide knowledge as arsenal to children, women, young girls and boys so that they can avoid being victims of trafficking. Parallely, through all our engagement, we want to have an undercurrent running across our programmes that mind shapes the young males in India into de-objectifying the female human body and creating more sensitive and empathic youth towards gender differences. Further, it would also create a more compassionate view for the victims of sex trafficking. One of the last key things is also to create an environment among young girls where they de-clutter their concept of femininity, which is currently overridden by the masculine gaze.

We realised that trafficking is primarily demand driven. In simple terms, demand equals supply and an unaware public, directly and indirectly, contributes to this demand. If we created awareness, we knew that we could hit the pain point and work towards ending demand.

The Missing primarily works in anti-trafficking awareness. We strongly believe that awareness equals prevention and use different awareness tools and methodologies in our mission.

The Missing Public art works are larger than life black silhouettes of young girls placed against the urban skyline. Constructed from iron sheets, forged and painted pitch black, they seem like sharp, black holes cut out of the sky. Holes, into which millions of girls disappear, from the face of this earth. These expanded forms act as memorials to these young girls who have disappeared, vanished into thin air. It is hoped that these emblematic silhouettes generate curiosity, recognition and finally a sense of deep loss, recovering them from the abyss of the sky. A recovery that inspires millions of others to act on behalf of the fate of those who have disappeared and are alluded by justice. So far, the installations have been showcased with the India Art Fair and Pune Biennale.

The Stencil Campaign uses the Missing Girl silhouette. It is a powerful means for engaging the public and providing ownership in the campaign to end demand. Each person who creates a stencil becomes a spokesperson for ‘Missing’. We want the public to have ownership in the drive to end demand and make it an inclusive and open campaign. It was critical to create this shift from an exclusive to an inclusive structure. The silhouette of a young girl symbolises a black hole into which millions of girls disappear from the face of the earth.

She is a constant reminder and a remembrance of the millions of girls who have been lost. She is a girl who has lost the power of making choices. This stencil artwork also serves as a method of sharing the very important information that the number 1098 is the pan-India Childline helpline for children in distress or missing.

Though this very language of using public art and a global stencil campaign is very innovative the ‘Missing’ Game For A Cause has been the most unique to our campaign. It’s a role-playing game designed to put players in the decision-making seat to make choices and assess risks to experience what a ‘missing girl’ goes through when she is trafficked into the cruel world of prostitution; a world into which millions of girls are lost every year. The gameplay and storyline invoke discomfort in the player through the intensive and claustrophobic experience of being in the victim’s shoes. ‘Missing’ Game For A Cause is a first of its kind game built on the Unity platform to be translated in Indian vernacular languages.

This puts Missing as an innovator and changemaker in leveraging technology in a unique way to bring about long-lasting social change. The game, much like Missing’s other initiatives, focuses on raising awareness and thus prevention of sex trafficking. The game is easily playable for anyone with access to a smartphone. This gives us the ability to reach and create awareness amongst a vast and varied, urban and rural audience through the vernacular localisation of the game. The game has the potential reach of millions in all parts of the world, and most importantly in remote areas where other traditional means of awareness generation cannot penetrate

with ease.

The storyline for ‘Missing’ Game For A Cause was formed on the basis of interviews with trafficking victims and survivors. Soon after its launch, the Missing game won the NASSCOM Indie game of the Year award and received 820,000 organic downloads across 70+ countries on the Google Play Store and App Store. The initial localisation in Bengali organically reached the number1 spot in the Bangladesh Google Play Store within a week of its launch.

The Missing project has been running under the aegis of the Missing Link Trust for nearly four years now and every day is an exciting day! There are Games Apps, school programmes, skill training and digital literacy programs being rolled out. All our actions are driven with the focus to stop trafficking and ending demand and help save the next girl from getting trafficked. We hope it will make a difference.

81,08-3-20,"Krishna, the yogeshvara","Name : Krishna Yogeshvara: The Dice of Kutil Dharma

Author : Sanjay Dixit

Publisher : Bloomsbury, Rs 499

Sanjay Dixit's book two in Krishna trilogy presents the essence of Bhagavad Gita as the culmination of the wisdom attained by Krishna in his quest to champion the cause of dharma, writes Saiswaroopa Iyer

To the delightful cosmos of stories woven around Lord Krishna, comes a new addition. Krishna Yogeshvara by Sanjay Dixit is the second installment of his trilogy, preceded by Krishna Gopeswara, published in Mid 2018 by Bloomsbury. The second installment keeps with the great expectations that the first book set in the minds of readers.

With an intriguing start, embedded with delicious detail, the Krishna Yogeshvara starts off with the elopement of Princess Rukmini of Vidarbha and Krishna. The self-sufficient, poised and curious nature of Rukmini draws the reader right into the story and then we are treated to the story of Krishna with Rukmini being the listener.

Sanjay Dixit’s style of story telling needs to be dwelt upon here to sufficiently admire his balancing of the prevalent western story telling craft in the market along with the key aspects of Indic storytelling, which includes a seeker or listener possessing the adhikara according to Shastras. Commercial aspects like pace, flow, twists are well backed by Indic aspects of philosophy, detail and research.

The combination makes the book conducive to discerning as well as what we could call as ‘airport’ style readers. Even while maintaining the taut pace, the author does take care to present philosophical delights like Uddhava Gita, a wonderful debate between Bhakti and Atmatattva. As a writer in the same genre and a sworn lover of Krishna, I found this delicate intertwining of storytelling techniques as a source of valuable learning.

Yogeshvara spans the story of Krishna from his arrival at Mathura through the intrigues he steers the Yadavas through, including the vengeful wrath of Jarasandha, rise of the Pandavas and ends before the start of the famed Kurukshetra war. In other words, it traces the part of Krishna’s trajectory where he stops being a reactionary hero against Kamsa’s tyranny to a proactive leader and lord who seeks to wrest control away from adharmic forces and establish a rule of Dharma.

My piece of advice to readers is to dwell upon the insightful dialogue that makes us pause and contemplate. Because Krishna Yogeshvara (For that matter, the whole of this series) is not just a story, but if viewed with sufficient bent of enquiry, one can see the civilisational narrative that Dixit tries to weave mirroring the crossroads where India of our times is. Readers of the first installment would remember the genesis of Kutil Muni, who represents an over zealous monotheistic philosophy. Krishna Yogesvara has an addition to the philosophical clash in the form of this character called, Jatil Muni. One can say Jatil Muni is a sophisticated and an affable version of the treacherous philosophy propagated by the Kutil Muni from Krishna Gopeshvara. As Krishna trajectory goes steeply upwards, keeping with the narrative of the Mahabharata, so does the rot in the land of Bharata, propelled by tyrannical forces like Jarasandha and underhanded initiatives of Jatil Muni.

In Dixit’s narratives, care has been taken to craft the characters who fall for the fanatical monotheistic cults. The rise and fall of Kamsa owing to Kutil Muni’s influence is a great example. We encounter another such victim in Yogeshvara — Duryodhana. While Krishna, nimble and wise as he is in the field of Raj Niti and Raj Dharma, works to eradicate the tyrant that is Jarasandha and fills in the power vacuum with Yudhishtira, the young Dharma abiding son of Pandu, who is also loved by the people, Jatil Muni’s tentacles spread deeper than one could perceive, taking the gullible Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra under his influence.

The twists of fate that follow the meteoric rise of the Pandavas resulting in the notorious game of dice and further weakening of the Dharmic foundation of the Kuru family is a well-known story from the Mahabharata. What makes the narrative of Krishna Yogeshvara unique is the careful examination of how mistakes or overlooking of things by even those who are wise, valiant and dharmic costs not only them but even the land they rule and love, dearly.

It is a lesson that the people of India need to learn, revise and review at every opportunity they get to read the scriptures like Mahabharata or their wonderful retellings like the book being discussed. We need to learn it so that Kamsas and Duryodhanas stop rising from amongst us in any millennium. That alone would be a worthy tribute of gratitude we can offer in return for the immortal Bhagavad Gita that Krishna gave us through Arjuna.

In Krishna Yogeshvara, the essence of the Gita is presented as the culmination of the wisdom and realisation attained by Krishna in his quest to protect and champion the cause of dharma. Arjuna’s despondence right at the beginning of the great war is the ending event of this book, leaving the reader with a mindful cognizance of the ‘Yoga’ of Yogeshvara that would follow next.

One does expect the writers of this genre to wield their imagination and creative liberty to present a novel perspective. That makes the ‘how’ of the plot execution very important to the reader’s experience. Without giving much detail away, I want to say that the game of dice, the disrobement and Krishna’s physical intervention (yes, in person) do make for a breathtaking story telling. I remember reading this part of the story in the middle of night with no signs of sleep coming till I could read the following chapters!

While that was about the main plot, there are also smaller joys that ancient history lovers would love to encounter across the book. The author has managed to wonderfully reconcile the mysterious debate around Rukmini’s Arunachali origins. The geography of ancient India and the significance of each location is enunciated with an elan that would make the reader feel like he is truly journeying through the times of our ancestors.

Each of the characters be it major ones like Uddhava, Balarama, Rukmini or minor streaks like Satyabhama add their own touch of liveliness even as the plot thickens in the background. There is also an exploration of ancient customs, of Shastrartha, Purva Paksha, astronomy and other traditions that adds an enriching dimension to those who are new to the wonders of ancient India.

The finale and the third installment of the series, titled Krishna Parameshvara, I expect would explore the crux of the Bhagavad Gita and the ensuing war, a topic of my personal interest and passion. Something I shall wait for, given the promise made by the first two books. If you are a lover of ancient history, Mahabharata, India or Krishna, this is a must read book.

89,08-3-20,In the steps of the yak,"Name : Into the Heart of the Himalayas

Author : Jono Lineen

Publisher : Speaking Tiger, Rs 499

‘Walking induces clarity; its pace and simplicity engenders contemplation. In the conscious motion of my footsteps was heightened awareness’, recalls jono lineen in his book. Excerpt:

August 30

Kargil sits at the confluence of the Suru and the smaller Wakha rivers. It is a town of 10,000 people and is similar to many of its sister villages across the border in Pakistan with mud-brick, flat-roofed houses, concrete-block government buildings, a noisy bus park and a coating of dust on everything. But Kargil seemed a particularly dirty place. Maybe there was more traffic, and so more diesel exhaust stains on the walls and pools of oil by the side of the road, but there was also bright plastic garbage blowing in the wind and the laundry I saw flapping in the breeze was speckled with soot. Kargil is the last Muslim town before the shift to Buddhism and the town closest to the disputed border. It is a place on the frontier of religious and political divisions. Some residents resent the fact they are controlled by the Indian Army. As one man with a full beard, grimy jeans and the smell of old tobacco about him whispered to me in a tea shop by the bus park, ‘We are occupied by a force of idol worshippers and dark men.’

The place was not inviting, so after that quick cup of tea, during which I felt that half the men in the crowded chai shop were staring at me, I walked southeast down the Wakha Valley. I passed a few small villages along the way and after about twenty kilometres reached the confluence of the Wakha and Phokar rivers where I turned south and soon came to Phokar village, the first Buddhist community on my trek. Families were in the fields harvesting barley and because of the altitude, 3,200 metres, for the first time I saw yaks instead of goats grazing on the leftover stubble. I later learned the animals at Phokar were in fact a cross between yaks and cows called a dzo, bred for their higher milk production and more manageable demeanour.

The pungent smell of dung fires lingered in the air. The village looked prosperous. Every few hundred metres I passed two-storey mud-brick mansions with walls a metre and a half thick and flat roofs piled high with tight sheaves of freshly cut barley. The whitewashed walls were rubbed with diamond- shaped, blood-red markings, which I was to learn were protection from the evil spirits that many Buddhist Ladakhis believe lurk behind every ill-considered action. On the roofs of the houses, above the front doors, conical, one-metre-high terracotta incense burners billowed out peppery, juniper wood smoke; locals believe the particular smell attracts benevolent energies.

The majority of Ladakhis follow a Tibetan style of Buddhism which traces its local history back to the eighth century when the region was caught in the midst of the clash between Chinese and Tibetan expansionism. Control of the region moved back and forth between the two powers but in 842 Nyima-Gon, a Tibetan royal representative, took advantage of the chaos surrounding the separation of the Tibetan empire and annexed Ladakh for himself. This initiated a period of Tibetanization that has continued to this day. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries Ladakh was invaded multiple times by Muslim armies. It was splintered but never completely conceded its independence and in 1470 King Lhachen Bhagan united the state and founded the Namgyal dynasty that still exists. In 1834 the Dogra army from Jammu successfully invaded Ladakh and made it part of Kashmir. During partition in 1947 Ladakh was invaded by the Pakistani Army. Kargil and Zanskar were occupied but eventually, after the Namgyal king signed the Instrument of Accession, which made the area an official part of the new Indian state, the Indian Army repulsed the invaders.

The trail up through the village was lined with stupas, earthen domes built upon square mud-brick pedestals and topped with brick or brass spires. Some were crumbling, while others seemed freshly painted. The stupas came in all sizes, some smaller than an upended shoebox, others more than seven metres high. Stupas were the earliest Buddhist religious monuments. Initially they were built to house what were thought to be relics of the Buddha. Over time they changed from being reliquaries to being objects of veneration themselves. Stupas came to be propitiated not for what they may have contained, but for what they represented. They have become architectural manifestations of the Buddha.

I tried to imagine the stupa as a devoted Buddhist might: the square base stepping upwards like a mind logically moving through levels of realization towards a state of enlightenment; the spherical core, both expansive and receptive, like the knowledge of the Buddha; and atop the dome a spire, a needle of fierce mind reaching for the highest state of consciousness.

By the roadside and scattered around the stupas were boulders, rocks and pebbles each chiselled with the ubiquitous Tibetan mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum: Om — the jewel inside the lotus flower — Hum. I found myself repeating it in time with my steps. Om — stride, Mani — stride, Padme — stride, Hum — stride. I had learned the mantra years before in Kathmandu and it had become a peaceful mumble that, to this day, sneaks up on me unconsciously.

I played with the words, quickened my pace and the mantra sped up. I slowed and the prayer lingered, working its way like a bass tone into my chest, sound and movement working together.

I bent down and picked up one of the mani stones. It was flattened and water-worn, a perfect river skimmer, smooth on one side, rippled with chisel work on the other. I slipped it into my trousers and felt it rubbing through the thin cotton of my pocket against my thigh.

I pitched my tent that night a few kilometres beyond Phokar in the lee of a wall constructed of thousands upon thousands of hand-carved mani stones, a work of devotion generations in the making. As I lay in my sleeping bag, a breeze blew through the stones, generating an undulating moan. The prayers serenaded me to sleep.

90,08-3-20,Probe into Af war crimes: Will truth prevail?,"International Criminal Court judges has authorised a far-reaching investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed by the Afghan Government forces, the Taliban, American troops and US foreign intelligence operatives.

The appellate ruling marked the first time the courts prosecutor has been cleared to investigate US forces, and set the global tribunal on a collision course with the Trump Administration. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda pledged to carry out an independent and impartial investigation and called for full support and cooperation from all parties.

“The many victims of atrocious crimes committed in the context of the conflict in Afghanistan deserve to finally have justice,” Bensouda said. “Today they are one step closer to that coveted outcome.”

Washington, which has long rejected the court’s jurisdiction and refuses to cooperate with it, condemned the decision while human rights groups and lawyers for victims applauded it.

“This is a truly breathtaking action by an unaccountable political institution masquerading as a legal body,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a State Department briefing. “It is all the more reckless for this ruling to come just days after the United States signed a historic peace deal on Afghanistan, which is the best chance for peace in a generation.”

His comments reflect long-held distrust of the ICC by the US Government. In 2018, then-National Security Adviser John Bolton said the court — established in 2002 to prosecute atrocities throughout the world — “unacceptably threatens American sovereignty and U.S. national security interests.”

A five-judge appellate panel upheld an appeal by prosecutors against a pretrial chamber’s rejection in April last year of Bensouda’s request to open a probe in Afghanistan.

While acknowledging that widespread crimes have been committed in Afghanistan, pretrial judges had said an investigation wouldn’t be in the interests of justice because the expected lack of cooperation meant convictions would ultimately be unlikely.

That decision drew fierce criticism from rights organisations who said it neglected the desire of victims to see justice in Afghanistan and effectively rewarded states that refused to cooperate with the Hague-based court.

Even though an investigation has now been authorised, the prospect of suspects appearing in court in The Hague any time soon remains dim. Like the United States, Afghanistan also opposed the investigation.

Rights groups, however, welcomed the decision.

“The ICC Appeals Chamber’s decision to green light an investigation of brutal crimes in Afghanistan despite extreme pressure on the court’s independence reaffirms the court’s essential role for victims when all other doors to justice are closed,” said Param-Preet Singh, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch. She added that the decision “also sends a much-needed signal to current and would-be perpetrators of atrocities that justice may one day catch up to them.”

At a hearing in December, prosecutors argued that pretrial judges at the global court overstepped their powers by blocking the investigation. The appeals judges agreed.

“The Appeals Chamber considers it appropriate to amend the appealed decision to the effect that the prosecutor is authorised to commence an investigation,” Presiding Judge Piotr Hofmanski said.

After a preliminary probe in Afghanistan that lasted more than a decade, Bensouda asked judges in November 2017 to authorise a far-reaching investigation.

She said there is information that members of the US military and intelligence agencies “committed acts of torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, rape and sexual violence against conflict-related detainees in Afghanistan and other locations, principally in the 2003-2004 period.”

Katherine Gallagher, Senior Staff Attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, who represents a group of victims of US detention, said the decision “breathed new life into the mantra that ‘no one is above the law’ and restored some hope that justice can be available — and applied — to all.” Gallagher represented two men still being held in US detention at Guantanamo Bay, Sharqawi Al-Hajj and Guled Duran, and the wife of a third man who has died.

Bensouda alleges that the Taliban and other insurgent groups have killed more than 17,000 Afghan civilians since 2009, including some 7,000 targeted killings, and that Afghan security forces are suspected of torturing prisoners at government detention centers.

At a December hearing, the Afghanistan Government objected to the probe and said it had set up a special unit to investigate war crimes. The ICC is a court of last resort that only takes on cases if domestic jurisdictions are unable or unwilling to prosecute.

Pompeo said the US “will take all necessary measures to protect out citizens from this renegade, unlawful, so-called court. This is yet another reminder of what happens when multilateral bodies lack oversight and responsible leadership and become instead a vehicle for political vendettas.”

Jamil Dakwar, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Human Rights Program, criticised Pompeos reaction.

“No one except the world’s most brutal regimes win when the United States tries to impugn and sabotage international institutions established to hold human rights abusers accountable,” Dakwar said.

The Coalition for the International Criminal Court, a nongovernmental advocacy organisation, called on the tribunal’'s 123 member countries states to support it.

“ICC States Parties must stand firm in solidarity with the court and urge the US Government not to attack individuals who work to bring alleged war criminals to justice,” Legal Officer Ricardo Izquierdo said.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/probe-into-af-war-crimes--will-truth-prevail-.html
91,08-3-20,Ban on 2 Malayalam channels revoked,"Amid widespread criticism and ""concern"" expressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Centre on Saturday said it supported press freedom and revoked the 48-hour ban it had imposed on two Malayalam news channels on Friday. However, it turns out, Information & Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar was seemingly not aware of his Ministry's move to ban the channels. A ""shocked"" News Broadcasters Association (NBA) demanded an inquiry as to ""how a decision like this was taken without the knowledge of the Minister"".

The Congress and Left parties called the clampdown ""stifling of media freedom"" and the Press Club, Kerala Union of Working Jouranlists (KUWJ) and Kerala Newspaper Employees Federation (KNEF) took out a protest march in Thiruvananthapuram.

The channels were suspended for 48 hours beginning 7:30 PM on Friday over their coverage of the communal violence in Delhi. The official orders said that the channels covered events of February 25 in a manner that ""highlighted the attack on places of worship"", ""sided towards a particular community"" and questioned the RSS and accused the Delhi Police of inaction.

The ban on Asianet News was lifted at 1.30 am and that on Media One News at 9.30 am on Saturday.

Javadekar told reporters in Pune that Prime Minister Modi expressed concern over the entire issue. ""We immediately found out what exactly happened and therefore, we immediately restored the channels,"" Javadekar said, indicating the action was taken by his Ministry without his knowledge.

""I will definitely go into the details and take essential steps if there is any wrongdoing. But let me also tell you that everybody should accept that there has to be responsible freedom,"" he further said.

""Our basic thought process is that the freedom of press is absolutely essential in the democratic set up and that is the commitment of Modi government,"" he said even as he referred to the Emergency when the freedom of press was suppressed.

The Minister said the views of the NBA have been sought after he spoke with its president Rajat Sharma, who condemned the ban. The NBA statement also confirmed Javadekar was not in the loop on the ban. Sharma stated that the NBA is shocked to learn that a decision like this was taken without the knowledge of the Minister for Information & Broadcasting. ""NBA demands that the Minister should institute an inquiry as to how the order prohibiting the news channels from broadcasting was issued without his approval. NBA would like the inquiry report to be shared with it,"" he said.

Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted: ""Glad wisdom has dawned on the government in the face of the widespread outcry against this outrageous decision. Trust the bureaucrats responsible for this undemocratic behaviour will be pulled up and taught the limits of their arbitrary authority. Our freedoms must be fought for every day.""

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan termed the ban a ""dangerous trend"" and said it was an indication of the coming dangers. ""There is a threat that if anybody criticises RSS and Sangh Parivar, they will be taught a lesson,"" he said in a statement.

Asianet News Editor M G Radhakrishnan said the management of the channel contacted the I&B Ministry after the ban was imposed and spoke to relevant people explaining its position on the matter. But Media One Editor-in-chief C L Thomas said his channel had not reached out to the government and the Ministry had ""suo motu"" revoked the ban.

""They (management) seemed to have succeeded in their attempt. Since it was night there was no time for making any formal application. They spoke with all the people concerned in the ministry and convinced them. That is what the minister has also come out saying today,"" Radhakrishnan said asserting, ""There was no apology made from our side. The reporting was all factual"".

Asianet News is indirectly owned by BJP Rajya Sabha member Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

Thomas said: ""We were proceeding for legal action. Today we got the information that the ban has been revoked, so we did not go ahead with the legal proceedings. We did not contact anyone in the Ministry, the Government suo motu lifted the ban.""

Meanwhile, in Thiruvananthapuram media personnel holding placards and raising slogans participated in the march against the centre's decision. Similar protests were held in various parts of Kerala.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ban-on-2-malayalam-channels-revoked.html

At the same time, Jaishankar made it clear that India was also getting to know ""who our friends really are"". He said it is a kind of geo-political assessment as there was a time when India was very defensive, its capabilities were less, threats were more and risks were higher.

""We adopted a policy of managing the world but kind of staying away. We can't do that anymore. We are the 5th largest economy of the world and will be the third largest. We have to engage everybody and find solutions,"" he said.

""In a sense you would have geopolitical constituency out there in the world. There will be people who understand the changes of India, who agree with it, there are people who may not agree with it. I would not mix the two. I would not mix apples and oranges. I think these are two different processes at work. But, I will come out ahead at the end of it,"" the minister said.

On the issue of CAA, he said: ""We have tried to reduce the number of stateless people through this legislation. That should be appreciated. We have done it in a way that we do not create a bigger problem for ourselves.""

""Everybody when they look at citizenship has a context and has a criterion. Show me a country in the world which says everybody in the world is welcome. Nobody does that. Look at America. Look at the Europeans. I can give you example of every European country. There is some social criterion,"" he noted.

On the UNHRC director not agreeing with India on the Kashmir issue, Jaishankar said, ""UNHRC director has been wrong before. How carefully they (UNHRC) skirt around the cross-border terrorism problem, as if it has nothing to do with country next door. Please understand where they are coming from; look at UNHRC's record how they handled the issue earlier.""

On opposition to the CAA and whether India has not been able to convince the world enough, he said, ""There are sections of the world outside of the media.""

He noted that he has engaged with governments and cited the example when in Brussels, he had 27 foreign ministers in a room to whom he was talking.

""The point we make on CAA is that it cannot be anybody's case that a Govt or Parliament doesn't have the right to set the terms of naturalisation or citizenship. Every government does that, every parliament does that.

""What we have tried to do is we have a large number of stateless people. We have tried to reduce the large number of stateless people we have in this country through this legislation. That should be

appreciated. We have done it in a way that we do not create a bigger problem for ourselves. Everybody when they look at citizenship have a context and has a criterion,"" he said.

Jaishankar also said moving out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was in the interest of India's business.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-country-says-everybody-is-welcome--foreign-minister-hits-out-at-caa-critics.html
93,08-3-20,"Do not believe in rumours, follow doctors’ advice: PM on coronavirus","Amidst tightening of safety measures and surfacing of more confirmed coronavirus cases which now stand at 34, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday asked people to stay away from rumours relating to the disease and emphasised on the need to follow the advice of doctors in this regard, avoid handshakes and greet others with 'namaste' to bring the Indian tradition back to practice.

As cases affected by coronavirus are rising in India with two more persons from Ladakh who had travelled from Iran and one identified in Tamil Nadu who returned from Oman testing positive, the Prime Minister advised people to not to go by impromptu suggestions on food intake to prevent the disease and asked them to rather go by doctors' advise to ward off the disease.

Interacting with the owners of some Rs Jan Aushadhi KendrasRs and beneficiaries of the Rs Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi PariyojanaRs (PMBJP) through video conference on the occasion of Rs Jan Aushadhi DiwasRs the Prime Minister sought people not to trust rumours.

""In such times, rumours circulate very rapidly. Some say don't eat this, don't do that. Some people will bring in new things such as eat this to keep coronavirus away. It is my request to all my fellow countrymen, kindly keep away from these kinds of rumours,"" he said.

""Whatever you do, kindly do it on the advice of your doctor. Let's not become doctors ourselves,"" the Prime Minister added.

The entire world is taking up the habit of 'namaste', Modi said. If due to some reason we have discontinued this habit, it is the right time to once again take this up instead of handshakes, Modi said.

""Jan Aushadhi Diwas is not only a day about celebrating a scheme, but it is a day to join with crores of Indians, lakhs of families who have got major relief through this scheme,"" Modi said.

It is also a day to reach out to other people to popularise this scheme so that poorest of the poor of the country can also avail the benefits, he added.

Talking about the impact of the PMBJP initiative, he said every month, over one crore families are getting benefits of cheap medicines from these Jan Aushadhi Kendras.

Over 6,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras across the country have helped people save between Rs 2,000-2,500 crore, he added.

There are 6,200 Jan Aushadhi Kendras in about 644 districts in the country. Total sales of these stores in the financial year 2019-20 have crossed Rs 390 crore.

The cost of medicines at Jan Aushadhi stores is 50 to 90 per cent cheaper than their average market price. Giving an example, he said a medicine used for the treatment of cancer is priced at around Rs 6,500 in the market, but the same is available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras for Rs 850.

The government has decided to give awards in this field to recognise the efforts of the people who are running these stores. These awards will start a new, healthy competition in the field of Jan Aushadhi, he added.

""I believe the biggest beneficiary of this competition will be poor and middle class,"" Modi said even as he appealed state governments to ask doctors to prescribe only generic medicines.

As part of celebrating the Jan Aushadhi Diwas, Modi spoke with various people running the Jan Aushadhi Kendras at Guwahati, Dehradun, Pune, Varanasi, Pulwama and Coimbatore, among others.

The store owners as well as other beneficiaries shared their experiences with the Prime Minister.

Speaking about Jammu & Kashmir, Modi said in the past one-and-a-half years development is taking place at a rapid pace in the Union territory. During this period, over 3.5 lakh people have come on board the Ayushman scheme and three lakh elderly people, women and differently-abled have been provided with the government pension scheme in J&K.

Modi also became emotional when one Deepa Shah from Dehradun, who suffered from a paralytic attack in 2011, broke down while narrating her ordeal and the high cost of treatment earlier, as she thanked him for the scheme.

Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilisers D V Sadananda Gowda participated in the programme at Jan Aushadhi Kendra in Varanasi, while Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviya participated from a Jan Aushadhi Kendra in Pulwama.

The Pariyojna was launched by the Prime Minister with the objective of making high-quality medicines available to all at affordable prices, especially to the poor and underprivileged, through the Jan Aushadhi outlets.

A day before Prime Minister while speaking at an event organized by a media house had felt that coronavirus has come up as a big challenge in front of the world and all have to tackle the situation together. The virus that has originated from China , has , so far killed more than 3,200 people globally.

""The board deferred the judgment today (Saturday),"" a senior police official said, adding that the verdict is likely to be delivered on the next date to be fixed by the court.

The JJB on Thursday pronounced that the minors were part of a mob that had allegedly lynched 55-year-old Khan, a dairy farmer, in 2017. This is the first conviction in the sensational case. In August last year, six men who were accused of lynching Khan were acquitted by a lower court of Alwar.

The six accused — Vipin Yadav, Ravindra Kumar, Kaluram, Dayanand, Yogesh Kumar and Bheem Rathi — were given the benefit of doubt and were acquitted. The State Government filed an appeal against the trial court order in the Rajasthan high court in October.

96,08-3-20,Desi arms production to make India $5 tn economy by 2024: Rajnath,"The Government has set a target of $26 billion turnover in aerospace and military manufacturing in next five years, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday, noting that indigenous defence production was key to achieving the country's aim to be a $5 trillion economy by 2024.

He said adequate thrust is being given on enhancing defence exports though the primary aim of indigenous defence production is to cater to the needs of the armed forces.

In an address at the ET Global Business Summit, urged the private sector to increase its participation in defence manufacturing to realise the government's vision of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024.

Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi set an ambitious target of making India's economy a $5 trillion one by 2024. The current size of the Indian economy is around $2.8 trillion.

In his address, Singh said the manufacturing sector has the potential to reach $1 trillion by 2025 and that the government is striving to achieve the goal by implementing key flagship programmes like 'Make in India'. ""In our envisaged Defence Production Policy, we have clearly spelt out our goal to achieve a turnover of $26 billion in aerospace and defence goods and services by 2025. This will have huge implications for India's endeavours to promote R&D, innovation and its efforts to secure a place in global supply chains,"" he said.

Asking the defence industry to make best use of the opportunities, he said a slew of structural reforms has been initiated by the government to ensure synergy among key stakeholders.

Singh said the government accorded approval to more than 200 proposals worth Rs 4 lakh crore in defence manufacturing in the last five years.

He also said the government's aim is to double the size of aeronautics industry from Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore by 2024.

He said a number of major platforms are envisaged in defence aerospace sector including India's 90-seater civil aircraft, developing civil helicopter industry of $5 billion in public-private-partnership model.

He listed out several reform measures including simplification of the industrial licensing process, hike in FDI cap, making defence export less stringent, streamlining the defence offset policy and opening the government-owned trial and testing facilities for the private sector.

Singh said defence public sector undertakings have been encouraged to increase their export portfolio to 25 per cent of their turnover and the government is willing to extend Lines of Credit and grants to friendly foreign countries over the next five years.

""The Government aims to achieve exports of defence goods and services to the tune of $5 billion in next five years. All possible support would be extended to the private sector so that they can contribute significantly to enable us to achieve the said target,"" he added.

Highlighting the decision to enhance foreign equity cap from earlier 26 per cent to 49 per cent under the automatic route and up to 100 per cent under the government approval route, he said the measures have begun to show results.

""Till December 2019, the defence and aerospace sector has received inflows of over Rs 3,155 crore. Of this, Rs 1,834 crore have received since 2014. I am sure that the volume of investment will increase manifold when some of the major programmes, which are in the pipeline, move into the execution phase,"" he added.

Singh assured the industry that the government is open to new ideas and committed to fully harness the energies, entrepreneurship spirit and enterprise of private sector in the defence sector.

He expressed confidence that the industry will contribute even more to the government's efforts towards indigenisation of defence production.

Singh stressed that the intention of the government is not just limited to bringing reforms but to act as an incubator, catalyst and facilitator for promoting investment and achieving self-reliance in defence manufacturing.

""We understand that Defence R and D in private sector will take time to establish itself. To give a boost to this process, we have opened opportunities through DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) with a zero fee for Transfer of Technology (ToT), free access to over 450 patents, access to test facilities and an upfront funding of up to Rs 10 crore,"" he said.

Singh said more than 900 licensing agreements for ToT have been signed with private industries.

He also mentioned about the opportunities being provided by the government for the manufacture of mega defence platforms including fighter aircraft, helicopters, tanks and submarines under the strategic partnership model.

The defence minister told the gathering that the government has prepared a roadmap for application of artificial intelligence in national security set up, adding there is a plan to develop at least 25 defence specific artificial intelligence products by 2024.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/desi-arms-production-to-make-india--5-tn-economy-by-2024--rajnath.html
97,08-3-20,Ill-framed mind can derail you,"I was sitting in a party with six others around a table. One of them raked up the subject of recent mayhem in Delhi and got into blame game. The person sitting by his side came out with his counter narrative, taking the blame game exercise to other extreme. One person, who patiently heard their never ending arguments and counter arguments for long, burst out: “If highly educated people like you stay stuck to your perceptions, and not come to terms with reason, how do you expect lesser educated people, who are stuck to their ardent beliefs, to be ever in accord with each other?” Conscientious people need to ponder upon this serious issue and provide lead.

Well, perception drives a being, which is primarily defined by thought-imprints in mind, carried over from the past. What you pick up in your own right or those fed into the mind by majority view of the social or religious group you belong to, influence your thought process. It appears that the whole society is caught up in a sense of insecurity — with majority group afraid of losing its control in the future and the minority groups fearing their existence. With that comes a sense of identity crisis, which plays the devil in the societal framework. A lot of misguided people are found emerging on the scene, who go overboard posing as self-acclaimed defenders of their group identity, often leading to communal and ethnic clashes. The result is there for all to see — across the globe, with all the mindless killings happening every now and then.

It is high time society elders make aware the people with the truths of life, so simply put forth in Indian philosophy. See, how beautifully Kathopanishada, also referred to in Bhagwad Gita, come out with two fundamental truths of life. First, the living order is a unified organism, where no individual existence has a reality independent of the entirety. Second, it emphasises upon the interdependence of all diverse existence. Metaphorically, the whole world is presented as an inverse Asvata (Banyan) tree with the roots above and with its trunk, branches, twigs, with all the leaves turned downward. The root above implies that the whole life structure owes its genesis to the infinite cosmos, beyond ordinary human perception. The difference in the size and shape of the branches, twigs, and the leaves symbolise existent diversity in the world. The whole tree works as an integrated mechanism. If, we ever any part of it, say a twig, is forcefully separated from the main tree-body, it becomes lifeless, a dead matter. Even if we look at the life mechanism on planet earth, similar truth will come out. Water flowing down the stream extends life all across, with the trees and the vegetable world, which in turn, manages the weather cycle to sustain water resources. Even otherwise, no individual can secure even one’s bare survival by oneself. But all, complementing and supplementing each other’s efforts, put together makes out a self-sufficient world. If this truth of life dawns upon a being, it will bring in a strong humane sense, which alone can ensure peace and harmony in the society.

More important, however, is to do away with the preconditioning of each human mind for a reasoned approach in life. A case in point are astrological pointers of a being pointing to his mental inconsistencies. Although armed with great potential, but his glaring fault-lines limits them substantially. Mind signifying Moon conjunct Jupiter grants him with a fertile brain, who would apparently follow a value system. The two, however, being opposite mischievous Neptune, would mean that no matter how high moral ground he may take, fact remains that he would be stuck to his delusionary fanciful perceptions, distanced from ground realities. He would not be open to look beyond for a reality check. He may not acknowledge truth on its first appearance and would rather passionately pursue his beliefs on hope against hope, till pushed to the wall. Moon placed in Aries, favourably aligned to Uranus, which read together with six planets in fiery signs make him highly ambitious. He dreams big, impulsively jumps into action without applying proper forethought, often ending up in a crash. All the more because, intelligence signifying Mercury is ill-disposed off to both Jupiter and Moon, which accounts for his insensible reasoning and judgment. When he fails in his personal endeavour, he vents out his frustration in loud talk on societal predicament. Consequently, he though in his early sixties, has not been able to establish himself.

98,08-3-20,Karo na panic,"Coronavirus aka COVID-19 is raging world over and has recently breached the Indian borders too. For a high population density nation like India, this could be catastrophic. However, experts feel this is no time to panic but just to be cautious. SHALINI SAKSENA and MUSBA HASHMI find out how the upcoming warm weather, staying out of big gatherings and simple hygiene can help save the day

Delhi-NCR is in panic mode. More so, since it has been raining for the past two days and Delhiites have been taken up by the idea that the virus doesn’t live if the temepratures rise abover 26-27 degree C. However, the truth of the matter is that there is no need for panic or rush to hoard masks which is a must only for caregivers and the patients themselves. Then there are the numbers that point to the fact that there is no need of fear. Unlike SARS that had a mortality rate of 10 per cent, for COVID-19 is just 3.4 per cent.

It started when a pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China on December 31, 2019. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020. Since then 96,251 cases have been detected golbally; 3,303 people have died and 53,708 have recovered. The coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected 86 countries and territories around the world and one international conveyance — the Diamond Princess cruise ship harbored in Yokohama, Japan). This cruise ship has 16 Indians onboard.

Back in India, there was a calm till the first three cases came to light in Kerala. Fortunately, they recovered. But it made the country vulnerable and rightly so. The first case of COVID-19 in the Capital came to light on March 2, 2020. The fallout? Two schools in Noida were shut even as new cases continue to come to fore, the latest being a Gurugram PayTM employee who had recently been to Italy, one of the worst hit countries.

While some are comparing this virus to SARS, doctors have a slew of measures and advice for the people. According to Dr Om Shrivastav, director, Infectious Diseases, Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai tells you the situation is being evaluated in the country. “There have been some people who have tested positive. There are a few simple things that people need to follow to prevent the spread of this disease. First, be adequately hydrated. Drink at least three to four litres of water every day. Make sure that you wash your hands at regular intervals with soap and water. Those who can’t wash hands, they can simply rub an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wipe. If a person is tested positive, it is important that the tissues and handkerchiefs are disposed of responsibly in order to prevent the spread,” Shrivastav explains.

Dr Hirenappa Udnur, Consultant Pulmonologist, Columbia Asia Hospital, Hebbal, Bengaluru, tells you that one of the simplest ways of disposing of the tissues used by infected patients and anybody displaying signs of infection is by throwing it in a closed bag and into a closed dustbin.

Shrivastav tells you that sanitisers have a very important role to play; to keep the hands as clean as possible. He also tells you that any surface that one touches is a potential source of givng one an infection hence the need for frequent handwashing. This is because the COVID-19 settles on surfaces for a limited period of time. “In needing to ensure that one is cleaning the hands every time you touch that may or may not be infected; this can include any surface from a tray to a table to a door knob and even elevator buttons — all of these are likely to carrying the virus and hence clean the hands,” Shrivastav says.

He strickly advises people against wearing a mask unless one is a caregiver to a sick patient. There is, he says, no scientific evidence that mask is going to act as a protection against the virus.

Dr Ron Diskin, Department of Structural Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel tells you that the new SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in China in December is rapidly spreading and efforts for stopping or slowing down the spread of the virus could have a substantial impact on our everyday life routines.

“Like in any other infectious disease, isolating individuals who contracted the virus is the most effective way of achieving control. However, some people that contract SARS-CoV-2 will develop only a very mild sickness or will not become sick at all, an attribute that substantially complicates the effort of controlling the spread of the virus, as these individuals may go unnoticed and unintentionally transmit the virus to others. Hence, high personal hygiene is needed to reduce the risk of contracting the virus — specifically, frequent washing of the hands and avoiding touching our mouth, nose, eyes, and ears,” Diskin opines.

But he tells you that while such changes in personal behaviour could make a real impact on the spread of the virus, it will not be feasible to maintain them for a long period of time adequately. A more fundamental solution is required, and the most desired one would be an effective vaccine. “Many vaccine platforms and technologies were previously developed and could now be adapted to combat SARS-CoV-2. One promising approach is to use a replicating unrelated viral vector that will be engineered to display a protein of SARS-CoV-2 on its surface. This approach was utilised to design Ervebo, the first anti-Ebola vaccine that was recently approved for use. Besides vaccines, there is a great effort to test off-the-shelf drugs like Remdesivir (Gilead Science) for treating patients, as well as to develop more targeted therapeutics. While such therapeutics will almost certainly become available, it will take an unknown amount of time until they could be usedin our fight against this virus,” he says.

To give a sigh of relief to the people, Ministry of Ayush has come up with a drug, Arsenic Album 30, to tackle the virus. However, there is no proven evidence to show the drug’s effectiveness.

Dr Kushal Banerjee from Dr Kalyan Banerjee’s Clinic, says that since this is a novel virus, there is an absence of strong evidence demonstrating specific efficacy of any drug in any system of medicine for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. “Homeopathic prescriptions work on the analysis of symptoms and Arsenic Album 30 was arrived at by the study of the symptoms that this virus produces. At our practice we are advising the use of Eupatorium Perfoliatum 30 and Lycopodium 30, once a day for two weeks. It is important to remember that in the absence of any evidence supporting the treatment or prevention of COVID-19, these medicines are being advised based on their efficacy in the management of other similar viral infections. It is also important to emphasise that consumption of any homeopathic medicines should not be taken as assured protection from infection. It is also irresponsible for anyone to suggest this. As in any other infection, we must remember that all other protective measures must be taken. Any behaviour that may increase risk of infection must be strictly discouraged under all circumstances,” he tells you.

What I’m doing for the COVID-19 pandemic: Molecular virologist

Dear Colleagues, as some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s).

I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (eg: SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.

The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April.

Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves:

NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump

Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches, elevator buttons. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.

Open doors with your closed fist or hip, do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.

Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.

Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60 per cent alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from any activity that involves locations where other people have been. Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. and in your car.

cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!

What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread

Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.

Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! But all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon.

This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells. The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.

Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!).

The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.

Stock up with zinc lozenges. These have been proven to be effective in blocking corona virus from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel any ""cold-like"" symptoms. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.

I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, But I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defence against it.

Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. But there will be no drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.

99,08-3-20,Talktime : ‘Actors can’t lie on my show’,"Komal Nahta | This trade analyst is back with another season of Starry Nights with GEN Y that goes on air from March 15 on Zee Cafe. Shalini Saksena speaks with Nahta about what is new this time round, the celeb list and much more

What is the theme for the show this time?

We are keeping in mind the younger generation of stars; their lifestyle and their attitude towards life. Therefore we have sections like mid gear and cosco and chill and grin. We have tried to get into their mind and present to the world the human being behind the star.

Who are some of the celebrities?

Some of the stars that the show will host this time round are Vicky Kaushal, Kiara Advani, Siddhant Chaturvedi, Rakulpreet Singh, Sara Ali Khan, Ishaan Khattar and Ananya Pandey to name a few.

You have been in the industry for so long. How has Bollywood changed?

In the last 10-15 years, the industry has become more professional and the stars are much more aware than those of the good old days. The new set of actors are not only aware about Bollywood but other things as well. Also, due to social media the whole approach to their work and life, it has been a 360 degree change. The stars of the good old days were stars in two ways — they were unreachable and unattainable. Today, the stars bare it all out on Instagram and Twitter. They sometimes give a sneak peek into not just their professional but their personal lives as well; they post photos. They want people to look at them as more than just stars, of course, they are stars. They are very clued in about things. Then there is the whole journey towards ‘it’. Be the producer, the director, the actor or the crew, they are all working this ‘it’ film a super hit film.

Can you share a few interesting parts from Starry Night’s Gen Y?

In one of the segments where we grill the stars. Before the programme begins we tell them that they can’t lie, they have to tell the truth and the whole truth. This segment is interesting since it is a difficult section. The actors can’t lie or hide the truth. This is because we have done our homework, a thorough research. If they are not honest, they will be exposed. Another interesting segment is where the star is called in with his mentor or a director who has been instrumental in furthering his career. We give the two a situation where one has to intact that and the other person has to create roadblocks and vice- versa. This segment makes the show so different from all the brothers that are out there. The look and feel is also very GEN Y.

Why GEN Y??

In the first season we had the 40s stars; then we had the rolling stars with their companion— sibling or mother or father or even a friend. The young generation of stars had never been on our show. We decided to devote an entire season on them because these are the stars who have only been in the scene for the last four or five years.

It has been found that films critics don’t always match up with audience views. What does it say about the changing tastes of the viewers?

While it is correct that film critics don’t always match up with public opinion but my views are that of a trade analyst. I am not a film critic. A film critic reviews a movie keeping in view his personal space. My reviews are never personalised. My views are based on account of what the world and what the public needs to know about the film. So my work is just the opposite of what a film critic does. I tell the public why a film will be like or not like. And why the public will or not watch the film. Why they will adore it or not. I talk about the dynamics of the movie. The problem is that today, almost everyone is either a film critic or a trade analyst. Therefore, the audience is apolitically for choice.

Which according to you has been the best film of 2019-2020? What is special about it?

It has to be War and Kabir Singh. War was good because it was made on international scale — the look and feel was fantastic. Then there was Hrithik Roshan. He looked like a million star. His work was out of the world. Tiger Shroff was so good in the movie. Kabir Singh was good because it was such a powerful film. One didn’t know whether to love the hero or not. He had so many flaws but still one just fell in love with him.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------actors-can---t-lie-on-my-show----2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------actors-can---t-lie-on-my-show---.html
100,08-3-20,The wow factor,"This Women’s Day, gift yourself the freedom and the opportunity to travel solo, SUMITRA SENAPATY tells MUSBA HASHMI

All of us have thought about going on a solo trip. While most of the men out there may have turned it into a reality but the women must have been a little apprehensive about whether it is a good option, keeping in mind how unsafe it is for a single woman to travel alone even if all the arrangements for stay and local travel have been made in advance. Meet Sumitra Senpaty, Founder of Women on Wanderlust (WOW) Club who is giving wings to women to fly solo.

Being a freelance journalist, Senapaty had to travel to all over the world. It was then, when she thought of doing something for the women who are too fond of travelling but eventually have to give up the idea because of several reasons.

“I had a background in travelling since my father was in a transferable Government job and I had travel to various places. So I became a freelance writer and started contributing my articles to several magazines and newspapers. While I was travelling overseas, I went on a solo driving trip to New Zealand. Tourism New Zealand had invited me and I got to know that no women journalists from India were ready to go for the trip. But I noticed during the trip that women from different countries were there and they were enjoying themselves. That’s when I realised that there was a gag for solo women travellers in the country. This made me think why not come up with a travel club for women; not an agency. Because women of our country usually don’t put faith in travel agencies. That’s how I came up with WOW in June, 2005,” she tells you.

Senapaty wanted to make WOW a social platform and a community where women from different walks of life can come together, have fun, make friends and experience a short get away from their daily lives. “I knew that women are extremely busy. So I wanted to provide a single stop solution to them. That’s how we started booking their tickets, getting the insurance done and applying for visas — basically everything under one window. Something like this was not there back in 2005, it was an opportunity that I took up,” she says.

The first place that she thought about going to was Ladakh, which still continues to be the most popular destination among women travellers.

Even the name of the club was finalised because it gave a feel of a travel community. “I was looking for some acronyms. I thought of several names and then Women On Wanderlust struck my mind. It had a nice acronym too. It made sense too,” she tells you. The first batch of travellers that she took for a trip to Ladakh was of around 12 people which has now grown to 20 people, which means a houseful.

“I don’t have any plans of increasing the capacity because then it would become a travel agency which is not the idea. I want to keep it very personalised and maintain the community feeling. Moreover, the responsibility and the travelling expenditure will also increase,” she says.

Not that Senapaty was always sure of coming up with the club, there were several apprehensions too. “I waited for a year before introducing it. I kept telling my family that this is what I have in mind but I am not sure whether it will turn out to be successful. My family got so bored and tired of my talks that they told me to give it a try,” she tells you.

If the idea doesn’t sit well with you and if you are worried about the safety and security of your loved ones, then worry not. Solo doesn’t mean solo here. “When I say solo, I mean that a woman can go without her family and friends but with the security and safety of the group. It makes a difference because if one goes with her family then there is a lot of responsibility. You have to manage everything and take care of everyone’s needs but that’s not the case here. Women can enjoy to the fullest without having to worry about several things. This is how it is solo but not exactly solo at the same time,” she explains.

Women from Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru take such trips more frequently. The price of these trips vary from Rs 25,000 to Rs 4,00,000 depending upon the destination and duration of the trip. The longest trip was to Antartica — 15 nights.

“We have earned so many loyal customers who are now travelling with us for the last 15 years,” she says.

There are so many takeaways from such trips. From beautiful memories to lifelong friends everything is worth the time and money. But these trips gave Senapaty a lesson for life. “The most important lesson that I learnt is that travelling makes you feel alive. All the stress and negativity is gone in a jiffy. All you take back home is optimistic thoughts and a cheerful mood,” she tells you.

Since it’s International Women's Day today, Senapaty has a message for all the ladies. “When you travel, the freedom is huge and empowering. Travelling solo gives you an opportunity for adventure, fun, some 'me time’ and a chance to make new friends. Travel is a change making phenomenon — that changes the way women are. A change for the better of course! So keep all your worries aside and give it a try,” she says",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-wow-factor-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/the-wow-factor.html
101,08-3-20,"‘I’m an actor, platforms don’t matter’","Sarika Singh, who was seen in films like Ok Jaanu and Jagga Jasoos, will now be seen in Kaamyaab. She speaks with SHALINI SAKSENA about her journey thus far

Did you always want to be an actor?

Yes. I have been in the industry for 12-13 years now. It all began with theatre. I have been part of so many plays and I love everything about it. I knew when I entered this industry that I didn’t have the conventional face for the heroine. But theatre gave me the opportunity to be myself. It taught me everything about the industry as well. It got me wherre I am today, to just being given parts in films for two-three scenes where I get scripts where I am asked to play a bai, or a mother, I now get roles where I play the lead.

What is your role in Kaamyaab and what is the movie about?

The film is about a man who has played a side character for decades. It talks about his struggles and aspirations. I play this man’s daughter and see how her father goes through the ups and downs that the industry, for which he has given his life, puts him through. It is such a beautiful subject and story. The industry is not just about the leads. There are so many others who are in a movie but people don’t see that aspect. Through Kaamyaab, the director (Hardik Mehta) wants the audience to see the story of others as well.

Do you think that the public will like this subject?

Why not? The subject is new and relatable. With the changing tastes of the people and the fact that they are looking for content that is relatable means that this film will have many takers who will appreciate a story that talks about people who are not shown to look glamourous on the 70 mm screen.

Would you agree that this change has opened more avenues for actors life yourself?

Definitely. Like I mentioned before, I now get scripts where I am offered more than two-three scenes. I now being offered pivitol roles. It feels good when people come with offers where I am have more than 10-12 shots in the film.

You have done theatre, films and web series. How are they different?

To be honest, as an actor there is not difference. In my mind, I am an actor first. The platform doesn’t matter. The only difference is that in theatre, you get to know the audiences’ reaction is instant. You get to know whether they like what you are doing or not or whether they want to throw tomatoes at you, not that it has ever happended. The kind of films and web series that are being made today, gives actors like myself to a platform where we can show our talent.

Do you think that the story of Kaamyaab had to be told?

It was long overdue. It is time that the audience also saw what the character actors lives are about. How they go about their lives, what they want from life and what their ambitions are. People only one side side of the coin. There is another side to it which needs just as much attention as the actors who play lead.

Should we stop distincting between commercial and parallel cinema?

Cinema is cinema. As actors we do what is asked of us. When I did Ok Jaanu, Jagga Jasoos and Bombay Velvet, we didn’t do it wirh the intentions that it was a commerical movie. That happended later.

What are upcoming projects?

Besides theatre, there are a few films that are slated to release later in the year. Then there are some projects that are in the pipeline that at present, I can’t talk about.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---i---m-an-actor--platforms-don---t-matter----2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---i---m-an-actor--platforms-don---t-matter---.html
102,08-3-20,‘Being a woman is a privilege’,"MALAIKA ARORA KHAN tells MUSBA HASHMI her definition of a strong woman and a message that she would like to give

What are your sentiments towards celebrating Women’s Day?

As this year’s theme for International Women’s Day is #EachforEqual, I believe that we need equality for women too. A woman can do anything if she is determined and has set her mind to something. Being a woman is a privilege and this day should truly be about celebrating the invincible spirit of women.

What is your definition of a strong woman?

Every woman who uplifts another women is strong. Being strong is a state of mind and reflects in how you handle situations in life. Encountering challenges and doing so with a positive and never-give-up attitude is the sign of a strong woman. Someone who is independent, self-sufficient, self-reliant and the one who brings a smile on everyone’s face is a strong woman.

Women who have inspired you...

There are quite a few women who have inspired me, but my mother is my biggest inspiration. She has inspired me to grow and helped me achieve everything that I am today. I thank my stars that I’m the daughter of a lady who has given me such a great life and has taught me so much in life.

A message that you would like to give?

Stay strong ladies! Embrace your womanhood and make great choices which will help you grow.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---being-a-woman-is-a-privilege----2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---being-a-woman-is-a-privilege---.html
103,08-3-20,Pawfect Holi,"The festival is all fun and frolic for everyone except for our furry friends. Devanshi Shah shares tips on how to make it pet-friendly

The festival of colours Holi (Rang Panchami) is just around the corner. Sure, everybody loves to play with colours and coloured water along with water-filled balloons, but does your pet want the same?

These colours have chemicals and toxic substances that are injurious to pets. Human can wash themselves and the colour will run out. But with pets, the stains remain for a little longer. The pets go through psychological and physical trauma if exposed to these colours. If ingested while cleaning themselves, it can be hazardous to their gastrointestinal tract and if inhaled it may cause respiratory disorders.

Here are a few steps you can undertake and prevent discomfort caused to pets:

Posters: To create awareness about keeping pets away from colours, one can stick posters in their areas. These can state reasons to keep their pets away from colours or coloured water by making known the harm it causes to the furry ones.

Keep your four legged indoors: To prevent any risk, it is safest to keep the furry one indoors for a few hours. It will rule out all the chances of harm.

Keep sweets away: Although, the traditional puranpoli may look tempting, but it is essential to keep it away from your pets. Chocolates and raisins are equally harmful and need to be kept away from the furry ones.

The colour should be kept away from your dog’s reach: Store the colours in a place where your dog won't be able to reach them. It may cause nasal irritation on inhaling.

Don’t let kids near pets: Kids enjoy this festival more than anyone else. Make sure to keep the kids informed and away from your pets to avoid any mishaps during your celebration.

However, if you’re upset you cannot play holi with your furry one, you can enjoy your evening in a floatable pool and jump in and splash around! Soak in a cold baby pool under the sun without the colours being thrown around. The evening can call for a longer walk with your pet or extra time in to a fun play area.

Let us show some affection and spread some love this Holi season!

104,08-3-20,J&K Govt shuts down schools till March 31 to fight coronavirus,"Acting swiftly to contain the spread of coronavirus infection cases immediately after preliminary test reports of two suspected coronavirus patients reported 'probability of testing positive', the Jammu&Kashmir Government on Saturday ordered all primary schools across six districts to shut down till March 31 with immediate effect.

The government also announced an immediate suspension of all biometric attendance in the Union territory till March 31 while advising people not to panic as adequate measures were put in place to meet the challenge. The government also appealed to the public to fully cooperate wherever quarantine was advised.

The first alarm was raised early Saturday morning by Rohit Kansal, Principal Secretary,Planning,Development and Monitoring and official spokesman of the Jammu and Kashmir government.

Posting series of tweets he reported, ""The test reports of the two suspected coronavirus patients were received, which spoke of them being high viral-load cases. There is a high probability of their testing positive for the infection"". He added that both the patients were kept in isolation at the Government Medical College, Jammu.

""They are stable and all protocols are being followed,"" the spokesperson said.

Samples of these two patients with a travel history to coronavirus-hit Italy and South Korea were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. According to official sources, their final reports were still awaited.

Addressing a press conference late evening, Kansal said that the class work up to the primary level has been suspended in six districts of Jammu and Kashmir as a precautionary measure.

“Class work up to primary level has been suspended till March 31, 2020, in Jammu, Samba in Jammu division and Budgam, Baramulla, Srinagar and Bandipora in Kashmir Division. This is just a precautionary move and there is no need to panic”, Kansal told the media persons.

He said the government is monitoring and reviewing the situation closely, even as elaborate arrangements have been made to handle the situation.

“All entrants to Jammu and Kashmir via road are also being monitored at Lakhanpur and Lower Munda respectively. Help desks at Railway stations, Jammu and Katra are also operational,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/j-k-govt-shuts-down-schools-till-march-31-to-fight-coronavirus.html
105,08-3-20,China exports plunge on coronavirus epidemic,"China’s exports plummeted in the first two months of this year on the back of a coronavirus epidemic that forced businesses to suspend operations, disrupting the world’s supply chains.

Exports fell 17.2 per cent, the biggest drop since February 2019 during the trade war with the United States, and imports dropped 4 per cent, according to official data released Saturday. A Bloomberg poll of economists had expected exports to drop less, by 16.2 per cent, but had forseen a much starker drop on imports of 16.1 per cent.

Consumers stayed home during the Lunar New Year break at the end of January and businesses saw a much slower return to work, as the country struggled to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus, which has killed more than 3,000 people in China alone.

China’s trade surplus with the US — a key point of contention in the trade dispute between the two countries — sharply narrowed 40 percent in the first two months, from $42 billion last year to $25.4 billion.

Chinese authorities said last month that January and February’s data would be combined. This is in line with how some other indicators are released, to smooth over distortions from the holiday break.

In an early sign of the economic impact to come, China’s manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level on record in February, with non-manufacturing activity plummeting as well.

Capital Economics’ Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a report Friday that the decision to combine the data in January and February means the “published growth rate won’t fully reflect the extent of the recent weakness.” This is because the disruption was mostly concentrated in February.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/china-exports-plunge-on-coronavirus-epidemic.html

107,08-3-20,Govt invites bids for sale of BPCL,"In the country’s biggest ever privatisation drive, the government on Saturday invited bids for sale of its entire 52.98 per cent stake in India’s second biggest oil refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL).

Expressions of interest for the strategic sale of BPCL have been invited by May 2, as per the bid document by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM).

“The Government of India is proposing strategic disinvestment of its entire shareholding in BPCL comprising of 114.91 crore equity shares, which constitutes 52.98% of BPCL’s equity share capital along with transfer of management control to a strategic buyer (except BPCL’s equity shareholding of 61.65% in Numaligarh Refinery Limited),” it said.

NRL stake will be sold to a state-owned oil and gas firm.

The bidding will be a two-stage affair, with qualified bidders in the first expression of interest (EoI) phase being asked to make a financial bid in the second round.

PSUs “are not eligible to participate” in the privatisation, the offer document said.

Any private company having a networth of $10 billion is eligible for bidding and consortium of no more than four firms will be allowed to bid, it said. As per the bidding criteria, the lead member of the consortium must hold 40 per cent stake and others must have a minimum networth of $1 billion.

Changes in consortium are allowed within 45 days but the lead member cannot be changed, it added.

BPCL will give buyers ready access to 14 per cent of India’s oil refining capacity and about one-fourth of the fuel market share in the world’s fastest-growing energy market.

BPCL has a market capitalisation of about Rs 87,388 crore and the government stake at current prices is worth about Rs 46,000 crore. The successful bidder will also have to make an open offer to other shareholders for acquiring another 26 per cent at the same price.

Privatisation of BPCL is essential for meeting the record Rs 2.1 lakh crore target Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has set from disinvestment proceeds in the Budget for 2020-21.

BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai (Maharashtra), Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh) and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15 per cent of India’s total refining capacity of 249.4 million tonnes.

While the Numaligarh refinery will be carved out of BPCL and sold to a PSU, the new buyer of the company will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity.

BPCL also owns 15,177 petrol pumps and 6,011 LPG distributor agencies in the country. Besides, it has 51 LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) bottling plants.

The company distributes 21 per cent of petroleum products consumed in the country by volume as of March this year and has more than a fifth of the 250 aviation fuel stations in the country. The government has appointed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP as its transaction advisor for the strategic disinvestment process.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-invites-bids-for-sale-of-bpcl-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-invites-bids-for-sale-of-bpcl-govt-invites-bids-for-sale-of-bpcl.html

According to depositories data, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) withdrew a net Rs 8,997.46 crore from equities and Rs 4,159.66 crore from the debt segment during March 2-6, taking the total net outflow to Rs 13,157.12 crore.

Prior to this, FPIs were net buyers in the Indian capital markets for six consecutive months since September 2019.

""The spread of coronavirus in the US is a major driving factor and India is witnessing a spillover effect of what is happening in the global markets. There has been a consistent drain of money from Indian equities as well as the debt where FPIs are fleeing the Indian markets amidst fear of an extended slowdown,"" said Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO, Groww.

The US Fed brought in an emergency rate cut of 50 bps, which shows that the US government is expecting a slowdown, he noted.

As per Jain, the current situation in India, seen along with the Yes Bank crisis, is not very encouraging.

""In the next 3-4 weeks, the coronavirus behaviour in the western world will dictate the investment behaviour by FPIs in India,"" Jain said.

Echoing the views, Nirali Shah, senior research analyst at Samco Securities, said ""The sell-off is certainly the effect of uncertainty caused by rippling effect of coronavirus (COVID-19) in major economies.""

Going forward, depending on how the US market reacts to coronavirus and slowdown fears, FPIs will react as the US economy will be the cue for these investors for either bringing in fresh investments or withdrawing from India, Shah added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fpis-turn-net-sellers--pull-out-rs-13-157-cr-in-march-so-far-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fpis-turn-net-sellers--pull-out-rs-13-157-cr-in-march-so-far.html
109,08-3-20,Volkswagen expects SUVs to account for at least 60 pc of sales by 2024,"European auto major Volkswagen expects at least 60 per cent of its sales in India to come from the SUV segment by 2024 amid the market globally moving away from sedans.

Volkswagen, which launched the 7-seater premium sports utility vehicle (SUV) Tiguan Allspace on Friday as part of its India Project 2.0, is planning to roll out three more such vehicles in the next 12-18 months.

The world's largest car maker is trying to revive its fortunes in the domestic automobile space, in which it has a meagre around 1 per cent market share with Skoda-led India 2.0 plan.

""I think we will be (selling) around 60 per cent SUVs going forward. Globally, we have today about 42 per cent of all our cars in SUVs.

""I would assume, in India, it could go even up to 70 per cent by 2024,"" Volkswagen Passenger Cars India Director Steffen Knapp told PTI.

Knapp said this would also depend on what is happening in the market, adding, ""I believe that all around the world, we are going into 70-75 per cent.... So, there will be another category coming, the SUV and CUV (cross utility vehicle), as higher seating position is the future. Because it (market) is moving away from sedans.""

Volkswagen sells hatchback Polo, sedan Vento and Tiguan SUV in the domestic market along with Tiguan Allspace now.

Under the Rs 8,000-crore India 2.0 Project, the car maker is aiming to corner a combined 5 per cent market share of the total domestic passenger vehicle segment by 2025 with India-specific products through a dedicated platform, MQB A0 IN.

""We believe that the SUV is the future body style as also in India for the VW. If you look at Volkswagen strategy all around the world, we are not the first ones. So, we always kind of wait and then we top it, "" he said.

Tiguan Allspace will be followed by T-Roc compact SUV, he said.

""What we found out is if you want to move your brand upwards, which we need to do, you need to be top of the volume. You need to have more SUVs,"" he added.

On the outlook, Knapp said he is expecting the market to come back into ""normal waters"" from July onwards, though in the first two months of the year, the passenger car sales have seen a de-growth of 5 per cent on account of coronavirus and subsequent supply-chain issues with some of the manufacturers.

""We believe that from July onwards, we should come into normal waters again... Now, this situation in China and around the world, obviously, we have to reassess. We have some manufacturers who went down by 55-60 per cent. And, this is basically either they are changing models, or they are having huge issues with the supply chain. So, it is very very difficult,"" Knapp said.

He, however, exuded confidence that the market will rebound, adding that Volkswagen's Rs 8,000-crore investment plan in India remains on track.

""We are sticking to that...All is rolling in the right direction. We are already refurbishing our production line to the MQB platform. So, everything is on track. There's no change in plan because it's fundamental to us. This is the chance for us to move us into the next level,"" he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/volkswagen-expects-suvs-to-account-for-at-least-60-pc-of-sales-by-2024-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/volkswagen-expects-suvs-to-account-for-at-least-60-pc-of-sales-by-2024.html

The RBI further said that concerns about the safety of deposits in banks are based on a flawed analysis.

""Concern has been raised in certain sections of media about safety of deposits of certain banks. This concern is based on analysis which is flawed. Solvency of banks is internationally based on Capital to Risk Weighted Assets (CRAR) and not on market cap,"" the central bank said in a tweet.

""RBI closely monitors all the banks and hereby assures all depositors that there is no such concern of safety of their deposits in any bank,"" its second tweet said.

Earlier, echoing similar sentiments, Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian said Indian banks are well capitalised and there is no reason to worry, adding that it is a wrong method to assess a lender's health based on the ratio of deposit to m-cap (market capitalisation).

""What I want to emphatically state that the m-cap ratio is a totally incorrect metric for assessing the safety of the banks. No banking sector expert or banking regulator uses this measure,"" Subramanian said.

A day after imposing a 30-day moratorium on Yes Bank and capping withdrawal limit at Rs 50,000, the RBI on Friday evening had issued a draft reconstruction scheme for the private sector lender.

111,08-3-20,Digital transaction traffic bounces back on PhonePe following service outage due to Yes Bank crisis,"Digital payments platform PhonePe on Sunday said its transactions and user traffic have bounced back to normal, after being affected for 24 hours due to restrictions on Yes Bank.

Over 25 million customers used the PhonePe app on Saturday showing their trust in the platform, according to a statement by the company.

The digital payments platform has bounced back hard in the past 24 hours. The platform processed over Rs 4,000 crore worth of transactions in 24 hours and saw its largest-ever volume of user traffic in a single day (with over 70 million app sessions), it said.

PhonePe saw a service outage for nearly 24 hours, which started immediately after the RBI placed Yes Bank on moratorium on March 5.

The PhonePe team worked overnight with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and new UPI partner ICICI bank to ensure all its services are up within a day, the company said.

All merchant payment settlements were restored by Friday noon and all consumer wallet, credit and debit card payments were restored by 3 pm.

All UPI services were restored by Friday night, with PhonePe users continuing to use their UPI @ybl handles. This ensured that there was a seamless transition for all of its 20 crore customers, it added.

Sameer Nigam, founder and CEO of PhonePe, said, ""Friday was an extraordinarily difficult situation with little precedence. We are grateful to RBI, NPCI, Yes Bank and ICICI for working collectively to ensure that millions of our customers and merchants were not inconvenienced a minute longer than necessary.""

The outage on the PhonePe platform also led to playful banter between the company and its bigger rival Paytm.

""Inviting you to @PaytmBank #UPI platform. It already has huge adoption and can seamlessly scale manifold to handle your business. Let's get you back up, fast!,"" Paytm Payments Bank tweeted on Friday.

However, PhonePe shot back to saying Paytm Payments Bank platform is not seamlessly scalable otherwise the company would have themselves approached it.

""Dear @PaytmBank Inviting you to consider that if your #UPI platform was so 'seamlessly scalable', we'd have called you ourselves. No point getting back up faster, if we have to desert our long term partners when they're down. Form is temporary, class is permanent,"" PhonePe reverted through a tweet.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/digital-transaction-traffic-bounces-back-on-phonepe-following-service-outage-due-to-yes-bank-crisis-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/digital-transaction-traffic-bounces-back-on-phonepe-following-service-outage-due-to-yes-bank-crisis.html
112,08-3-20,"After MLA ‘poaching’ row, war of letters in MP","Following the row over the BJP's alleged attempt to topple the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, the two parties on Saturday indulged in a Rs letter war'.

Chief Minister Kamal Nath, in an open letter, prayed that Lord Hanuman may give ""dignity and character"" to the BJP.

State BJP president V D Sharma, in turn, also wrote a letter, saying political instability had made Nath nervous, for which his close lieutenants were responsible.

In an open letter to the people of the state, Nath said the BJP leaders should not show their hunger for power in such a way that people lose their trust in democracy.

Accusing BJP leaders of tarnishing the state's glorious history and rich heritage, Nath said, ""State BJP leaders have not only tried to destabilise the government, but they have directly attacked the development of the state.""

Referring to his government's welfare works and the action against mafia in various fields, he asked, ""Are these people (those involved in Rs poaching' of Congress MLAs) inspired by the mafia whom I want to root out?

""I am confident that all my MLAs are standing firmly with the government and committed to the development of the state,"" he said.

Sharma, in his letter, alleged that sand and liquor mafia were dominating the Congress government.

He also asked Nath to clarify his alleged role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi, and accused him of misusing the government machinery to harass political opponents.

""You (Nath) are raising a question about the character of your own party MLAs who have already denied any poaching attempt (by the BJP).

""The BJP will continue to oppose the state government's ""anti-people polices"", he said.

""Before leveling charges of greed of power at us, you (Nath) should explain what kind of tricks you adopted to run a minority government,"" the BJP leader further said.

Earlier this week the Congress had claimed that the BJP had ""abducted"" 14 MLAs to bring down the government in Madhya Pradesh, an allegation which the opposition party denied.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/after-mla----poaching----row--war-of-letters-in-mp.html

“DGGI booked a case on March 6, 2020 against Aastha Apparels Pvt Ltd & others. Aforesaid companies have fraudulently claimed IGST refunds on export of goods to the tune of more than Rs 61 crore,” the Finance Ministry said in a release.

The intelligence directorate said the Aastha Apparels Pvt Ltd and others availed input tax credit (ITC) fraudulently on the basis of invoices received from non-existent or non-functional firms or from companies which have indulged in circular trading.

DGGI said two directors of the exporting companies have been arrested on March 7, 2020 under Section 69(1) of CGST Act,

2017 for offences under provisions of Sections 132(1)(b) and 132(1)(c) of the CGST Act 2017.

“The said firms/companies also did not have commensurate purchases backwards. It has been further revealed that the supplier companies to these exporter companies are controlled and managed by few persons only and they are also engaged in claiming of suspect IGST refunds,” said the release.

These companies have created a complex web of circular trading among themselves without commensurate payments or actual supplies of goods to pass on ineligible ITC to the exporters, it added.

Role of suppliers and other persons associated with these Exporters is under investigation.

119,08-3-20,One more victory: Biden wins most Super Tuesday delegates,"Former Vice-President Joe Biden has put an exclamation point on his Super Tuesday victories by winning the most delegates on the presidential primary calendar’s biggest night.

The Associated Press has allocated more than 92 per cent of the 1,344 delegates that were up for grabs on Tuesday, and Biden has such a commanding lead that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders cannot catch up as the remaining votes from that day’s 14 state primaries are counted.

Biden built his delegate lead on Tuesday by racking up huge victories in Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia, while scoring a narrow win in Texas. In all, Biden won 10 states and Sanders won four.

“Look, not long ago the press and the pundits declared this campaign dead, but this week we saw tremendous support across the nation,” Biden told supporters by phone Friday evening. “We changed the whole narrative.”

Sanders won California and three other States — Colorado, Utah and his home state of Vermont. Although Sanders won the biggest State, California, he didn’t rack up the commanding lead required to surpass Biden’s haul.

Biden has won at least 610 delegates from Tuesday’s contests, while Sanders has won at least 513, according to the AP delegate count. There are 102 delegates still to be allocated.

Most of the delegates still not allocated are in California, with the next biggest chunks in Colorado and Utah. Despite Sanders winning all three States, he has already been awarded the largest share of delegates in those States.

Many of the delegates are being withheld because it is unclear whether former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg will finish above the 15 per cent threshold in California, which would score him a significant number of statewide delegates.

Regardless of whether Bloomberg reaches the threshold, Sanders can’t catch Biden because many of the remaining delegates would then go to Biden. Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race on Wednesday.

Overall, Biden has 664 delegates to Sanders’ 573. Sanders started the week with a six-delegate lead. Biden’s performance was all the more remarkable considering his slow start in the first three contests. Less than a month ago, Biden didn’t win a single delegate in New Hampshire.

The contest could now become a drawn-out two-man battle for delegates to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in July. It takes a majority of pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses — 1,991 — to win the nomination on the first ballot. With only two viable candidates left in the race, the prospect of a contested convention is remote.

The race now enters a key stretch as voters in 10 states cast ballots over the next two weeks. Sanders scrapped an appearance in Mississippi to campaign in Michigan — the largest prize on Tuesday, when six states representing 352 delegates vote.

Sanders’ move was an acknowledgement that he stands little chance of blunting Biden’s edge with black voters in the South and must focus on fighting back in the Midwest.

Four states vote on March 17, including delegate-rich Illinois, Ohio and Florida, where Sanders could struggle because of the state’s older electorate and his recent praise of Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

When Sanders ran against Hillary Clinton in 2016, Clinton won in Florida, Illinois and Ohio — the three states with the most delegates at stake in the mid-March primaries. In Florida, the biggest prize of the next two weeks, Clinton nearly doubled Sanders’ vote.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/one-more-victory--biden-wins-most-super-tuesday-delegates.html

122,08-3-20,CBI brings back accused in Rs 10 cr bank fraud case from Muscat,"Succeeding in yet another deportation from foreign shores, the CBI on Saturday brought Sunny Kalra, an accused in a Rs 10 crore bank loan fraud case, to the country from Muscat in Oman. His deportation was on the basis of an Interpol Red Corner Notice issued on the request of the agency in 2016, officials said.

The CBI recently got gangster Ravi Pujari deported from Senegal. Pujari is accused in scores of cases of extortion and drug trafficking.

It is alleged that Kalra, the director of White Tiger Steels Private Limited, took a loan of Rs 10 crore from the Punjab National Bank (PNB), but did not repay it.

He clandestinely removed the hypothecated goods, making it impossible for the state-run bank to recover the outstanding loan amount, the officials said.

The case against Kalra, his wife and others was taken over by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on December 16, 2015, they added.

""Both (Kalra and his wife) were absconding since the registration of the FIR,"" a CBI spokesperson said.

The agency had filed a chargesheet more than a year after taking over the case on December 22, 2016 against Kalra, his wife and three PNB officials — then chief manager, manager and AGM of the bank.

The Interpol had issued a Red Corner Notice against Kalra on May 31, 2016 on the request of the CBI, which led to his location being traced to Muscat, where he was apprehended by local enforcement agencies, the officials said.

""With Interpol's help, the CBI was in regular contact with the NCB, Muscat for the deportation of Kalra,"" an official said.

He added that Kalra was deported as a result of an effective coordination between the NCB Muscat, the Indian Embassy at Oman and the NCB, India (CBI).

""The accused will be produced before a competent court in New Delhi,"" the CBI spokesperson said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/cbi-brings-back-accused-in-rs-10-cr-bank-fraud-case-from-muscat.html

The book (Social Science Democratic Politics-II) concludes with an Addendum on the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 under chapter eight of Unit IV.

The centre had on August 5 last year revoked provisions of Article 370 which guaranteed special status to Jammu & Kashmir and bifurcated the erstwhile State into two Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh. The Centre's announcement proceeded strict curbs across Jammu & Kashmir to maintain law and order. The restrictions were, however, eased out in a phased manner to a large extent as the time passed.

The examination for class 10 is underway in summer zone Jammu where the new session starts in April.

124,08-3-20,"Mary, Amit start with win","Six-time world champion M C Mary Kom (51kg) and the redoubtable Amit Panghal (52kg) stood just one win away from securing Olympic berths after the two boxers advanced to the quarterfinals with contrasting victories of the Asian Qualifiers here on Saturday.

Top seed Panghal notched a hard-earned 3-2 triumph over Mongolia’s Enkhmanadakh Kharkhuu, while the second-seeded Mary Kom produced a typically clinical performance to dismantle New Zealand’s Commonwealth Games bronze-winner Tasmyn Benny for a 5-0 triumph.

Up next for Mary Kom is Filipino Irish Magno, who clobbered Hong Kong’s Winnie Au Yin Yin to force a win in just the second round of her last-16 bout.

The 23-year-old Panghal, who became India's first silver-medallist at the world championships last year, came out unscathed after an intense fast-paced slugfest in which fortunes swung quite wildly and will next face a familiar foe in Philippine’s Carlo Paalam.

Panghal beat him in the semifinals of the 2018 Asian Games and the quarterfinals of the 2019 world championships.

The reigning Asian Games and Asian champion had to dig deep to edge past an aggressive and energetic Kharhuu. Panghal was expectedly quick on his feet, displayed a terrific counter-attacking game and his left hand proved to be especially effective in the first two rounds.

However, the Mongolian sustained the pressure in the final three minutes in which Panghal seemed a bit off-colour. But, he managed just enough to pull through and fetch a divided verdict, avenging his loss to the Mongolian in the World Military Games last year.

“My plan was to be aggressive from the beginning and I think that proved to be a good plan. I am happy with my performance,” Panghal said after the bout.

Mary Kom, on the other hand, made it look quite easy as she outmanoeuvred the Kiwi boxer with her sharp reflexes and a superior counter-attacking game. The 37-year-old veteran’s command over the proceedings was quite impressive.

In another intense pre-quarterfinal bout, Commonwealth Games Silver-medallist Gaurav Solanki (57kg) was beaten 1-4 by top-seeded Uzbek Mirazizbek Mirzakhalilov.

Mirzakhalilov, the reigning world champion besides being a gold-winner at the Asian Games and the Asian Championships, dominated the opening round, was bested by the Indian in the second before roaring back to claim the final round honours and with it, the bout.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mary--amit-start-with-win.html

Sehwag (74 not out; 11x4) played all the shots in the book, including the traditional late cut, while Tendulkar (36;7x4) executed drives, upper cuts and stepped out to spinners, something he did with majestic grace all through his illustrious career.

Tendulkar hammered Suleiman Benn for three successive fours amid the familiar ‘Sachin-Sachin’ chants from the Mumbai crowd.

And as was the case earlier, the legend’s dismissal brought about ‘pin drop' silence in the stadium.

After Mohammed Kaif (14) and Manpreet Gony (0) fell, Sehwag, in the company of Yuvraj Singh (10 not out), chased the 151-run target as the hosts won by 7 wickets.

Earlier, India Legends restricted WI Legends to 150/8 with pacers Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel and spinner Pragyan Ojha grabbing two wickets.

126,08-3-20,Atletico draw with Sevilla,"Atletico Madrid will hope for a tighter contest against Liverpool in the Champions League after playing out a frantic 2-2 draw against Sevilla on Saturday.

Joao Felix looked as sharp at the Wanda Metropolitano as he has done all season and completed a four-minute comeback for Atletico after Alvaro Morata’s penalty cancelled out Luuk de Jong's opener for Sevilla.

But Lucas Ocampos levelled with another penalty at the end of a pulsating first half, again with the help of VAR after a foul by Kieran Trippier, whose involvement at Anfield on Wednesday could be in doubt.

Trippier took treatment after a heavy challenge from Nemanja Gudelj in the second half and while he finished the game, the full-back appeared restricted in his movement.

The draw will be more gratefully received by Sevilla, who sit third in La Liga and two points ahead of Atletico, who are fifth after missing an opportunity to close the gap.

Yet while the top four is by no means a guarantee for Diego Simeone’s side, the Champions League has assumed even greater importance with La Liga's title race firmly out of reach.

127,08-3-20,Trump names Meadows his new chief of staff,"In the midst of one of the most daunting crises of his administration, President Donald Trump on Friday announced he had made a major staff overhaul, replacing his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney with Republican Rep. Mark Meadows.

While much of the country was focused on the spreading coronavirus, Trump announced the surprise reshuffle by Friday night tweet, saying Mulvaney would become the US Special envoy for Northern Ireland.

“I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” he wrote, thanking Mulvaney — who never shook his “acting” title — “for having served the Administration so well.”

The long-rumoured move comes as Trump has been pulling together a team of loyalists and allies ahead of what is expected to be a bitter reelection fight. But the timing — as his administration was already facing criticism over its handling of the outbreak — threatened to exacerbate concerns about the Government’s ability to protect the nation from a virus that has now infected more than 100,000 people worldwide.

Mulvaney had been leading the administration’s interagency response to the virus until Trump designated Vice President Mike Pence to lead the whole-of-government effort more than a week ago.

It was just one of a long series of downgrades for Mulvaney, whose relationship with Trump began to sour not long after he was named to the position in December 2018. Indeed, Trump had been eyeing the change for many months, according to people familiar with his thinking, but wanted to wait until after the impeachment saga was over to make his move.

130,08-3-20,"Death toll crosses 3,000 in China","China has reported 28 new fatalities from the deadly coronavirus outbreak, taking the death toll in the country to 3,070, Chinese health officials said on Saturday as the rapid spread of the epidemic hit a milestone, infecting more than 1,00,000 people globally.

The virus that first emerged in China in December last year has spread to 97 countries and has infected 102,180 people, including 80,651 in China, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus tracker.

China’s National Health Commission (NHC) on Saturday said it received reports of 99 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection and 28 deaths on Friday on the Chinese mainland.

The 28 deaths were all reported in the virus epicentre Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan, the NHC said.

Meanwhile, 99 new suspected cases were reported it said, a significant milestone in China’s over two-month-long fight against the dreaded virus as the cases have for the first time dropped below 100. The overall confirmed cases on the mainland have reached 80,651 by the end of Friday. This included 3,070 people who had died of the virus, 22,177 patients still undergoing treatment and 55,404 others who were discharged after recovery, the NHC said.

Also on Friday, 24 imported cases (people coming to China from abroad) of the novel coronavirus infection were reported on the mainland, including 17 in Gansu Province, three in Beijing, three in Shanghai and one in Guangdong Province. By the end of Friday, 60 imported cases were reported, the NHC said.

By the end of Friday, 107 confirmed cases, including two deaths have been reported in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in the Macao SAR, and 45 in Taiwan, including one death have been reported.

While the cases of the COVID-19 in China are on the decline about 19,700 more cases were reported globally taking the overall total of the cases, including from China to over a lakh, state-run CGTN reported.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday that additional five countries — the Philippines, New Zealand, Ireland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia — have seen local transmission of the COVID-19.

Outside China, a total of 97 countries and regions have reported.

Bhutan, Cameroon, Serbia and South Africa have reported cases of the COVID-19 for the first time in the past 24 hours as of Friday morning, the WHO report said.

Meanwhile, Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme said there is no evidence right now suggesting the COVID-19 will disappear in summer, urging countries to fight the new virus decisively at the current stage.

“We do not know yet what the activity or behaviour of the virus will be in different climatic conditions,” Ryan said, warning against the assumption that the virus would just disappear on its own in the summertime like influenza,” state-run Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/death-toll-crosses-3-000-in-china.html
131,08-3-20,Saudi detains 3 royal princes over ‘coup plot’: Reports,"Saudi authorities have detained three princes, including King Salman’s brother and nephew on charges of plotting a coup, the US media reported Friday, signalling a further consolidation of power by the kingdom’s de facto ruler.

The detentions cast aside the last vestiges of potential opposition to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and come as the kingdom limits access to Islam’s holiest

sites in a highly sensitive move to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch’s nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were accused of treason and taken from their homes early Friday by black-clad royal guards, the Wall Street Journal reported citing unnamed sources.

The Saudi royal court has accused the two men, once potential contenders for the throne, of “plotting a coup to unseat the king and crown prince” and could face lifetime imprisonment or execution, the newspaper said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/saudi-detains-3-royal-princes-over----coup-plot-----reports.html
132,08-3-20,Kabul victims describe scenes of carnage after attack,"Kabul was reeling Saturday after Islamic State jihadists killed 32 people and wounded dozens more, with injured survivors describing scenes of terror as gunmen opened fire in the deadliest attack to hit Afghanistan since a US-Taliban deal.

The attack at a crowded gathering in the capital has raised questions about Afghanistan’s abysmal security situation and uncertain future following the February 29 agreement to pull foreign forces from the country within 14 months.

Lying in a hospital bed in a run-down Kabul neighbourhood, 15-year-old Basira said she had attended Friday’s annual commemoration ceremony for Abdul Ali Mazari — a politician from the Hazara ethnic group — for the first time, accompanied by her father and younger sister.

“We were in the middle of the ceremony when the gunfire erupted,” she told AFP in a frail voice. “It was non-stop firing for more than an hour,” she said, describing chaotic scenes, with terrified people running for cover from the gunmen who appeared to be shooting at them from a height.

As shrapnel tore into her right leg, she lost consciousness and was brought to a nearby hospital, along with 28 other wounded. The Sunni-extremist IS had claimed an attack on the same ceremony last year, which killed 11, and have in the past targeted Hazaras who are predominantly Shia Muslim.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/kabul-victims-describe-scenes-of-carnage-after-attack.html

134,08-3-20,Chennaiyin enter ISL final,"Two-time champions Chennaiyin FC booked their place in the final of the Indian Super League despite a 2-4 loss to a spirited FC Goa in the second leg of their semifinal at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Saturday.

Chennaiyin went through to the final 6-5 on aggregate, thanks to their 4-1 victory at home in the first leg.

FC Goa were dominant through the first half wherein Lucian Goian’s (10th) own goal and Mourtada Fall’s (21st) header gave the home side hopes of a comeback in the tie.

However, goals from Lallianzuala Chhangte (52nd) and Nerijus Valskis (59th) after the restart handed the initiative back to Chennaiyin FC. Though Edu Bedia (81st) and Fall (83rd) raised hopes of another comeback, Chennaiyin saw the game out in the end.

As expected, the home side came out all guns blazing, chasing a three-goal deficit from the first leg. The Gaurs were boosted by the return of Hugo Boumous and Brandon Fernandes from injuries but the first goal of the match came from an unlikely source.

FC Goa launched one attack after another right from the start and a good cross from the right flank by Jackichand Singh in the 10th minute undid the visitors’ defence. Lucian Goian met the cross at the near post and accidentally headed the ball into his own net.

With the deadlock broken, the home side took full control of the midfield and Chennaiyin struggled to string more than a few passes together.

FC Goa’s dream start was made even better when Brandon delivered a terrific cross into the centre of the box from the right-hand side. Mourtada Fall timed his leap to perfection and guided his header past Vishal Kaith and made it 2-0.

The home side were dominant throughout but were dealt a blow when Boumous picked up an injury midway through the first half. He was replaced by Edu Bedia but the change didn’t affect the dynamics of the game.

FC Goa started the second half just as they ended the first. Jackichand was at the end of a glorious chance to net FC Goa's third goal when Seriton’s cross from the right flank was cushioned into the path of the India winger by Corominas. The former Kerala Blasters forward scuffed his shot from close range and Kaith let out a huge sigh of relief.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/chennaiyin-enter-isl-final.html

The summit clash will he held at the SCA stadium in Khandheri from Monday. The stadium would be hosting the Ranji Trophy final for the first-time.

Pujara, who has played a 77 tests, will turn up for the hosts after a forgettable tour of New Zealand where the Indian batsmen were found in testing conditions.

The 17-member squad, led by star pacer Jaydev Unadkat, was announced by Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA) on Saturday. After the win over Gujarat in the semifinals, Unadkat had revealed that he was in constant touch with Pujara, who was in New Zealand.

The SCA had also wanted Ravindra Jadeja to feature in the final but the BCCI turned down its request saying “national duty” comes first.

136,08-3-20,"India, Indiaa","Women in Blue pitch for elusive trophy against hosts and habitual winners Australia

The Indian women’s team will have to overcome big match pressure as it aims to exorcise the ghosts of the past in the T20 World Cup Final against habitual winners Australia in front of a record crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground here on today.

India go into the Final unbeaten after topping the group stage where they had beaten the four-time champions Australia in the tournament-opener.

After the semifinal against England was washed out, the Harmanpreet Kaur-led squad advanced to their maiden summit clash, having finished first in Group A.

The refreshing firepower of 16-year-old Shafali Verma at the top and consistency of India's spin-heavy bowling attack has contributed massively to the team's success so far in the competition.

However, much more is needed from star batters Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet if India are to win their maiden ICC trophy.

The brittle middle-order too needs to deliver. And besides doing the right things on the field, India will also have to win the battle of nerves in the all important game.

Australia, who had beaten India in the preceding tri-series final, find themselves in familiar territory having made their sixth successive final in seven editions.

They know how to win the big moments in high-pressure games, while India have been found wanting on that front.

It may be a tad unfair on the teenager but the team will expect Shafali to provide another flying start and hope this time the experienced Mandhana too fires. There can’t be a bigger stage for Harmanpreet to be back amongst the runs and lead the team from the front.

If it was not for Shafali, India would have struggled to post competitive totals with the middle and lower-order doing precious little. The team did not cross the 150-run mark in the group stage but still managed to get over the line, thanks to a disciplined bowling effort.

Leggie Poonam Yadav has made a sensational comeback from a finger injury and is tournament’s leading wicket-taker with nine wickets alongside Australia pacer Megan Schutt.

Pacer Shikhar Pandey too has been impressive, while left-arm spin duo of Radha Yadav and Rajeshwari Gayakwad has kept things tight.

It will be interesting to see how Australians play Poonam on Sunday as the leggie was all over them in the tournament opener.

Australia, led by Meg Lanning, are backing themselves to win in front of the home fans though a sizable number of Indian fans too is expected at the iconic MCG.

Australia’s campaign has been hit by injuries to pacer Tayla Vlaeminck at the start and star all-rounder Elysse Perry was ruled out of the remainder of the tournament before the semifinal against South Africa.

Despite the twin setbacks, Australia have stormed into yet another title clash.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india--indiaa-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india--indiaa.html
137,08-3-20,Ankita shines with two wins as India creates Fed Cup history,"The Indian Fed cup team created history by progressing to the play-offs for the first time ever with Ankita Raina leading the side to a 2-1 win over Indonesia, here.

Ankita on Saturday night pulled off a crucial singles win against talented Aldila Sutjiadi to lock the tie 1-1 after Rutuja Bhosale suffered a crushing defeat against an unranked Priska Madelyn Nugroho.

Up against the 16-year-old Indonesian, who is ranked 15th on the ITF junior circuit, Rutuja lost 3-6 6-0 3-6 in one hour and 43 minutes in the opening singles. Ankita, who lost her previous two singles, demolished the challenge of Sutjiadi 6-3 6-3 in the second rubber.

She then combined with seasoned Sania Mirza to beat Sutziyadi and Nugroho 7-6(4) 6-0 to seal India's place in the play-offs where they will take on either Latvia or the Netherlands in April.

They overcame a sluggish start as they were trailing 1-4 but regrouped to dominate the decisive set.

India finished second in the six-team Group with four wins in a row after losing the opening tie to China, who remained unbeaten in the tournament.

Since earning their place back in Asia/Oceania Group I in 2016, India has remained in the regional group.

With the rise of Ankita, things began to improve.

Rutuja also played a key role as she provided winning starts in a few ties, sharing the burden with Ankita.

Sania's return to Fed Cup after four years also helped as her inspirational presence and guidance helped the side immensely.

India's non-playing captain Vishal Uppal is delighted with the result.

""It's a historic moment and to be part of it feels surreal. I am proud of each and every member of our team -- the players, physio, coach, manager. We all came together and worked towards a common goal,"" Uppal told PTI.

""The key was to do the fundamentals well and keep it simple on court. As a team everyone stepped up one day or the other which is very important. I hope this win will give a big boost to women's tennis in India.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ankita-shines-with-two-wins-as-india-creates-fed-cup-history-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ankita-shines-with-two-wins-as-india-creates-fed-cup-history.html

This is the first selection meeting under new chairman Sunil Joshi.

However, vice-captain Rohit Sharma is yet to fully recuperate from his calf muscle injury and is expected to return to action during the Indian Premier League later this month.

Pacer Shardul Thakur and all-rounder Shivam Dube were dropped from the squad that played the ODIs in New Zealand while veteran Kedar Jadhav made way for young Shubman Gill, who played his last ODI more than a year back.

Pandya's comeback was eagerly awaited by the team management after he underwent a back surgery. He proved his fitness with some blazing innings in the DY Patil Corporate T20 tournament under the watchful eyes of former chairman of selectors MSK Prasad.

Dhawan, who suffered a shoulder dislocation during Australia ODIs is also fit along with Bhuvneshwar, who underwent a sports hernia surgery in London.

Dhawan's comeback meant exit for Mayank Agarwal, who wasted three chances in New Zealand while Prithvi Shaw's positive batting has won him the vote of team management which enabled him to retain his place in the side.

141,08-3-20,T20 WC notches world record attendance for a women's cricket match,"The ICC Women's T20 World Cup final broke the world record attendance for a womens cricket match as 86,714 watched Australia beat India at the MCG here on Sunday.

The attendance also marked the highest attendance for a women's sporting event in Australia as the hosts won their fifth T20 World title in front of a home crowd.

The women's and men's T20 World Cups are being held in the same year as standalone events for the first time in 2020.

Five years in the making, the most highly-anticipated occasion in the sport's history lived up to its billing by setting a new attendance record not just for a women's sporting event in Australia, but for women's cricket globally.

It may have fallen just short of beating the world record attendance for a women's sporting fixture, but 86,174 fans filling the iconic MCG is a sight for any sports fan to behold.

In the six previous editions of the tournament, the highest final crowd came in 2009 when 12,717 watched England beat New Zealand in Sydney.

And seeing 73,000 more turn up in Melbourne for the same event 11 years later is a true testament to how far the game has come.

""I never thought I'd be playing in front of a crowd like this,"" said Australia's Ashleigh Gardner.

""It was amazing to have all those people before us.""

142,08-3-20,Leipzig draw blank at Wolfsburg,"RB Leipzig dropped more points in the Bundesliga title race after labouring to a 0-0 draw at Wolfsburg on Saturday.

Leipzig missed the goal threat of Timo Werner, who started the game on the bench after overcoming a muscular problem during the week.

Despite being subbed on in the 60th minute, Werner —who has 21 goals for RB in the Bundesliga this season — failed to make an impact in a dour encounter with few chances for either side, marking just the third time this season that Leipzig have failed to get on the scoresheet.

Second-placed Leipzig could finish the weekend five points behind Bayern if the leaders beat Augsburg on Sunday.

At the BayArena, Bayer Leverkusen dominated Eintracht Frankfurt 4-0 to jump up to fourth in the table.

German football's golden boy Kai Havertz opened the scoring in the fourth minute with his sixth of the season, tapping in a cross from Moussa Diaby. Karim Bellarabi scored the home side's second just 10 minutes later when chipping in from close range.

Leverkusen’s teenage Brazilian forward Paulinho added two more in a five-minute period midway through the second half, both a direct product of Bayer’s commitment to counter-pressing and counter-attacking under coach Peter Bosz.

Schalke and Hoffenheim fought out a 1-1 draw at the Veltins Arena. American midfielder Weston McKennie scored just his second goal from 67 Bundesliga appearances when his left-footed drive put his side 1-0 up in the 20th minute.

Hoffenheim levelled in the 69th minute through Christoph Baumgartner.

Elsewhere, relegation-threatened Werder Bremen held on for a 2-2 draw away at Hertha Berlin. Bremen flew out of the blocks to chalk up a 2-0 lead after just six minutes with goals through Josh Sargent and Davy Klaassen.

Niklas Stark pulled one back for the home side when heading in Marvin Plattenhardt's free-kick on 41 minutes, before a 60th-minute tap-in from Matheus Cunha drew the scores level.

Hertha were awarded a penalty in the dying stages for handball, but it was overruled after a VAR review.

Freiburg kept their hopes for European football alive with a dominant 3-1 home win over Union Berlin. Freiburg’s Roland Sallai broke the deadlock in the 34th minute, before captain Christian Guenter doubled the lead in the 55th minute, deceiving Union defender Neven Subotic to smash the ball past keeper Rafal Gikiewicz.

Sebastian Andersson gave the visitors hope in the 61st minute, scoring his 11th goal of the campaign to make it 2-1. Freiburg’s Robin Koch put the game beyond doubt in the 82nd minute, firing the ball into the hands of Gikiewicz who spilled the ball over the line.

143,08-3-20,Harman excited to play in front of record crowd,"A forced eight-day break has affected India’s preparations going into the Women’s T20 World Cup final on Sunday but the team is ready to rise to occasion in front a record crowd at the MCG, said skipper Harmanpreet Kaur.

An unbeaten run in the group stage propelled India into their maiden T20 World Cup summit clash after their last-four clash against England was washed out on Thursday.

India had defeated Sri Lanka in their last game on Saturday, followed by a semifinal washout, which meant the visitors haven’t played for the last eight days and Harmanpreet conceded her team has been ‘restless’.

“We haven’t been outdoors much and we didn't manage to play the important game against England,” said Kaur on the eve of the final against record four-time champions Australia.

“We were all in touch and doing indoor training, but it doesn’t give you full confidence because the surface is totally different. Everyone was in good touch and thinking what they can do for the team.

“We did get rest also because when you're playing for a long time, you need a break. No-one wanted to take rest, everyone was so keen, everyone was on the ground and ready to deal with the situation.”

Over 75,000 tickets have been sold for the finals and Harmanpreet said her team will look to enjoy the big stage and play positive cricket.

“It's a great feeling. It's the first time we're going to see 90,000 people in the stadium and we're really looking positive for that,” said Harmanpreet, who has played in front of a sold-out crowd in the 2017 Cricket World Cup Final against England at Lord’s.

“We are used to playing when a lot of crowd is around us. Sometimes there’s no noise going around in the stadium so we need to keep an eye on each of us. It’s a big moment.

“Rather than thinking about what is going to trouble us, it's only about being there, enjoying the moment and giving our best.”

“One thing, we have to keep in mind Sunday is a fresh day, a fresh start. We have to start from ball one,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/harman-excited-to-play-in-front-of-record-crowd.html

The 28-year-old Indian has emerged as India’s wrecker-in-chief in tournament with nine wickets, including a four-wicket haul against defending champions Australia in the opening match.

“When I got hit for a six in the first over, she (Harmanpreet) came to me and said, ‘Poonam, you’re one of the most experienced players in the team, and we expect better from you’,” Poonam was quoted as saying by the ICC.

“So, that kind of stirred something within me. I told myself if my captain has that much faith in me, I should be able to make a comeback.

“I took a wicket in the very next ball, and didn’t look back since. Now when I look back at that moment, it means so much in the context of my individual performance and run to the Final,” said the bowler from Agra.

Poonam said she used her time on the sidelines to analyse the weakness of her opponents which came handy during the World Cup.

“When I was on the sidelines, I worked quite hard knowing the quality of competition in the World Cup.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/captain---s-words-stirred-me-up--poonam.html
145,08-3-20,3 more wins,"Liverpool moved to within nine points of claiming the Premier League title by coming from behind to beat Bournemouth 2-1 as Arsenal boosted their charge towards the Champions League places with a 1-0 win over West Ham.

Jurgen Klopp’s men had suffered three defeats in four games in all competitions, including their first in the Premier League for 45 matches at Watford last weekend.

Callum Wilson’s controversial early opener threatened another major upset. But all of Liverpool's setbacks of late have come away from Anfield and they set an English top-flight record for 22 consecutive home league wins as two quickfire goals from Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane turned the game around.

The runaway league leaders still needed a miraculous goal-line clearance from James Milner to deny Ryan Fraser an equaliser, but defeat leaves Bournemouth still marooned in the bottom three.

“We are not geniuses, but we can really fight and that's all we have to do until the end of the season and see what we get from it,” said Klopp.

-Arsenal close on Chelsea

The spread of coronavirus could have a big impact on the Reds’ title celebrations in the weeks to come with the possibility of games being played behind closed doors.

But the abandonment of the normal pre-match ritual of handshakes was the only disruption to the Premier League calendar this weekend

Despite the coronavirus risk there was no halt to players celebrating wildly with each other and Arsenal players piled on top of Alexandre Lacazette after a long VAR review of the Frenchman’s winner at the Emirates.

West Ham were made to rue a series of missed chances as they remain just outside the relegation zone on goal difference.

Jarrod Bowen hit the woodwork and Bernd Leno made a string of saves from Michail Antonio and Sebastien Haller, but it was Arsenal who made the breakthrough 12 minutes from time.

Mesut Ozil was originally flagged offside as he latched onto Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's deflected shot and headed down for Lacazette to sweep home.

But the goal was finally given after a delay of several minutes to move Arsenal to within five points of the top four.

Wolves missed the chance to move into the top four as a disappointing 0-0 draw at home to Brighton left them still two points adrift of Chelsea in fifth.

A vital point for the Seagulls edges them two points clear of the relegation zone.

Sheffield United moved above Manchester United and Tottenham into sixth to further their dreams of Champions League football next season thanks to captain Billy Sharp’s winner to beat bottom-of-the-table Norwich 1-0.

Roy Hodgson celebrated his new contract as Crystal Palace boss with a 1-0 win over Watford as the Eagles moved into the top half of the table.

Newcastle also secured the win that should guarantee their survival courtesy of Allan Saint-Maximin's strike to beat 10-man Southampton 1-0.

Moussa Djenepo gave the Saints a mountain to climb when he was shown a straight red card for a lunge of Isaac Hayden on 28 minutes.

Alex McCarthy kept Southampton in the game as he saved Matt Ritchie’s penalty, but Saint-Maximin stabbed home the winner 11 minutes from time to take the Magpies eight points clear of the drop zone.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/3-more-wins.html
146,08-3-20,Spin plan for Indian attack,"Australia are focussing not only on the wily Poonam Yadav but preparing to take on India’s spin-heavy attack by practising against “slow spinners” ahead of Women’s T20 World Cup final.

Poonam had bamboozled Australia in the opening game, snapping four wickets to power India to a 17-run win but skipper Meg Lanning urged her side to brace up for other threats including the left-arm Indian bowlers.

“It’s not just Poonam we need to worry about. They’ve got some really good left-armers too, such as Rajeshwari Gayakwad. They’ve got a really strong line-up right through their bowlers and they have spinners who can change their pace,” Lanning said.

“We will be facing some slow spinners at training. We’ll be as prepared as we can be and making sure we adjust to what’s happening at the time.”

India’s batting also boasts of young Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana besides all-rounder Deepti Sharma and Lanning said her bowling unit has to make the necessary adjustments when coming across India's good batting unit.

“Obviously Smriti Mandhana is a world-class player too and Deepti Sharma has also played well against us. We feel our bowling line-up can adjust to different things,” she said.

“We are very well prepared for what the game will throw at us. It’s going to be a tough, hard battle today against India but I feel we are as ready as we can be to take it on.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/spin-plan-for-indian-attack.html
147,08-3-20,‘Australia need to play mind games to stop Shafali’,"Defending champions Australia need to play mind games to stop a rampaging Shafali Verma during women’s T20 World Cup final against India, believes England opener Danni Wyatt.

The 16-year-old Shafali has been the star of the tournament, having amassed 161 runs at a strike rate of 161, consistently providing India solid starts.

“It’s obvious what her weaknesses are and Shafali knows what they are. The Aussies have tried to bowl to those areas in the past. You’ve got to play a few mind games with her and hope she spoons one up,” said Wyatt.

She shared the dressing room with the Indian star at the 2019 Women’s T20 Challenge.

“When she fails, she’s so hard on herself. I just tell her to relax and that it’s only cricket.

“When you’re opening the batting in T20, it can be brutal because your role is to go hard and you’re always going to fail. She’s very hard on herself when she does,” she added.

Wyatt said it was Shafali’s brutal hitting against the pacers from the men’s team during a net session which convinced her about the Indian’s phenomenal talent.

“Even before the session, she’d go to the nets for extra practice against our quickest male bowlers,” recalled Wyatt.

“She’d bat for about an hour. She’d say ‘yeah, come bowl’ and go ‘bang, bang.’ And I went ‘who’s that?’

“She had an extra 20 minutes to do some drills after. I couldn’t believe she was 15 when someone told me. She knew exactly what she wanted to get out of that session. At aged 15, that’s pretty smart.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---australia-need-to-play-mind-games-to-stop-shafali---.html
148,08-3-20,Jaffer calls it day,"Former India opener Wasim Jaffer on Saturday announced retirement from all forms of cricket after amassing a mountain of runs in a glorious first-class career that spanned almost a quarter century.

Since making his first-class debut in 1996/97, the 42-year-old became the highest run-scorer in the Ranji Trophy and Irani Trophy, besides scoring close to 2000 runs with five centuries in Test cricket.

“After all these years in cricket, it is time to move on. But just like the red ball format which is very dear to me, it’s the end of only the first innings,” Jaffer said in a statement.

“I am looking forward to the second innings in any capacity, be it in coaching, commentary etc., as long as I stay involved with the game as this game has given me so much.”

He remembered those who helped him shape his career, his life.

“A special thanks to all my coaches, right from my school days to professional cricket, for helping me polish my skills. A heartfelt thanks to the selectors who showed faith in me.”

The Mumbaikar leaves the scene as the only batsman to score 12,000 runs in Ranji Trophy and he also has the highest number of first-class hundreds to his name.

Internationally, Jaffer played 31 Tests, scoring 1,944 runs at an average of 34.11. Besides five tons, he has 11 fifties in the highest format of the game, with 212 being his best.

“First of all, I would like to thank The Almighty Allah, who gave me the talent to play this beautiful game.

“I’d like to also thank my family - my parents and brothers for encouraging me to pursue the sport as a profession and my wife, who left the cosy life of England to create a lovely home for our children and me,” Jaffer said.

“I am honoured to have shared the dressing room with the likes of Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble, VVS Laxman, Virender Sehwag, and MS Dhoni to name a few,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/jaffer-calls-it-day.html

The agency is likely to carry out searches in Mumbai soon, according to sources who did not wish to be identified.

It is alleged that DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd, a firm linked to the Kapoor family, had allegedly received funds of Rs 600 crore when Yes Bank had an exposure of more than Rs 3,000 crore loans to the scam-hit DHFL, which is already under probe, they said.

Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) has already been booked by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for siphoning off over Rs 2,200 crore of PF funds of Uttar Pradesh power sector employees.

It is alleged that the bank did not make enough efforts to recover the funds and the funds received by DoIT Ventures are suspected to be kickbacks for the lenient attitude of the bank, the sources said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account, and superseded the board of the private sector lender with immediate effect.

Kerala Health Minister K K Shailaja said the state has been put on high alert in the wake of the new cases, reported more than a fortnight after India's first three coronavirus patients -medical students from Wuhan- were discharged from hospitals in the state.

The minister said all the passengers who travelled with the infected family in the Venice-Doha Qatar airlines QR 126 flight on February 29 and Qatar Airlines flight QR514 from Doha to Kochi that arrived at 8.20 am on March 1 should get in touch with health authorities.

154,08-3-20,"Rahul Gandhi most acceptable leader in Cong, high time he came back as party chief: Ajay Maken","Amid uncertainties over the leadership issue, senior Congress leader and former Union minister Ajay Maken has said it is high time Rahul Gandhi comes back as party president as he is the most acceptable leader. The former president of the Congress' Delhi unit, Maken, in an interview to PTI, also batted for veterans to gradually make way for younger leaders, saying if parties do not change their leadership with time, then people change parties.

Vouching for Rahul Gandhi as Congress chief, he said there is no other face as acceptable as Rahul who also has good intent at heart, zero baggage and consistently takes an aggressive stand in fighting against the might of the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Maken also argued for a long-term advisory role for interim president Sonia Gandhi saying her experience and expertise in handling Congress affairs would be much needed by the new president.

The party constitution can be amended to ensure that, he said.

""I think it is high time Rahul Gandhi came back. I am saying this with very strong conviction and strong reasons behind this. Rahul Gandhi is universally acceptable in the Congress party. There is no other face who is as much acceptable as Rahul Gandhi is,” Maken said.

“So, a person who is universally acceptable, no baggage, good intent at heart and who has been consistent and most aggressive against the BJP and Modi, and has been the voice amplifier of farmers, Dalits and minorities. I think, he single-handedly deserves to be Congress president,” he said.

Asked about what would be the right time for Rahul Gandhi to return, Maken said, “the sooner, the better, because it will end uncertainty.”

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also said Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah are deeply wary of the unwavering conviction and fearlessness with which Rahul Gandhi has taken on the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

""Rahul Gandhi has adequately proved his mettle. Time has come to rise above the parochial issues of regional leadership and work towards strengthening and rebuilding the Congress. Needless to add that Rahul Gandhi is the obvious and only choice to lead the Congress,"" he said.

Maken noted that the country needs a person with ""good intent at heart, not good content in speech"".

""We have seen the country is paying the price to just follow good content in speech and the present situation where our country is in, the economy is in doldrums, there is a social strife, the riots going on in the national capital and the government not doing anything, is just because the people voted for good content in speech of Narendra Modi. They never saw the intent at heart of the leader,"" the Congress leader said.

Commenting on the old versus young debate in the Congress, Maken strongly argued for gradual change of guard in the party and said parties must change their leadership in time.

“I am among the biggest supporters for change, but it has to be gradual. It can't be in one big sudden change. But it has to be there. That change is required because if the parties don't change their leadership in time, then the people change the parties,” he said, adding that the electorate wants change.

On whether Congress veterans will be given an advisory role, he said it should be voluntary and not be imposed on them, as has happened in the case of party veterans in the BJP.

On voices backing organisational elections in the Congress, Maken said elections to the post of party president and working committee members alone would not help, and an overall organisational poll from bottom to up is needed.

“Only elections for the president or the working committee will not empower the workers,” said Maken.

He noted that Rahul Gandhi has championed holding elections not only for the working committee, and president, but a series of elections at all levels in a transparent manner.

“That is what Rahul Gandhi has always stood for. He has wanted transparent elections throughout and even ticket distribution should be held through primaries and elections, where workers should decide who should be given the ticket,” Maken said.

On the Congress suffering two general election setbacks under Rahul Gandhi, he said as far as winning and losing elections is concerned, this is part of the process.

“How many elections under Atal Bihari Vajpayee did the BJP had win. In the 1990s the Vajpayee-Advani duo always used to lose election. The BJP never threw their leaders out of the party, as it was, they who got the BJP into power,” the former Union minister said.

Maken also called for spelling out clearly the Congress' ideology on issues of social, economic and nationalism, to avoid leaders speaking in different voices in public on key issues.

""We should have firmly laid down our ideological stand on key issues, as this would end any kind of confusion and it would also help Congress workers to have their loyalty and allegiance towards a particular philosophy or ideology,"" he said.

Maken also said the Congress lost ground in Delhi because it stopped attacking Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal starting January 2019.

“BJP's polarisation agenda also helped the AAP,” he said, rejecting the widely held belief that the Congress, under a deliberate electoral strategy, vacated the Delhi turf for the AAP.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rahul-gandhi-most-acceptable-leader-in-cong--high-time-he-came-back-as-party-chief--ajay-maken-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/rahul-gandhi-most-acceptable-leader-in-cong--high-time-he-came-back-as-party-chief--ajay-maken.html

156,08-3-20,SBI finalises bailout for ailing Yes Bank,"To own 245 cr shares worth Rs 2,450 cr; depositors’ money safe

As part of its effort for a speedy resolution of the Yes Bank crisis and protect the interest of depositors, the Government has decided to rely on the State Bank of India (SBI) to pilot the distressed private sector lender through the turbulent times. The SBI will acquire 49 per cent stake in the Yes Bank for which it will be issued 245-crore shares at a price of Rs 10 each for Rs 2,450 crore.

To provide a sense of security and continuity to any prospective investor , the SBI will not reduce its holding below 26 per cent before completion of three years from the date of infusion of the capital, the country’s largest lender said in a statement. It further said the new board of Yes Bank will have CEO and MD, non-executive chairman and non-executive directors.

“All the employees of the reconstructed bank shall continue service with the same remuneration and on the same terms and conditions... At least for a period of one year,” the SBI said. Addressing the media earlier in the day, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar clearly outlined what the public sector giant formally decided. Kumar said the SBI has set a maximum investment limit of Rs 10,000 crore, which could be provided as a long term soft loan to the Yes Bank.

He said involvement of the SBI in resolving the crisis at the private lender will allay fears of investors and depositors. “Today if the resolution has to happen, you need a credible name with the investors, creditors and depositors of the bank. With the SBI standing behind it, there will be stability in the financial market,” he said and assured depositors that their money is safe. The draft scheme of reconstruction of Yes Bank came a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a moratorium on the bank, restricting withdrawals to Rs 50,000 per depositor till April 3. The RBI also superseded the board of the bank, which is now being headed by former deputy managing director and CFO of SBI Prashant Kumar.

Kumar said if the SBI becomes the sole investor in the bank and picks up 49 per cent stake, then the immediate investment requirement would be Rs 2,450 crore. “I have already set the (investment) boundary of Rs 10,000 crore,” Kumar told reporters here. The cap of Rs 10,000 crore is based on the assumption of higher capital requirement by the bank, he added. Yes Bank has been struggling to raise capital. It sought to raise $2 billion initially during this fiscal, which was then pruned to $1.2 billion as it could not rope in any investor.

Kumar said the SBI has received the draft scheme of reconstruction and its investment and legal teams are doing their due diligence of the scheme.

“Once we complete our due diligence, we will go back to the RBI with our comments,” he said.

The suggestions and comments on the scheme have to be given to the RBI by March 9, 2020, after which a final call will be taken by the central bank.

Kumar further said many potential investors have approached the SBI after seeing the draft scheme of reconstruction of Yes Bank.

“For Yes Bank, people have reached out to us. These are all initial discussions. Our investment team will discuss with them and work out the possibilities,” he said.

In a rare move, the RBI late on Thursday (March 5) placed Yes Bank under a 30-day moratorium and placed a withdrawal cap of Rs 50,000 on individual depositors.

Kumar said the effort will be that the resolution plan is approved and implemented before the timeline set by the RBI. He also said the proposed plan will not have any impact on SBI’s balance sheet.

“There is a very marginal impact on bank’s capital adequacy ratio. As a policy, we maintain all ratios 50 basis points above the minimum regulatory requirement. We will continue to do that without any further raising of the capital from the market and there is no question of requesting the government for any capital,” he said.

Even the interest of SBI’s shareholders will not be compromised under the plan, he said. SBI’s investment in the private sector lender will not lead to conflict of interest, he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sbi-finalises-bailout-for-ailing-yes-bank-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sbi-finalises-bailout-for-ailing-yes-bank.html
157,08-3-20,Five more persons from Kerala test positive for corona virus,"Five more people from Kerala, three with recent travel history to Italy, have tested positive for coronavirus following which the state has been put on high alert, Health Minister K K Shailaja said here on Sunday.

The three, a couple and their son, had evaded health screening at the airport on their return about a week ago and all the five hail from Ranni in Pathnamthitta district, she said.

""As of now their condition is stable. But there is need to take extra care"", the minister said.

The fresh cases have been reported days after the southern state had successfully treated India's first three coronavirus patients -medical students from Wuhan- who have been discharged from hospitals.

Their home quarantine period is also over.

While the three, a couple in their fifties and their 24-year old son, had taken a flight from Italy to India on February 29, two others affected are their relatives, the minister said.

As a matter of abundant caution, two nonagenerian members of the family will be shifted to the Kottayam Medical College hospital, she added.

The three, who had returned from Venice, had not informed authorities that they had come back from Italy.

When two of their relatives had sought treatment at private and taluk hospitals with virus symptoms, the health authorities came to know about the travel history of the people who returned to Italy.

They had evaded screening at the airport and were reluctant to get admitted at the hospital initially, she said adding they had at first refused to cooperate with health officials and were forcefully admitted to the isolation ward of the Pathnamathitta general hospital and are under observation.

They were admitted to hospital on March 6 and their tests had been confirmed on Saturday night, she said.

""The Italy-returned family hid their travel details from the health authorities. Such practises have to seen as a crime. Those who come from countries like Iran, Italy, South Korea and China should report to the health department immediately,"" Shailaja said.

The government also released the flight details of the three persons who travelled from Venice.

They took the Venice-Doha Qatar airlines QR 126 flight on February 29 which reached at 11.30 pm.

For one and half hours they were at the Doha airport and took another Qatar Airlines flight QR514 to Kochi and arrived at 8.20 am on March 1 and took a private car to their home at Pathnamthitta district.

All the passengers who travelled in the two flights should get in touch with health authorities, the minister said.

The report of the five new cases comes a day ahead of ""Attukal Pongal"" festival in Kerala on Monday when thousands of women from various parts of Kerala and outside, including foreigners are expected to participate.

160,08-3-20,ED arrests Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor under PMLA,"The Enforcement Directorate arrested Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor under money laundering charges here in the early hours of Sunday, officials said.

The banker was held under the provision of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) around 3 am as he was allegedly not cooperating in the probe, they said.

Kapoor's arrest at the ED office in Ballard Estate followed over 20 hours of questioning by the central agency after it raided his residence on Friday night.

The arrest comes after charges of alleged financial irregularities and mismanagement in the operations of the private bank surfaced and the RBI and Union government initiated action to control its affairs.

Officials said Kapoor, 62, will be produced before a local court during the day to obtain custody.

The investigating officer of the case had recorded Kapoor's statement under the PMLA when he was first interrogated on Friday night at his upscale residence in 'Samudra Mahal' complex in Worli area here.

He was brought to the ED office on Saturday noon for a fresh round of questioning.

On Saturday, the agency widened its probe in the case as the premises of Kapoor's three daughters in Delhi and Mumbai were searched to gather more information and evidence.

According to officials, Kapoor's wife Bindu and daughters -- Rakhee Kapoor Tandon, Roshni Kapoor and Radha Kapoor -- are allegedly linked to some companies to which the suspected ""proceeds of crime"" have been traced.

The case against Kapoor is linked to the scam-hit DHFL as the loans lent by the bank to the company allegedly turned NPAs, they said.

A Rs 600 crore worth loan extended by the DHFL to an entity is also at the centre of the ED probe, officials said.

The central agency is also probing Kapoor's role in connection with the disbursal of loans to some corporate entities and the subsequent alleged kickbacks reportedly received in his wife's accounts.

Other alleged irregularities are also under the agency's scanner including the one related to the alleged PF fraud in the Uttar Pradesh power corporation, they added.

The CBI has recently taken over investigation into the Rs 2,267-crore Employees' Provident Fund fraud in Uttar Pradesh, where hard-earned savings of power sector employees were invested in Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL).

The ED action came after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account, and superseded the board of the private sector lender with immediate effect.

Yes Bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

As per the RBI's draft reconstruction scheme, State Bank of India will pick up 49 per cent stake in the crisis-ridden Yes Bank under a government-approved bailout plan.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ed-arrests-yes-bank-founder-rana-kapoor-under-pmla-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/ed-arrests-yes-bank-founder-rana-kapoor-under-pmla.html

Opting to bat, Australia rode on blistering half-centuries by openers Alyssa Healy (75) and Beth Mooney (78 not out) to post 184 for four before their bowlers, led by Megan Schutt (4/18) and Jess Jonassen (3/20), put up a disciplined effort to win their fifth title.

Chasing a challenging target, India, featuring in their maiden final of the tournament, couldn't handle the pressure and were bundled out for 99 in 19.1 overs.

India suffered a batting collapse as the top order of teen sensation Shafali Verma (2), Smriti Mandhana (11), Jemimah Rodrigues (0) and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (4) departed inside the first six overs.

To add to India's woes, wicket-keeper Taniya Bhatia retired hurt in the second over after getting hit on her helmet of the bowling of left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen.

164,08-3-20,PC slams Modi Govt for blaming Congress,"Accuses Centre of financial mismanagement

Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Saturday slammed the Narendra Modi Government for blaming the Congress for Yes Bank’s fiasco and pointed out that though bank’s loan ballooned up after 2014 it was not noticed by any regulatory authority due to “mismanagement” of financial institutions under the BJP-led Centre.

He demanded that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) conduct a probe and fix accountability in the matter.

Chidambaram pointed out that the Yes Bank’s loan book swelled from Rs 55,633 crore in 2014 to Rs 2,41,499 crore in 2019. “The loan book was allowed to grow despite the RBI and the Government supervision at a rate of 35 per cent per year and the spike happened in 2016-17 and 2017-18 — the two years immediately following demonetisation,” he added.

“Yes Bank indulging in loan giving spree isn’t banking but buccaneering,” he said, adding, “How no officer of the RBI noticed a 35 per cent jump in the loan book of the bank in a year, when loan books of other banks were growing at nine per cent. This is a matter that must be thoroughly enquired into and accountability fixed,” he told reporters.

“...Notice the spike in 2016-17 and 2017-18, the two years immediately following demonetisation. Is no one in the RBI or Government accountable,” he asked.

He also said it was “bizarre” for the State Bank of India to invest Rs 2,450 crore to pick up a 49 per cent stake in the crisis-ridden bank under a Government-approved bailout plan.

The Congress leader said whoever takes over the bank, it must ensure that depositors’ money is safe and every depositor is assured of his/her money, as the depositors are the most innocent ones.

The former Finance Minister asked a series of questions to the Government over the Yes Bank crisis.

“Which committee or who authorised the grant of new loans after March 2014? Were not the RBI and Government aware that YES Bank was on a loan-giving spree? It was not banking but buccaneering. Did no one in the RBI and the Government read the balance sheet of the bank at the end of every year?” he asked.

Chidambaram also asked why did nothing change after the Yes Bank CEO was replaced and a new one appointed in January 2019 and why did nothing change after a former deputy Governor of RBI was appointed to the Board of Yes Bank in May 2019.

“Why did the alarm bells not ring when Yes Bank reported its first-ever quarterly loss in the quarter Jan-March 2019,” he asked.

Chidambaram said the Government and the Finance Minister would wish the story to vanish from the media, but despite their best efforts, mismanagement of financial institutions by the BJP Government will be an issue that will remain in the public domain and be debated extensively.

“The best judge of the management of the economy is the market - not the FM nor any ex-FM nor any newspaper. Even allowing for the effect of the coronavirus threat, it is noteworthy that yesterday Sensex fell by 884 points,” Chidambaram said.

He noted that the price of an SBI share fell by Rs 18 and the Rupee to USD declined by 54 paisa (-0.74 per cent). “The price of Yes Bank share fell from Rs 36.80 to Rs 16.15,” he said, adding that “actually it is worthless”.

“I stated yesterday that a better option would be for SBI to take over, under orders of RBI, the loan book of Yes Bank at one rupee and an obligation to assure all depositors that their money is safe and will be returned. Simultaneously, the SBI should make every effort to recover as much as possible of the outstanding loans. There are other options that can be explored in consultation with former Governors C Rangarajan and YV Reddy,” the former Finance Minister said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pc-slams-modi-govt-for-blaming-congress-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/pc-slams-modi-govt-for-blaming-congress.html
165,08-3-20,"'How genes, environment influence coffee drinking decoded'","Scientists have revealed how genetic and environmental factors determine if a person needs one, or several cups of coffee to get through the day, a finding that may lead to better interventions for those attempting to abstain from the widely consumed beverage.

The study, published in the journal Behavior Genetics, noted that coffee addiction is affected by a positive feedback loop between genetics and the environment via a phenomenon known as quantile-specific heritability.

""It appears that environmental factors sort of set the groundwork in which your genes start to have an effect,"" said Paul Williams, study co-author from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) in the US.

""So, if your surroundings predispose you to drinking more coffee -- like your coworkers or spouse drink a lot, or you live in an area with a lot of cafes -- then the genes you possess that predispose you to like coffee will have a bigger impact,"" Williams said.

According to the Berkeley Lab scientist, these two effects are synergistic.

He said the phenomenon is also associated with cholesterol levels and body weight, and may play a role in other human physiological and behavioural traits like alcohol addiction.

As part of the study, Williams assessed 4,788 child-parent pairs and 2,380 siblings from the Framingham Study -- an ongoing research launched by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US in 1948 to investigate how lifestyle and genetics affect rates of cardiovascular disease.

In the Framingham Study, participants submitted detailed information about diet, exercise, medication use, and medical history every three to five years.

Based on this data, Williams used statistical methods to calculate what proportion of the participants' coffee drinking could be explained by genetics, and what must be influenced by external factors.

Earlier studies had shown that the most significant environmental factors influencing coffee drinking were culture and geographic location, age, sex, and whether or not one smokes tobacco.

The current assessment showed that between 36 and 58 per cent of coffee intake could be genetically determined -- although the exact set of causative genes remain unknown.

However, the study noted that the association between a parent's coffee drinking and an offspring's habit got increasingly stronger for each of the offspring's coffee consumption quantile, or bracket -- zero cups per day, one to two cups, two to four cups, or five or more cups.

""When we started to decode the human genome, we thought we'd be able to read the DNA and understand how genes translate into behaviour, medical conditions, and such. But that is not the way it's worked out,"" Williams said.

""For many traits, like coffee drinking, we know that they have a strong genetic component -- we've known coffee drinking runs in families since the 1960s. But, when we actually start looking at the DNA itself, we usually find a very small percentage of the traits' variation can be attributed to genes alone,"" he added.

In genetics research, Williams said, traditionally it is assumed that one's surroundings and lifestyle alter gene expression levels in consistent and measurable ways, creating the outward manifestation of a trait.

The current study noted that the situation is more complex, adding that the methods used to arrive at the findings may help explain the diversity of traits we see in the real world.

""This is a whole new area of exploration that is just now opening up. I think it will change, in a very fundamental way, how we think genes influence a person's traits,"" Williams said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-how-genes--environment-influence-coffee-drinking-decoded--2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/-how-genes--environment-influence-coffee-drinking-decoded-.html

All the 27 deaths occurred in the virus-hit central Hubei province, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said.

The confirmed cases for the first time fell below 50 since COVID-19 surfaced in Hubei province in January. Of the 44 new cases reported on Saturday, 41 were in Wuhan in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland has risen to 80,695 by the end of Saturday. The total number of deaths reached 3,097.

Over 20,500 patients were still undergoing treatment and 57,065 discharged after recovery, the NHC said.

Also on Saturday, three coronavirus cases in people arriving from abroad were reported, including two in Beijing and one in Gansu province. By the end of Saturday, 63 such cases had been reported, the NHC said.

By the end of Saturday, 109 confirmed cases including two deaths in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 45 in Taiwan including one death were reported.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Saturday that a total of 21,114 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported by 93 countries and regions outside China - an increase of 3,633 infections from the previous day.

The number of confirmed cases worldwide has risen to 101,927, the WHO said on Saturday.

Outside China, 78 more people died of COVID-19, bringing the total deaths to 413, Xinhua reported, quoting a WHO report.

According to WHO's daily situation report on Saturday, there has been 3,486 deaths worldwide due to the coronavirus.

Colombia, the Vatican, Peru, Togo and Slovakia have reported cases of COVID-19 for the first time in the past 24 hours, the WHO report said.

The world health body has revised the transmission classification of Iceland, Palestine and Cameroon from ""imported cases only"" to ""local transmission"", bringing the total number of countries and regions where local transmission emerged to 45 in addition to China.

It said the spread of COVID-19 can be significantly slowed or even reversed through implementing robust containment and control activities.

China and other countries are demonstrating that the spread of the virus can be slowed and impact reduced through the use of universally applicable actions, WHO said in a statement, referring to measures such as working across society to identify people who are sick, bringing them to care, following up on contacts, and training health workers.

It underlined that containing and slowing the spread of the virus helps buy time for health systems and all of society to prepare and for researchers to identify effective treatments and develop vaccines.

""Allowing uncontrolled spread should not be a choice of any government, as it will harm not only the citizens of that country but affect other countries as well,"" it said.

Biden, the 77-year-old former vice president, spoke to a large crowd of supporters in Missouri, one of six states that will hold Democratic primaries on Tuesday, one week after the ""Super Tuesday"" elections brought about a dramatic reversal of fortunes in his favor.

Standing on an outdoor stage on a sunny day in St Louis, at times wearing his signature aviator sunglasses, the politically moderate Biden savored his spectacular revival in the race for the White House.

""What a difference a day makes,"" he exulted. ""This time last week I was in South Carolina and the press and the pundits had declared Biden's campaign dead."" ""But South Carolina had something to say about that, and then came Super Tuesday.

And today there are 11 victories behind us and we're leading both in delegates and national votes."" With the monumental Gateway Arch -- a symbolic entryway to the American West -- in the background, the former vice president mentioned Sanders only indirectly.

Biden, having gained key backing from erstwhile rivals Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bloomberg, said he was best positioned to ""unite this party,"" promising not to turn ""this primary into a campaign of negative attacks."" ""That will only re-elect Donald Trump if we go that route,"" he said. Sanders, speaking to an equally enthusiastic crowd in Chicago, underlined his differences with Biden, without directly attacking him.

""Joe Biden is a friend,"" he said. ""I have known him for many years. But we have records, we have a different vision. The American people will hear about it."" With the primary now ""down to two people,"" the progressive Vermont senator said, ""it is important for the American people to understand the differences between us -- in terms of our record, in terms of our vision for the future."" Sanders is a democratic socialist who wears his uncompromising positions -- government-run health care for all, higher taxes on the wealthy and free university tuition -- proudly on his sleeve.

Biden is a centrist who prides himself on his ability to work with Republicans. He is more middle-of-the-road on key issues like health care, where he favors expanding existing insurance programs, and less punitive additional taxes on the wealthy.

In addition to Missouri, Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, North Dakota and Washington will hold Democratic primaries on Tuesday.

The state of Illinois, where Sanders was speaking, does not hold its primary until March 17.

That falls two days after the next Democratic debate, to be held in Phoenix, Arizona.

Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is still on Democratic ballots, but trails so badly that she has not qualified for the debate.

The agency is also probing Kapoor’s role in connection with the disbursal of loans to some corporate entities and the subsequent alleged kickbacks reportedly received in his wife’s bank accounts, sources said.

Other alleged irregularities, including the one related to the alleged PF fraud in the Uttar Pradesh power corporation is also under the scanner of the ED, they added.

The CBI has recently taken over investigation into the Rs 2,267-crore Employees’ Provident Fund fraud in Uttar Pradesh, where hard-earned savings of power sector employees were invested in Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL).

The ED action came after the Reserve Bank of India on Thursday imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account and superseded the board of the private sector lender with immediate effect.

Post-RBI intervention, the Yes Bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

As per the RBI’s draft reconstruction scheme, State Bank of India will pick up 49 per cent stake in the beleaguered Yes Bank under a government-approved bailout plan.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/ed-questions-founder-rana-for-2nd-day--raids-more-locations.html

174,08-3-20,It has great action,"Baaghi 3

*ing: Tiger Shroff, Shraddha Kapoor, Riteish Deshmukh, Ankita Lokhande, Jackie Shroff

Rated: 6/10

Let’s talk about things that doesn’t make any sense in the third edition of Baaghi, the first that hit the screens back in 2016. First, why would anybody suggest that a boy who would get beaten up and grows up to be timid should join the police force? Second, a brother (Tiger Shroff who pays Ronny) who swore to his dying father that he would always take care of his elder brother (Riteish Deshmukh who plays Vikram), why would he allow the said brother to go to Syria to set in motion extradition of one of the hardened criminals?

Third, why would, Ronny once Vikram disappear in Syria, as is expected, take his girlfriend (Sharaddha Kapoor) to this war-torn country? Four, who in their right mind give money to a pickpocketer just because he said that he steals for his brother? Five, the pickpocket after taking the pair to a secluded area with the intention to rob, does a about-turn? There is of course a six and and seven and an eight.

Despite the weak storyline, director Ahmed Khan has managed to cash in on the fact that Tiger Shroff has a great body — six abs and biceps — that would rival those of Salman Khan. The action here is lethal — figuratively and literally. The shot where he holds off three goons with his foot while he beats their leader is at least worth two whistles if not more .

But then junior Shroff has proved time and again that he is good when it comes to some great action what with him learning martial arts and has a black belt in Taekwondo. Then there is dancing. His knowledge of breakdancing, popping and locking comes in handy.

Watch this one if you love action and are a fan of Tiger Shroff.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/it-has-great-action-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/it-has-great-action.html
175,08-3-20,‘Want to do finite shows only’,"HARSHITA GAUR, who rose to fame with Sadda Haq on Channel V, speaks with SHALINI SAKSENA about her journey and Happily Ever After, a series on Zoom Studios

From being a model to an actor. How did the transition happen?

My stint as a model was for a short time only; I did only two-three advertisements. My professional career started as an actor. When people come to Mumbai, they all want is a break in Bollywood. This is because there is something fascinating about the industry. Everybody is waiting for that first call from a particular production house. I was no different. To begin with I didn’t want to do Sadda Haq. But now when I look back, I am so happy that I did it. There was no choice that I would do TV and then move on to films. You can’t decide these things; it happen organically. All that you can do is to decide whether the project that has come your way interests you or not.

How did your parents react when you said you wanted to be an actor?

When I told my parents that I wanted to go into acting, the idea was not met with a lot of resistance form my parents. They are doctors and supported me in my decision. They were only worried since they didn’t know anybody in the industry. They had never come to Mumbai. My mother was an actor, she did theatre for nine years. I was into a lot of dramatics in school and learnt Kathak since I was in Class III, so the inclination towards art was always there. I wanted to be part of Miss World but they don’t take people who are 5’4”.

You studied engineering and come from a family of doctors. How did acting happen?

My parents knew I was more interested in pursuing this line. They were a bit on the backfoot when I said I wanted to make it my profession. They insisted that I complete my education. They were very clear that they would not let me come to Mumbai on my own at age 18. If I had my way I would have been in the city at that age. But things fell in place. I was in college, then Sadda Haq happened. I was luckily that I had work when I came to Mumbai. My struggle in the industry happened after that show ended.

You have done TV, web series and films. Has it been a conscious decision to have a diverse portfolio?

There was only one conscious decision when I picked up projects — to do finite shows. When I did TV, it was almost infinite since it ran for almost two-and-a-half-years. I loved that show and it would stay with me forever and be that special one. After that I didn’t do any more TV because none of them were finite. I wanted to be part of stories that interested me and had a finite end. When the show ended in 2016, the OTT platforms were not so popular. I was looking for films. Then a South Indian film happened. With web coming in, it opened a lot of opportunities and Sacred Games and Mirzapur happened. Whatever choice you make can be right or wrong but as long as long as you like what you are doing it’s fine. I don’t want to take up projects because I want to make money.

What is you role in Happily Ever After?

My role is that of a civil engineer from a Punjabi family. She has been with this person and now they want to get married — a big fat Indian wedding. But the couple want to plan it on their own. So a budget comes in. But there are so many expenditures and that is when the problems happen. It is an interesting love story. There is a parallel story as well which shows how they met and fell in love.

What was the attraction?

I had not done this kind of role. I have done roles where my character is from a small town. I have not done a role where the character is suave. The genre was different as well. I also said yes because my friends during this period were getting married and the subject was relatable. Also I wanted to do something that was easy and fun after Mirzapur.

Do you personally believe in happily ever after?

First, there is no ever after, nothing ever ends. Even in a three hour film, there is no full stop. Being happy is a process. Problems will always be there, you sort it and move on. When two people want to be part of each other’s life, they should sort it out to be happily ever after.

So happily ever after is a fun series?

Yes. It has lot of fun and is very relatable. It is going to be an easy watch.

Was it tough to do comedy?

I have never done comedy. This is a genre that I had never done before. Even with Happily Every After, it is the situations that are comic mostly by co-actors. I am not doing comedy here. But it is a light show for me.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---want-to-do-finite-shows-only----2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/---want-to-do-finite-shows-only---.html

— Rishina Kandhari from Ishaaron Ishaaron Mein

I believe a woman’s zeal always outshines her own self .It signifies the spirit of women in our society today. All the women in my life have encouraged me to be where I am today and have helped me to chase my dreams. I want to thank and encourage every woman to celebrate the best version of herself each day.

— Kannika Kapur from Ek Duje Ke Vaste 2

As a woman in the arts, I can confidently say that change is afoot. Women are having access to roles they never would have seen a few years ago, while also being able to start and support movements that speak for their rights. I wish all the women out there a very happy women’s day.

— Akanksha Puri from Vighnaharta Ganesh

An ideal woman for me is one who believes in herself and believes in living her dreams and aspirations. I feel it's good that we have a day to celebrate women. Having said that, I also feel the world needs to celebrate women every single day. Every little moment and opportunity shouldn't be missed to appreciate and express gratitude towards the women in our lives.""

— Anita Raj from Choti Sarrdaarni

This Women's Day, I would like to urge all the women to fight for themselves and become stronger for themselves. Considering today's time, the scenario is very unsafe for women and nothing will change unless and until they safeguard their own selves. Family and friend's support is very important but they should not depend on them. Girls should feel strong from within to come out stronger to the world.

While Timnasa (Pavitra Punia) tries to take advantage of Baalveer’s loss of powers, all her attempts are destroyed by the mysterious Nakaabposh.

Vivaan and Debu are rescued but now the real question is — who is Nakaabposh?

Timnasa is determined in her efforts to know the truth about Nakaabposhwhile she is also reminded of the invisible power on Earth that is capable of killing her.

Pavitra Punia, playing the role of Timnasa said: “Timnasa doubted Baalveer to be Nakaabposh but she was left disappointed.

‘Chose the show for my wife’

We have all heard of stories about artists enacting different roles on television. Everyone has their own reasons to pursue specific roles, some prefer action-packed one while others prefer romantic parts basis their interest. Interestingly Sudhanshu Pandey who will be portraying the role of a typical husband in Star Plus’ upcoming show Anupamaa has a very different reason for selecting this role. The veteran actor took up the part of Vanraj in the show for his wife and has a rather fascinating story to narrate why he did so!

Speaking about his differential role in the upcoming show, Sudhanshu shared: “I have essayed different roles on TV and I have to say that the role of Vanraj stands out from the rest. When I got to know about the show and its engaging narrative, the first thought that struck me was that I have to do this! It’s a tribute to my wife who selflessly looks after me and our kids, always putting us first for everything. I would say that I dedicate it to all the homemakers who constantly strive for helping us achieve our goals in life. They are the real multi-taskers and I can’t imagine how will we ever be able to do anything in life without them!”

The show is a Hindi remake of Sreemoyee and is produced by Magic Moments, story by Leena Gangopadhyay. The show revolves around Anupamaa, a homemaker who dons multiple hats like any other and her life includes an endless amount of demands and to-dos. Anupamaa fulfills all the requests lovingly and happily out of the love she has for her family. The titular role of Anupamaa is essayed by popular television actor, Rupali Ganguly along with Sudhanshu Pandey as her husband in the show.

Get ready for torture week

India’s biggest stunt-based reality show Khatron Ke Khiladi is back on Colors. In its 10th season, the show seems to be bigger than ever and the episodes of the show are already being majorly appreciated by viewers.

179,08-3-20,"With 'Roar' and 'Firework', Katy Perry lights up Women's T20 World Cup final","It was raining 'fireworks' as singer Katy Perry rocked the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) with her powerful performance ahead of the final of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup here on Sunday.

Celebrating International Women's Day, the 35-year-old singer opened the finale between India and Australia with two of her biggest hits -- ""Roar"" and ""Firework"" and enthralled over 80,000 spectators at the prestigious stadium.

Perry, who announced her pregnancy last week, entered the ground in a pink-purple dress with oversized flaring sleeves, which was embossed with the gender symbol for women, the sign of equality and a lot of hearts. She completed her look with a top knot and pastel pink high boots.

She began her over 2 minute-long performance with her empowering anthem ""Roar"".

As she strutted across the ground, hundreds of cheerleaders flanked Perry with 'GRL PWR' (girl power) banners resembling lightning and back-up dancers wearing cricket bats with the singer's initials.

Towards the end of the first song, the singer carefully climbed on to the stage.

She later changed into a more snug purple outfit, showing off her baby bump, and set the stage alight with her another inspirational track, ""Firework"".

Hours before her performance, Perry met the two teams and shared a few pictures on social media.

""Hoping you're coming to celebrate these incredible women on #internationalwomensday with me @mcg! I'll be the one waddling about on stage with a sprained thumb @t20worldcup #womenneverquit #helpinghands,"" she wrote on Instagram.

Her fiance, ""Lord of the Rings"" alum Orlando Bloom, with whom she is expecting her first child, also gave her a shout-out as she geared up for her pregame show.

Bloom, 43, captioned Perry's picture as ""My babies blooming"".

182,08-3-20,"I don't believe in any religion, I only believe in being Indian: Akshay Kumar","Superstar Akshay Kumar says there is only one religion and that is ""being an Indian"", and his upcoming film ""Sooryavanshi"" reflects the same sentiment.

""Sooryavanshi"", directed by Rohit Shetty, is the latest movie in the filmmaker's cop universe.

The franchise, which started in 2011 with Ajay Devgn's ""Singham"" series, was announced last year with the release of ""Simmba"", starring Ranveer Singh. The climax of the 2019 film teased Akshay as Sooryavanshi.

The actor said the film's story doesn't view the world through the lens of religion.

""I don't believe in any religion. I only believe in being Indian and that is what the film also shows. The idea of being an Indian and not about being a Parsi or a Hindu or or a Muslim, we haven't looked at it on the basis of the religion,"" Akshay told PTI in an interview here.

When asked if the film is more relevant in current times of communal unrest in the country, the actor said, ""It is a coincidence, we haven't made it deliberately (now). But, yes, it is very much a relevant film today.""

The 52-year-old actor plays Veer Sooryavanshi, an ATS officer, entrusted with the responsibility to protect Mumbai from terror attacks.

As an artiste one is expected to be responsible towards the society, but Akshay said his job is to play the character, good or bad, with sincerity.

""We make films which have negative and positive roles, I am just playing a character. In every film there will be both good and bad characters, the audience is smart enough to understand what to take back from the film - the good or the bad.""

""Sooryavanshi"" marks Akshay and Rohit's first project together and the actor said he had great time working on this film.

""It was very easy to work with Rohit. I have known him for 28 years when he was an assistant and today he is the most notable director. We both love doing action and comedy, so it was fun. We finished the film in 55 to 60 days.""

Akshay, one of the biggest action stars of Bollywood, believes it is important for an actor to be a bit scared while performing action sequences.

Noted action-director Sunil Rodrigues has choreographed the high-octane stunts in ""Sooryavanshi"", which also has extended cameos by Ajay and Ranveer.

""When you do stunts, you need to trust your fight master or director and also should have a belief in yourself. There are people who say one shouldn't have any kind of fear but I believe there should be fear.

""There is good and bad fear, good fear means you check all the types of equipment properly before doing a stunt, which I do. Because of a small mistake, the stunt can go wrong and someone can lose their life. We had taken a lot of precautions for it.""

183,08-3-20,My biggest regret is giving up dancing: Tom Holland,"""Spider-Man"" star Tom Holland says he regrets quitting dance classes, which he joined during his stint on ""Billy Elliot the Musical"" in 2008.

184,08-3-20,It's not like the world changed post #MeToo: Kiara Advani,"Actor Kiara Advani says people today are finally having ""uncomfortable conversations"" about abuse and consent, but it's a stretch to assume that the world post the #MeToo movement has changed.

The #MeToo movement, which began in Hollywood, gained momentum in India in 2018, with women calling out comedians, journalists, authors, actors and filmmakers.

Kiara features in the latest Netflix Original film, ""Guilty"", which explores the different versions of truth that emerge when a small-town girl accuses the college heartthrob of rape.

In the post #MeToo world, the gaze has changed, but Kiara said the change isn't significant.

""It's not like #MeToo happened and the world changed. We don't live in a post #MeToo world. We live in the #MeToo world. We are not there yet,"" Kiara told PTI.

The actor, however, feels people who didn't question anything ""uncomfortable"" until now, have started to talk.

""Now it's shaking. We have always suppressed it. But now we are finally having these uncomfortable conversations. It's high time we did. Everything has to start with a conversation.""

""Guilty"" is produced by Karan Johar's Dharmatic, the digital content arm of the filmmaker's Dharma Production and helmed by Ruchi Narain.

The ""Kabir Singh"" actor says when she was narrated the script, its story enveloped her, making her constantly think of the film.

""The topic is not just relevant but is something that bothers each one of us in a very different way. To be a part of a story that somewhere gave me a character to even voice out a lot of my own thoughts about it, opinions, complications, confusions and all that about a subject as sensitive as this.

""Without being preachy, still telling so much. That for me was really liberating and the story itself, the way Ruchi has written it, the entire narrative, it really holds. It's an immersive experience.""

""Guilty"" happened to her when Kiara had signed big films, including Dharma's ""Good Newwz"" and ""Shershah"", but she never felt that doing a movie for the web would be any less than a theatrical high.

""I believe content comes in every form. If there is a film that I want to watch and I can see myself adding to it in some way, I want to be a part of it. With 'Guilty', it was Dharma doing their first feature film collaboration with Netflix, I had to be a part of it... Today, you have to be relevant. This is the next big step. Lines are blurred today,"" she adds.

""Guilty"" also stars Akansha Ranjan Kapoor, Gurfateh Singh Pirzada and Taher Shabbir among others.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/it-s-not-like-the-world-changed-post--metoo--kiara-advani-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/it-s-not-like-the-world-changed-post--metoo--kiara-advani.html

187,08-3-20,Gulf shares slump after OPEC disagrees on virus response,"Shares in the energy-dependent Gulf plunged to multi-year lows on Sunday after OPEC and its allies failed to clinch a deal on production cuts to support prices that have been hit by the novel coronavirus.

The Saudi stock market, the largest in the region, dived by 7.7 per cent minutes from the opening bell after oil prices closed near a four-year low on Friday.

Shares in oil giant Saudi Aramco dropped below their IPO price of 32 riyals (USD 8.5) for the first time, losing some 6.0 per cent to 31.98 riyals.

The world's biggest company launched on the bourse to much fanfare in December in a record-breaking initial public offering, but since then, its value has slipped from USD 1.71 trillion to USD 1.65 trillion.

The slide on the Saudi market also came amid accounts of high level arrests among the ruling family.

Multiple sources told AFP that Saudi authorities have detained three princes, including King Salman's brother and nephew, for allegedly plotting a coup, in a move that signals Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tightening grip on power.

All other Gulf markets also tumbled. The Dubai Financial Market shed 8.5 per cent at one point, its worst decline in six years, before recovering slightly. Its sister market in Abu Dhabi also lost 7.0 per cent, while the Qatar Stock Exchange dropped 3.5 per cent.

Authorities at Kuwait Boursa intervened twice to suspend trading temporarily after the Premier Market Index slid by more than 7.0 per cent. The tiny markets of Bahrain and Oman dropped by 3.0 percent and 1.1 per cent, respectively.

OPEC and its allies failed to reach a deal on oil production cuts Friday, after Moscow refused to tighten supply to counter the effects of the novel coronavirus outbreak, sending oil prices tumbling.

Brent closed at USD 45.27 a barrel, the lowest in nearly four years.

The failure of the output cuts deal also raised doubts about the future of the entente between OPEC and its allies, which has strongly supported oil prices since 2017.

That gave rise to fears that the new development could trigger tensions between oil producers that will exert massive pressure on prices.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gulf-shares-slump-after-opec-disagrees-on-virus-response-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/gulf-shares-slump-after-opec-disagrees-on-virus-response.html

Elon made a controversial tweet recently regarding the coronavirus scare. According to him, the panic over coronavirus is 'dumb'.

Responding to Musk, the mathematician tweeted, ""Saying the coronavirus panic as dumb is what's dumb.""

Taleb is the author of the Incerto, a five volume philosophical essay on uncertainty published between 2001 and 2018 of which the most known books are The Black Swan and Antifragile.

Meanwhile, there was a range of comments with people reacting to Musk's tweet.

A user wrote: ""I'm totally amazed that somebody who owns a company where employees can't work from home would call taking steps to protect workplaces from a highly-infectious disease dumb.""

Another said: ""Elon should take his wife to Italy this weekend and go walking around the cities.""

190,08-3-20,Pope limits public blessings to help against virus spread,"Pope Francis is further limiting his public appearances to prevent crowds from gathering as a precaution against the spread of coronavirus, which by Saturday had reached the tiny Mediterranean island nation of Malta.

The coronavirus outbreak is tightening its grip on day-to-life life across Europe, particularly in Italy, which is the country with the most cases outside of Asia.

Italy on Saturday recorded its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases since the outbreak broke out in the north of the country on Feb. 21. Another 1,247 cases were reported taking the total to 5,883. Another 36 people also died as a result of the virus, taking the death toll to 233. Most of the deaths have been among the elderly, with one or more underlying condition.

The head of Italy's national health institute, Silvio Brusoferro, urged Italians to take precautions, including avoiding public places and maintaining a distance, to protect the elderly.

He said there was ‘’evidence of superficial attitudes'' toward the measures. The elderly were urged to stay at home if possible, and to avoid emergency rooms, contacting their doctors directly in case of illness.

Italian police requested a stop to gatherings in St. Peter’s Square. In compliance, the Vatican said Francis will deliver his next two public blessings via video, rather than in person.

Both the pope’s traditional Sunday noon blessing and the Wednesday audience will be streamed from the library in the Apostolic Palace. The measures come after the Vatican confirmed its first case of the virus on Friday.

Francis, who is recovering from a cold, has restricted his normally packed public schedule, and also stopped celebrating morning Mass before invited guests at the chapel in the Vatican hotel where he lives.

At 83, and with part of one lung removed from a respiratory infection when he was a young man, Francis is potentially at risk of serious complications if he were to catch the virus. Italy has recommended that elderly people remain at home.

Italy has also asked people to maintain a one-meter (three-foot) distance from strangers in public and to refrain from unnecessary travel. For an economy on the verge of recession, the hit on the tourism industry is a particular blow. Bookings, particularly from abroad, have fallen precipitously across the country, with occupancy rates down to 1% to 2% in Venice.

Health Minister Roberto Speranza urged Italians to follow the norms, no matter how difficult or inconvenient.

‘’Beyond the work of the state and the regions, we need the personal contribution of each citizen,'' Speranza told Sky TG24. ‘’It won’t be norms that win this challenge. We need everyone’s contributions.''

The one-meter measure was having some impact.

In an open-air market in free-wheeling Rome, stand owners posted notices advising clients to keep their distance — and people appeared to be observing the government's recommendation. In Milan, security guards checking tickets at the main train station stood too far back to see, and instead waived passengers through to the tracks rather than come nearer inspect tickets.

But compliance was not universal.

Despite the pleas, life appeared to go on as normal in the northern city of Padua, where restaurants, bars and outdoor markets were full of people enjoying a sunny day. And elsewhere in Rome, butchers, bakeries and pizzerias were packed.

Italy has adopted a piecemeal approach to protective measures, balancing the imperative to reduce contact with the necessity of continuing economic activity. The government shut down schools through March 15 nationwide and advocated remote working, but reopened museums, which had been closed in the north, with the one-meter rule being enforced. Cinemas and theaters in the north remain closed.

Italy has so far borne the brunt of the outbreak in Europe — particularly the north — but the cases elsewhere are mounting.

In Spain, where eight people have died, authorities believe that an important outbreak in the northern part of the country are linked to a funeral were many people became infected.

In Britain, where a second person died Friday of the virus, the public was told to prepare itself for ‘’social distancing,'' which could include temporarily reducing socializing at entertainment or sporting events or reducing non-essential travel on public transport and recommendations to work from home.

Malta’s health officials on Saturday confirmed the country's first cases, a 12-year-old girl of Italian origin and her parents, all living in Malta, who are believed to have contracted the virus after visiting northern Italy recently. The family, which includes another daughter, had self-quarantined upon their return to Malta and all were transferred to an isolated section of Malta’s main public hospital. Malta heath authorities said they are the only three who so far tested positive among 181 people who traveled abroad and exhibited symptoms.

Maltese authorities also announced that MSC Cruises had agreed that the MSC Opera would not enter its port due to coronavirus fears generated by ‘’misleading information given by a local media outlet through a story riddled with partial truths and erroneous details.’’

Concern arose following reports that an Austrian passenger who had disembarked from the MSC Opera after another cruise on Feb. 28 in Genoa, Italy had tested positive for the virus several days after returning home, according to MSC.

Both Malta authorities and MSC said none of the ships current manifest of 1,579 passengers and 723 crew are infected with the coronavirus but that the decision was taken mutually to avoid the risk stirring public protests in Malta. The MSC Opera continued to Messina, Sicily, where passengers were allowed to disembark after officials reviewed medical records.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pope-limits-public-blessings-to-help-against-virus-spread-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pope-limits-public-blessings-to-help-against-virus-spread.html
191,08-3-20,Quarter of Italians on lockdown as virus sweeps globe,"A quarter of the Italian population was locked down on Sunday as the government takes drastic steps to stop the spread of the deadly new coronavirus that is sweeping the globe, with Latin America recording its first fatality.

Italy has seen the most deaths from the COVID-19 disease of any country outside China, where the outbreak that has now killed more than 3,500 people and infected over 100,000 worldwide began in December.

The measures in place until April 3 bar people from entering or leaving vast areas of northern Italy without good reason, according to a decree signed by the prime minister and published online.

The quarantine zones are home to more than 15 million people and include the regions around Venice and financial capital Milan, while cinemas, theatres and museums will be closed nationwide.

It comes as Argentina on Saturday became the first Latin American country to report a fatality from the virus that has affected 95 nations and territories.

Anxious passengers aboard a virus-hit US cruise ship were confined to their cabins in waters off San Francisco, after 21 people tested positive for the disease.

The contagion has already spread to 30 US states, killing at least 19 people, with New York announcing a state of emergency.

The Grand Princess ship was given permission late Saturday to dock in Oakland.

Vice President Mike Pence, who is in charge of the US response to the outbreak, said earlier that all 3,533 passengers and crew would be tested for coronavirus and quarantined if necessary.

Meanwhile another cruise ship, the Costa Fortuna, was turned away by Malaysia and Thailand due to virus fears, an official said Sunday. The boat is carrying around 2,000 people, including dozens of Italians.

The World Health Organization described worldwide virus cases passing the 100,000-mark as a ""sombre moment"".

The WHO said the efforts of China and other countries were ""demonstrating that spread of the virus can be slowed"" with the path of the disease even ""reversed through the implementation of robust containment and control activities"".

As recorded deaths in Italy soared to 233 on Saturday, the Vatican announced Pope Francis's Angelus prayer -- normally delivered by the 83-year-old pontiff from his window -- would be broadcast as a livestream.

Italy has the world's second-oldest population after Japan, according to the World Bank, and elderly people appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill from the virus.

Retired doctors are being recruited to bolster the Italian healthcare system, while civil protection officials say Lombardy region is having trouble finding beds in hospitals.

Colombia, Costa Rica, Malta, the Maldives, Bulgaria and Paraguay have also announced their first cases.

The number of infections in South Korea passed 7,000 on Saturday -- the highest in the world outside China.

Iran's 21 new deaths from the epidemic and 1,076 fresh cases reported Saturday brought the overall tolls there to 145 dead and 5,823 infected.

The virus has hit international business, tourism, and sports events, with almost 300 million students sent home worldwide as schools and universities close.

The Scotland-France women's rugby match scheduled for Saturday in Glasgow was postponed after a Scottish player tested positive for the coronavirus, Scottish Rugby said.

Organisers of the Barcelona marathon on Saturday postponed the event, which had been scheduled for March 15, until October 25.

And in Canada, the International Ice Hockey Federation called off the Women's World Ice Hockey Championships, which had been set to run from March 31 to April 10.

193,08-3-20,"Sena left BJP, not Hindutva, says Uddhav","Maha CM gives Rs 1 cr for Mandir from his own trust

Visiting Ayodhya to mark his Government’s completion of 100 days in office on Saturday, Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said his party’s former ally BJP is not synonymous with “Hindutva” and the Shiv Sena parted ways with the BJP and not Hindutva.

Accompanied by his wife Rashmi Thackeray and son Aditya Thackeray, the CM also announced a donation of Rs 1 crore for the upcoming Ram temple.

“Main BJP se alag hua hun, Hindutva se nahi. BJP ka matlab Hindutva nahi hai. Hindutva alag hai, BJP alag hai,” said the Sena chief on ending 35-year-old alliance with the BJP.

“Shiv Sena has its belief deeply rooted in Hindutva and should be seen separately from the BJP. It’s the BJP that has drifted away from Hindutva. I (Shiv Sena) am separate from the BJP, not from Hindutva,” said Uddhav.

The Maharashtra CM said, “I have come to know that the bank account of the Temple Trust has become operational in Ayodhya only yesterday. I want to humbly say that I am donating Rs 1 crore for the formation of Ram temple from my trust and not the Government exchequer.”

“I spoke to UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Friday. A grand Ram temple will definitely be built and we all will build it. I want to request Yogi to give us a piece of land to construct Maharashtra Bhavan to facilitate Ram Bhakts coming from Maharashtra,” he said.

Mentioning that this was his third visit to Ayodhya in the last 18 months, Uddhav recalled that Shiv Sena had asked the Government to pass a law to construct Ram temple which did not happen.

He cherished the fact that both the Ayodhya judgment and his taking over as CM of Maharashtra happened in November 2019, exactly a year after he visited Ayodhya.

The Maharashtra CM said, “I have once again come for a darshan of Ram Lalla with my saffron family. I will keep coming again and perform aarti on Sarayu river banks.” Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had announced in January that Uddhav would visit Ayodhya to seek blessings of Lord Ram. Raut had also requested leaders of Maha alliance to visit Ayodhya with Shiv Sena.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sena-left-bjp--not-hindutva--says-uddhav-2020-03-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/sena-left-bjp--not-hindutva--says-uddhav.html
