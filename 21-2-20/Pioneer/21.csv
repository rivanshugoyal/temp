0,21-2-20,Tesla’s second coming,"The company announces it is working on improved EV batteries to reduce ‘range anxiety’ among drivers

South Africa-born entrepreneur Elon Musk is a polarising figure. His late night tweets are analysed by venture capitalists and tech journalists as much as that of US President Donald Trump’s morning tweets, which are examined by diplomats and political journalists alike. It would not thus be incorrect to argue that Musk has become one of the most important human beings in the world alongside Trump. That’s because his automotive venture, Tesla Motors, which makes Electric Vehicles (EVs), is now valued at $100 billion, more than the entirety of India’s automotive sector combined and even more than that of Volkswagen AG, the German automotive colossus. Only Japanese carmaker Toyota is worth more by quite a bit. But Tesla Motors, named after the famed Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla, who promoted the alternating current system, is now miles ahead of the rest of the global automotive industry as it pivots towards an electric future. It is not only taking a lead with its readily available products but dominates the software world, too, with its autonomous driving system.

Musk and Tesla are also leading the charge when it comes to battery technology. The company is now developing batteries that can ensure an electric car can travel almost 600 km on a single charge. It will make for the longest journeys possible on a single charge, diluting “range anxiety” that is still the single-most quoted reason for people not to buy electric vehicles at this time. Yet, while Tesla solves problems for the first world, India is still miles away from adopting an electric future, with infrastructure and manufacturing far behind the curve. That said, the few electric cars that have been launched in our country right now are promising and have decent enough range for daily commuting, if not long-distance travel. With Musk bemoaning high Customs duties for imported cars, Tesla Motors is yet to come to India. It would be wise for the Government to keep a lower degree at least initially on electric cars to promote their usage going forward.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tesla---s-second-coming-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/tesla---s-second-coming.html
1,21-2-20,No country for women,"Govt apathy and hopelessness have led many farm widows to take their lives. Just how many more suicides will it take for the State to take action?

Mudapu Yadamma, 38, is from Mallareddipalli village in Nalgonda district, Telangana. Two years ago, her husband, a farmer, committed suicide by consuming pesticide and left her with a debt of Rs 3.5 lakh. Kamatham Lakshmidevi, 31, is from Danduvaripalli village in Ananthapur district of Andhra Pradesh. She, too, was left with a debt of Rs 8 lakh after her husband, also a farmer, killed himself two years ago.

Vidya More, 38, is from Maharashtra. When her husband ended his life in 2012, his suicide was declared not eligible (as a farm suicide) thereby denying her the right to ex-gratia compensation.

They may live in different States but the fate of farm widows across the country is worryingly similar. Not only do farm widows suddenly become invisible to the State, they are ostracised by their families and are left to fend for themselves, especially when they are hounded to repay the debts taken by their farmer husbands. Latest statistics released by the Government show that 11,379 farmers killed themselves in India in 2016. In other words, there were 948 suicides every month or 31 growers committed suicide daily. One big reason for this was mounting debts. While the inability to pay back loans can be attributed to several reasons, including failed crops, the agrarian crisis and the unavailability of alternative opportunities for earning a livelihood, the burden of repaying the debts has fallen on their widows.

At present, there is no programme or policy that frees these farm widows from debts incurred by their husbands. The harrying by banks or moneylenders begins almost immediately after the husband’s death, leaving hardly any time for the widow to mourn her spouse.

The need to survive and look after her children pushes her to earn a living. But studies have shown that the woman farmer often adopts the same kind of farming as the deceased husband. She also resorts to the same practice of chemical-intensive and external-input-driven farming requiring investments and borrowing. But with women farmers not seen as credit-worthy and access to Government schemes and credit being limited, the situation can be so hopeless and dire that women farmers are often forced to take the same path as their husbands and end their lives. Women accounted for 8.6 per cent of farmer suicides in the country.

A prime cause has been the inadequate efforts by the Government to prevent farmer suicides coupled with insufficient and lopsided support to families affected by them, according to the Mahila Kisan Adhikaar Manch (MAKAAM), an informal forum comprising 120 organisations of women farmers and civil society groups in 24 States working to secure rights of women growers.

Recent consultations on the “Status of Women Farmers in Farm Suicide Families” held by MAKAAM and UN Women also revealed that the lack of recognition by the Government of the deaths as farm suicides in many cases further exacerbated the conditions of the marginalised widows as the State refused to extend any support to them.

Korra Shanthi is one such victim of State apathy. A resident of Nalgonda district, Telangana, Shanthi and her husband were engaged in cultivation on leased land. When her husband ended his life in 2018, Shanthi was left with a debt of Rs 6 lakh. Although she applied for ex-gratia payment with the help of local activists, she has not received any money yet. Shanthi has been told that she is unlikely to receive it because her husband did not own any land in his name, making her ineligible for ex-gratia payment.

Since several State Government rules specify that only land owners and land title holders are considered as farmers while extending support to the suicide-affected family, those toiling on leased land fall through the cracks. With land ownership being the main criteria, tenant farmers and women farmers, especially farm widows who do not have land in their names, are not recognised as real farmers. Further, farmers who have borrowed from moneylenders also don’t get counted as eligible or genuine cases and their widows and families are denied compensation. “This is one of the biggest problems in Punjab,” contends 40-year-old Veerpal Kaur. A resident of Mansa district, Punjab, Kaur has witnessed the despair that led to her husband, father and father-in-law ending their lives. But their families were not considered eligible although the suicides were due to farm distress.

Lack of recognition is a major hurdle in the relief and rehabilitation of widows and their families. This is according to a MAKAAM study on the status of women in farm suicide-affected families in six States of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Punjab. One of the important findings was that in Maharashtra, Punjab and Karnataka, only those farmers who had institutional debt were considered as genuine and eligible for support, not those who ended their lives due to pressure from moneylenders.

Moreover, there was a wide variation in the relief and rehabilitation package given by these six States. The study showed that the criteria used to determine “farm suicides” were different across States and even within the relevant agencies like the police, agriculture and revenue departments.

According to MAKAAM’s Seema Kulkarni, even in the States where compensation was being paid, it was not uniform. “While Andhra Pradesh provides a compensation of Rs 7 lakh for each family, in Maharashtra, which has the largest number of farm suicides in the country, this is only Rs 2 lakh. In the case of Telangana, although its policy states a compensation of Rs 6 lakh, hardly any payment had been made since subsuming farm suicide cases into the Farmer Insurance scheme called Rythu Beema Padhakam”, says Kulkarni.

Of all the States, only Andhra Pradesh had a one-time settlement mechanism, (used in certain cases), to settle all outstanding institutional as well as private loans within Rs 1 lakh to liberate woman from never-ending debt. However, its use was limited.

The study also found that only Karnataka had a policy to support education of children from farm suicide families, including reimbursement of fee of those studying in private institutions. “However, even here, the implementation was poor and lacked coordination between different agencies, states”, Ashalatha Satyam of Rythu Swarajya Vedika, a MAKAAM partner.

She points out that such a policy does not exist in other States. This is why many widows in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh had to pull out their children from schools. Although the Maharashtra Government had announced a support package related to education fee, nothing has been finalised so far.

In cases where land is in the name of the husband, wives have the opportunity to eke out a living once they are able to get it transferred in their name. But even here it is usually a long and uphill battle as relatives don’t want to give her the rightful share in the property. Lack of land ownership has forced most of the women to either become labourers or seek other means of employment, often at the cost of their safety. So, Mudapu Yadamma is dependent on wage labour to keep her three children in school since her in-laws are not prepared to give her a share in the family land. Kamatham Laxmidevi, too, was denied her share in the family land cultivated by her husband and does any work that helps her earn a living. Vidya More has taken up sewing and wage labour to make ends meet. But all this isn’t enough to repay the huge debts incurred by their husbands.

They are not the only ones struggling for survival and their rights. Hundreds of farm widows have fallen off the Government’s radar. Government apathy and hopelessness have led many to take their lives. This is not unknown to the political masters. Then what is the Government waiting for? Just how many more suicides will it take for it to take action?

2,21-2-20,We must come up Trumps,"Leaders of both nations have to look at meaningful and time-bound solutions to address each other's concerns on emerging trade issues

In the run up to President Donald Trump’s maiden visit to India, a bunch of eye-catching, US Secret Service men have started fanning out in locations which the leader is expected to visit. Make no mistake, that’s not the only spectacle India will witness for the next week or so. “Namaste Trump” formerly “Kemcho Trump”, promises to be a grander display of abundance and strategic friendship than “Howdy Modi” in Houston. Trump has already made statements on being “Number one” on Facebook, ahead of Modi, and expressed elation over the millions and millions of people who are expected to greet him in India.

Meanwhile, thousands of eyes would be scanning for inches or miles moved in the crucial Indo-US strategic partnership corridor. Trump is keen for India to open up its markets further for US goods and services and act as a key balancing partner in the region that is facing threats of dominance from China. Pushing his “America first” policy, Trump has been chipping away at any preferential treatment to India, specially in the field of trade. A few days ago, he declared India with a national average income of $2,000 and, therefore, an approximate $3 trillion economy as “developed” at par with China. He thereby justified taking India off any list of a preferential trade policy. Perhaps in the same breath a US-based think tank World Population Review has ranked India as the fifth-largest economy, overtaking the UK and France. While it may have led to celebrations in some quarters, many look at this development under the bleak prospect of a meaningful trade deal.

India’s key ask from the US at this stage is a reinstatement of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSPs) programme which will allow it to export nearly $6 billion worth of goods to the US under nearly zero tariffs. While it may be less than 10 per cent of India’s overall exports to the US, it is a sticking point. Several trade watchers and policy analysts have indicated that the US is pushing for an increase of nearly $5-$6 billion in additional trade value of goods. Hopeful of a deal, nearly $3.5 billion defence agreements between India and the US are ready to be signed when Trump visits India. These include nearly 30 armed helicopters mostly meant for naval operations, a key tool in the strategic Indian Ocean where China has been seen flexing its maritime muscles. Whether a sale of weapons and military copters will be seen within the broad contours of Indo-US trade, will be a complex question to answer.

That leaves — fraught with screaming lobbies on both sides — high attention agricultural produce and medical equipment sectors. In the run-up to the visit, reports have surfaced of India’s willingness to allow low tariff import of some frozen meat products, along with berries and nuts. Conditional import of dairy products with strict compliance to the vegetarian nature of the produce, could also be made. Limited concessions on medical devices’ price caps imposed in the post-GSP era, can also be brought to the table.

However, right now chances of a restricted or “mini” trade deal are also looking like a distant possibility. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who was supposed to be in India at least a week before Trump to given final contours to the deal, has given it a pass, substituting it with hectic video conference calls with his Indian counterpart Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. It is unclear if the duo would be able to strike a lighting deal in under a week to come up with crackling billion figure hopes.

Many point at previous last-minute dashes for making major announcements, sometimes literally minutes ahead of crucial leadership meetings. Take the example of US support to India’ permanent seat at the UN Security Council, a decision which was taken “15 minutes” ahead of then President Barack Obama’s address to the Indian Parliament. This gives rise to hopes of a fig leaf trade deal pending since the “Howdy Modi” event in Houston last year being accomplished during the “Namaste Trump” extravaganza.

This deal or no deal, from what we gather, still leaves an impactful chunk of digital trade between India and the US. Trade in services between the two nations — large portions of it digitally-aided — remains a key area of negotiation. US companies have raised concerns with Indian counterparts and the Government on the restrictive nature of tariffs and non-tariff barriers which limit the access of US tech firms to India. For instance, the upcoming Data Protection Bill has text additions which suggest compulsory data localisation and sharing of non-personal data with the Government. These are seen as growth and innovation barriers in a connected, seamless, shared digital economy of two great democracies.Technology collaboration by removing tariff and non-tariff barriers, specifically in the technology segment, could be great lever of strategic and public policy partnership for both countries. One clear area to work together is looking at developing protocols beyond fifth generation or 5G followed by communications. India and the US can be natural partners in the new digital trade world. Rhetoric and spectacle aside, leaders of both nations have to look at meaningful and time-bound solutions to address each other’s concerns on emerging trade issues while ensuring prosperity for local markets.

3,21-2-20,Your next car will not be electric,"Electric cars have come a long way in India but they still cost far too much for a majority of Indians. For now

First things first. We have to keep in mind that we live in a country where the people who are in power believe that cars are a luxury item. That was made clear by Prime Minister Narendra Modi the other day when he said that 1.5 crore luxury cars have been sold in India over the past five years. Now, while I believe WagonR and Santro are fairly nice cars, BMW is not, because as much as the i3 tries to be basic, it really isn’t.

Luxury or premium cars in my book are cars that cost upwards of Rs 30 lakh, which would include the higher-end of mass-market brands. That means cars like the Hyundai Santa Fe and, of course, all the German premium brands as well as Lexus, Volvo and the like. The figure for sales of such cars would at best be around 250,000 over the past five years. Because the total sale of cars in India is 1.5 crore. So now we know, according to the government cars are a symbol of bourgeoise, the moment you move to four wheels, whether it is a Maruti Alto or an Audi, you are a member of the entitled classes. Not for politicians and bureaucrats, of course, because they need cars to tell us how bad we are for not paying taxes.

Anyway, back to the topic. Which again involves excise duties, Customs and taxes again. The fact is that electric cars are far too expensive for mass adoption in a country like India. The two electric SUVs that have been launched so far, the Hyundai Kona and the MG ZS EV, are both cars that can definitely be lived with on a daily basis without any worry about range. If you live in a city like Delhi where you have parking, and if you can afford a Rs 25 lakh car you possibly do have parking, charging is not a problem. With ranges of 300 kilometres, and the average daily commute being 25-30 kilometres, you will easily survive a week on a single charge. As for long-distance driving, well, Delhi-Lucknow may be a bit of a stretch but Agra, Chandigarh, Dehradun and Jaipur should be easily achievable as long as you have planned for a charging point at your destination. There are few, if any, public chargers outside Delhi and even those in Delhi are often not compatible with all cars as I have discovered in the past. But one assumes that will change going forward.

But until it changes and until cars like the Kona and ZE EV will make no sense whatsoever. Cars with more limited ranges such as the Tata Nexon EV and the Mahindra e-Verito are entering governmental and taxi fleets in Delhi, the latter being a bit bizarre given the usage of taxis over long distances and without any fast-charging infrastructure. That is because decent range costs money and battery costs make up the bulk of the cost of an electric car. Without any battery manufacturing in India, all batteries are imported from China and as the last couple of weeks have shown, our neighbour is integral to the global supply chain. As China gets the flu, even India’s automotive industry will sneeze. That is just for some small components. Can you imagine what will happen if unrestricted imports of batteries are allowed from China? Indian manufacturing and jobs will be hollowed out. India needs to secure lithium resources and establish battery factories and work towards reducing costs of electric cars.

There is little doubt that electric vehicles are the future of mobility across the world but we should not make the assumption that the world is equal. In the United States, a $50,000 car is a standard family car and the Tesla Model 3 serves that purpose but the optics of a Rs 35 lakh car in India, possibly Rs 70 lakh after Customs duties particularly with politicians railing against the rich, won’t work, right? India has to take smaller, more sustainable steps towards electrification. Even for public transport, forcing electrification down the throats of transport bodies when they do not have enough buses to transport the people they need to now, is counter-productive. There is far too much misinformation about the benefits of electrification of vehicles out there. The plain and simple fact is that electric vehicles are expensive, and it does not make sense for India at the current time and the current economic environment to move to electric cars and buses. Hybrids, where smaller engines are coupled with small batteries, make much more sense in the next decade in India. And in that time we should work towards improving affordability and growing our economy so as to afford electric cars and make them in India.

In the rush towards electric vehicles, we should really not lose sight of the bigger picture.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/your-next-car-will-not-be-electric-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/your-next-car-will-not-be-electric.html
4,21-2-20,Strive to preserve your identity,"Maintaining and retaining the languages of ethnic and cultural groups is critical for the preservation of cultural heritage and identity. Using one’s mother tongue at home is part of this exercise

To promote awareness of linguistic and cultural diversity and bolster social and multilingual identity, the International Mother Tongue Day is celebrated every year on this day (February 21).

Mother tongue refers to a person’s native language, that is, a language learned from birth. The first International Mother Tongue Day was observed in 1990 after the declaration by the United Nations (UN) to recognise the sacrifices of people who lost their lives for the sake of their mother tongue in Bangladesh.

Language is one of the most precious gifts that we have and each tongue represents a unique and distinct cultural heritage. Language is a means of communicating values, beliefs and customs and has an important social function as it fosters feelings of group identity and solidarity. It is the means by which culture, traditions and shared values may be conveyed and preserved.

About 50 per cent of the world’s out-of-school children live in communities where the medium of instruction is different from the language used at home. This is perhaps one of the most astounding facts about second language education. Schools have tried to tackle the problem by going to the families of these children for assistance in helping students gain confidence in the use of the second language. They ask the parents to use the second language at home so that the students become more comfortable with it and are able to cope with it in school. This does more harm than good for reasons other than that of a second language being much harder to learn regardless of copious levels of effort put in to achieve fluency.

In developing areas, usually there aren’t resources enough to prepare students at this level, so the efforts made by the parents and the students are futile in that sense.

This second language education also causes a rift between families and their native languages in a wholly unnecessary way. Families feel alienated from their mother tongue simply because the school gives the impression that they should feel this way. By propagating this attitude, these education systems are essentially destroying diverse cultures and backgrounds that make our species so great.

The different languages and dialects spoken throughout the globe reflect how history and culture have shaped the way in which people speak, think and reflect. Our mother tongue helps to link new generations to the past, which is part of our cultural and plurilingual heritage. It is a well-known fact that everyone had a language that they grew up speaking and a good proportion of the world spoke more than one tongue. However, the idea that someone would regularly have to be taught in a language that wasn’t native to them had never occurred previously. “This was, undoubtedly, exacerbated by the fact that I never made significant strides towards becoming fluent in another language. The closest I had ever come was a working proficiency in Spanish during my junior year of high school. When I think back on my perspective on this subject in the context of my parents, their accents never bothered me because I had just always been so used to them”, says a 21-year-old former student Tej, who is pursuing higher studies at Washington University in St Louis, USA.

Leanne Hinton, a Professor of linguistics at the University of California in Berkeley, says in Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education, “More broadly, the loss of language is part of the loss of whole cultures and knowledge systems, including philosophical systems, oral literary and musical traditions, environmental knowledge systems, medical knowledge and important cultural practices and artistic skills. The world stands to lose an important part of the sum of human knowledge whenever a language stops being used. Just as the human species is putting itself in danger through the destruction of species diversity, so might we be in danger from the destruction of the diversity of knowledge systems”.

These problems are hard to fix. If one were to approach educators and tell them to fix the issue, they would undoubtedly point to a lack of resources. Nevertheless, an effort must be made by educators to have respect for the mother tongue of their students, even if it is different from their own.

The beauty of academic education is that the majority of it comes from books that can be more easily produced in areas with greater resources. It is for the educators in these parts of the world — who are multilingual — to produce orthographical and instructional materials for use in developing areas. Given the resource crisis in the developing world, this is likely to be one of the most practical solutions. Children in developing areas have the thirst for knowledge, we must do what we can to satiate it.

Language is the essence and identity of culture and is a major tool of communication and for exchange of ideas and emotions. To know your language is the simplest and most important way to keep and preserve your culture. In recent times, the idea of linguistic and cultural awareness has increased; thus allowing the mother tongue to be more culturally accepted.

It is clear, that we must strive to reform the systems that educate the youth, in order to further the quality of learning in the first language or mother tongue and to inspire solidarity based on understanding, tolerance and dialogue.

Maintaining and retaining the languages of ethnic and cultural groups is critical for the preservation of cultural heritage and identity. Using one’s mother tongue at home will make it easier for speakers to be more comfortable with their own linguistic and cultural identity.

“As we have given ample time to people to avail benefits of the amnesty scheme, there will be no further extension of deadline. Now, the next step would be to initiate action against those who have deviated from rules,” Jena told reporters outside the Assembly.

Earlier on the day, Congress Legislature Party Leader Narasingh Mishra had raised the issue in the floor of the House and demanded a further extension of the deadline in view of an overwhelming response to the scheme.

Following this, Speaker Surjya Narayan Patro in a ruling directed the Housing and Urban Development to look into the matter.

Notably, the Government had launched the scheme in June 2018 asking the people concerned to regularise their unauthorised constructions by paying a definite fee apart from submission of building construction plans and fire safety certificates. In June 2019, the deadline of the scheme was extended for six months. Thereafter, there were two more extensions, the last one having February 20 this year as the deadline.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---no-more-amnesty-deadline-extension---.html
7,21-2-20,The war on rationality,"Shutting down N-power plants only to replace them with coal burning is the height of illogic. Nobody is as crazy as the Germans and the Japanese

Germany and Japan are finally winning a war together. Unfortunately, it is the “war on rationality.” Coal, as everybody knows, is by far the most damaging source of energy we use, in terms of both the harm to human beings and the impact on the climate. It’s twice as bad as natural gas and dozens of times worse than solar or nuclear or wind power. Yet both Germany and Japan have been building a lot of new coal-fired power stations. But why are they still betting on coal?

Would it upset you if I said it’s because they are, despite their apparent sophistication, superstitious peasants at heart? Well, go ahead and get upset. Germany still gets more than a third of its energy from burning coal and most of it is ultra-polluting lignite or “brown” coal. Solar, wind, geo-thermal and hydropower generation provide just 17 per cent of the country’s electricity needs. If most of Germany’s 17 nuclear powers had not been shut down after 2012 (the last are scheduled to close within two years), then at least half the coal would not have been needed.

There had been an active anti-nuclear power movement in Germany for some time but what triggered the 2012 decision to shut the entire sector down was the Fukushima disaster of the previous year. I am deliberately avoiding the words “calamity”, “disaster” and “catastrophe” because while the Fukushima tsunami killed 19,000 people, the subsequent problem with the four nuclear reactors on the coast killed nobody. Yet, the German people, or at least a large number of German anti-nuclear activists, insisted that any nuclear reactor anywhere was a mortal danger and the Government agreed to shut all nuclear plants down. The country pulled a 180 and decided to embark on ending its use of nuclear power entirely.

The same thing happened in Japan. The Japanese planners were foolish to put four reactors on the coast in a region where earthquakes and consequent tsunamis were to be expected from time to time. What needs to be condemned is the decision of the planners and not nuclear power. Nevertheless, all 50 Japanese nuclear reactors, which accounted for 30 per cent of the country’s electrical power, were immediately shut down.

The Japanese are not as blindly dogmatic as the Germans: Two of those nuclear plants reopened in 2015 and seven more resurfaced recently. A further 17 are in the lengthy process of restart approval. So by 2030, the Japanese Government hopes to be getting 20 per cent of its electricity from nuclear power again. But that’s only half the amount of nuclear power that Japan originally planned to make available by 2030. The gap between 20 per cent and the planned 40 per cent of the country’s energy needs will be made up by burning coal.

Japan recently announced that it plans to build 22 new coal-burning power plants in the next five years. Its Government has argued that these coal plants use ultra-supercritical boilers that are vastly more energy-efficient and pollute less per unit of energy. But these plants still emit greenhouse gases and are a non-starter for activists who want the world to zero out carbon emissions.

This is deeply irresponsible behaviour and the worst thing is that the decision-makers know it. They are just deferring to public opinion, which in this instance is entirely wrong. The “superstitious peasants” should really be frightened of global warming, for which coal-burning is a major driver, not of relatively harmless nuclear power.

That’s not to say that nuclear power is the solution to all our problems, or even most of them. It is generally the most expensive option because it costs so much to build the reactors and the associated controls and safety devices. Indeed, nuclear is no longer cost-competitive with other “clean” sources of power like wind and solar.

So there is a case for not building any more nuclear power stations, at least in regions and countries that have ample resources in terms of sun and wind. But there is no case for shutting down existing nuclear stations and burning more coal to make up the difference. That is so stupid, it verges on the criminal.

Other countries can be idiotic, too. Due to an administrative glitch, Chinese provinces are currently building hundreds of unnecessary coal-fired power stations that may never be used, since the Central Government expects the country’s coal use to peak this year — and most existing Chinese coal plants already sit idle more than half of the time.

China is using coal power financing as a key element of its Belt and Road Initiative to expand its economic and political influence throughout Asia and Africa. Both Japan and China are now racing to secure lucrative construction contracts in developing countries to expand their strategic reach.

At least China is also building nuclear plants as fast as it can. Last year, it accounted for more than half the world’s output of solar panels. (On the other hand, it is providing work for the Chinese construction industry by building a planned 300 coal-fired power stations in other countries, presumably on the unspoken assumption that carbon dioxide emissions elsewhere won’t affect China’s climate.)

But nobody is as crazy as the Germans and the Japanese, who have been shutting down nuclear plants and replacing them with coal-fired plants. France will close its last coal-fired station in 2022 and Britain will do the same in 2025. But Germany says 2038 and Japan just says “eventually.” That’s far too late: By then the die will be cast and the world will be committed to more than 2oC of warming.

8,21-2-20,Priyanka for RS?,"The Cong is hoping that the gambit of putting her in a Central role will hold out some hope of reviving the party

There may be a host of recommendations for the Congress to revive itself and capitalise on its pan-India matrix as a cohesive Opposition force. But there’s nobody to accept them. There may be umpteen calls to restore inner-party democracy by holding organisational elections and choosing capable leaders and its president based on cadre choices. But there’s nobody to “bell the cat” as one of its own self-deprecating leaders said. There may be articulate and activist young leaders, who have sought to shine their light for a 2.0 recast but have been fobbed off by old hawks who fear their irrelevance, even if that applies to holding on to the crumbs of a fast disintegrating party. There may be seasoned leaders with wise words of wisdom that run in different directions, justifying them as inner party democratic dialogues although the world sees them as terrible infighting. There’s the old matriarch, who is still keeping it together, the Gandhi tag the party’s brand adhesive that’s as scapegoating for party leaders in failure as grandstanding in success. But Sonia Gandhi doesn’t know how to pass it on to her offspring. Reconciling some issues and the generational divide, infusing fresh breath energy with his band of followers was son Rahul, reluctant yet stubborn, a cocktail that’s more implosive than explosive. Then there is Priyanka Gandhi, the more willing and capable scion with some strike capabilities, who could have been the galvaniser had not her brahmastra potential been wasted by benching her. So the Congress is tempted to play its last family card to mend the party by assigning her a Central role now rather than waiting for the next round of parliamentary elections. As 51 Rajya Sabha seats will be falling vacant in April, of which eight are from the three party-ruled States, there’s a growing clamour to elect her to the Rajya Sabha.

Can this reset the Congress’ narrative indeed? On the face of it, she has not been able to sway the Lok Sabha verdict even though she was made party general-secretary in charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP). In fact, the Gandhis lost the home bastion of Amethi, too. Beyond some crowd-pleasing speeches, dramatic optics with the boatmen of Varanasi and campaign colour, Priyanka was compromised by an organisational matrix that had been floundering in the face of the BJP’s phalanx. She herself admitted as much. And although she is probably the only politician other than Modi who can produce a mass resonance, she has two handicaps — the people’s rejection of the politics of entitlement and a disconnect with the grassroots. Which is why one must credit her with not abandoning UP even after the Lok Sabha debacle while her brother chose exile. She worked the ground unlike her brother, who chose to be a disembodied conscience. She has been taking up the cudgels on behalf of the dispossessed tribals in Sonbhadra, praying with Dalits and has been visiting the anti-citizenship law protesters at the receiving end of police brutality. She has also been articulating her positions on national issues rather vociferously on social media. There is a rooted realism to her brother’s exalted escapism, one that is now translating into huge crowd turnouts at her roadshow to the utter discomfort of caste-based parties, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). Not only has she lived down her tag, her political sensibilities are primed and she has based herself in Lucknow with diligence of purpose. But the real problem is how she negotiates the tricky territory between her and Rahul camp followers and obviates criticism that by getting elected to the Rajya Sabha, the Gandhis would ensure family representation in each House and were just living out their timelines as legislators. But Priyanka could make herself heard that much more nationally as a parliamentarian and counter the BJP’s oratory and propaganda. Comparisons are being drawn about how her grandmother Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister in 1966 as a Rajya Sabha member. However, the context was different as Indira had the Congress as the dominant political party ruling in most States and at the Centre. That position has been wrested by the BJP today, leaving Priyanka with virtually no enablers. She has a classic glass cliff situation; she could emerge in her own right if she manages to bring the Congress out of the ventilator or she could be condemned for inefficiencies if she fails. Besides, she has a better connect with and a sensibility to deal with both senior and junior leaders, who are claiming fiefdoms of importance and fighting each other, be it Milind Deora, Ajay Maken, Pawan Khera, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Kamal Nath or Jyotiraditya Scindia. She could still be the balancer and end the confusion at least. But how would she avoid her Achilles’ heel, businessman-husband Robert Vadra, who is entangled in vigilance probes? If she manages the political dissociation from personal, perhaps she could still get the party back on keel.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/priyanka-for-rs--2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/priyanka-for-rs-.html

10,21-2-20,2 arrested in Banki double murder case,"Five days after the brutal double murder in Banki, the Cuttack (Rural) police on Thursday claimed to have solved the mystery by arresting two persons. Husband of a local Sarpanch and a Congress activist Bhagaban Swain and his associate journalist Aditya Ransingh were murdered by a group of miscreants.

Demanding a Crime Branch enquiry into the incident, the Congress has described the killings on broad daylight as “political murders” and alleged that the ruling BJD is behind the crime. Police, on the other hand, continue to maintain that the murders were an outcome of previous rivalries.

“Investigations made so far have revealed that the deceased persons and the perpetrators of the crime were always at the loggerheads; and there were reports of previous assaults and counter-assaults between them,” said Cuttack (Rural) SP RB Panigrahi, adding that two persons in this connection are already arrested and two others are detained.

Meanwhile, a delegation of Congress leaders on the day met DGP Abhay at the police headquarters here and submitted a memorandum to him demanding a Crime Branch enquiry into the murders.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/2-arrested-in-banki-double-murder-case.html
11,21-2-20,"Muslim women on Delhi road for months, why?","It is more than two months. Hundreds of Muslim women in Delhi are sitting on the road day and night for a cause which has nothing to do with them or any of their fellow Indians. They are protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which gives citizenship to the religiously persecuted minorities of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan and is no way related to any citizen of India. And then, their opposition is to National Population Register (NPR), which is only a collection of data of the population of India required for the Census done at a gap of ten years. And finally, there is National Register of Citizens (NRC), which is yet to be drafted. Nobody knows what provisions would be laid in it. Yet the Muslim women are sitting on the road round the clock and protesting for the unknown NRC, a routine NPR and the harmless CAA. The Muslim women are so concerned that they have been sitting in the open in chilling cold which has already claimed the life of a four-month-old.

There was a lady called Shah Bano Begum, a mother of five children who was divorced by her affluent husband at the age of sixty two and was left in the lurch. She ran from pillar to post for help but did not get any. At last, she moved to the Supreme Court, which came to her rescue and ordered a regular amount of money for her maintenance. But the Mullahs saw the meagre amount of Rs 200 per month as a severe threat to Islam and the ‘protest’ began. The Rajiv Gandhi Government, with more than four hundred members in the Parliament, came to its knees and amended the Constitution to deprive the poor lady of the poor amount of maintenance. The Muslim women of India did not come out of their homes to sit in dharna for the cause of Sah Bano Begum.

Then, there was the eternally hanging sword of Triple Talaq over the heads of Muslim ladies. Any woman, any time and for any or no cause could be inflicted with a verbal divorce by her husband for which she would have no scope to defend herself or challenge the one-sided supremacist verdict of her male partner. Triple pronouncement of a single word ‘Talaq’ would ruin a well-settled woman and turn her life to a hell full of agony. Muslim women were being divorced by a verbal pronunciation of the word ‘Talaq’, by a telephonic message, by an e-mail or Whatsapp message and the so on. They were absolutely under the whims and mercies of their husbands. No woman could know which moment of her life would turn her to a destitute. The Muslim women of India never thought it necessary to come to the street against the heartless practice.

Then, there is the hellish Halala system. A divorced woman is to marry and establish physical relation with another man if she were to marry her earlier husband who had divorced her but has condescended to marry her again. The lady has to undergo a process which humiliates her very existence. She has to marry another man and have physical relation with him in order to qualify for a second marriage with her old husband only if her new husband gives her Talaq. This has never urged the Muslim ladies to sit in a dharna in any part of the country.

Then, the prevailing polygamy practice which allows a husband to have four wives and a wife has to share her husband with three more co-wives under the same roof. This existing system is yet to motivate the Muslim women to come out to demand its discontinuance.

And also the Muttah Nikah or the temporary pleasure marriage (mostly vogue in Kerala) in which aged people like Sheikhs of Arab marry young poor girls during the formers’ holidays in India. At the end of the stipulated time, the girls, mostly pregnant, are left behind entirely to their fates. Muslim women of India never thought of coming out of their homes against this heinous practice.

And the inconvenient attire ‘Burkha’ which has been banned in many countries in the globe but is prevalent in India has never urged the Indian Muslim women to come out to the road and demand liberation from it.

But for these women it was indispensable to come out to the road and sit in dharna by taking Delhi to ransom because, for them, the Constitution is in danger. Among them are grand old women above ninety who perhaps do not know the meaning of “Samvidhan”, they are sitting to protect. And what is their model of ‘protecting the endangered Constitution’? It is by unconstitutionally blocking a road which is causing inconveniences to lakhs of people every day and a huge daily loss to the local business. Their model of ‘protecting the Constitution’ is to curse the Prime Minister and wish a death of ‘Hitler’ to the same Narendra Modi who liberated these ladies from the swords of Triple Talaq hanging over their heads since centuries. Their model of ‘protecting the Constitution’ is to display placards like “Free Kashmir” and slogans like “Jinnah Vali Azadi”. Their model of ‘protecting the Constitution’ is planning to “separate Assam by blocking the Chicken Neck”. Their model of ‘protecting the Constitution’ is to desecrate the ‘Om’ and the ‘Swatstika’. Their model of ‘protecting the Constitution’ is by celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Kashmiri Pandits’ holocaust and exodus on 19.1.2020 as “Jasn-e-Shaheen”. And above all, their model of ‘protecting the Indian Constitution’ is by pressurising the Indian Government to give citizenship to the Muslims of Pakistan and Bangladesh because of whose persecution Hindus and Sikhs, etc., are fleeing from these countries to India for refuge.

12,21-2-20,Girl arrested for writing matric exam for boyfriend,"Obtaining an admit card fraudulently to appear in the annual matriculation examination for her boyfriend proved a girl dear as she was caught red-handed during the examination.

The incident was reported from Dhanupali in Sambalpur. Preliminary investigation suggested that the girl from Tilia village under the Rengali police limits was appearing in the examination in place of her beau.

Both the girl and the boy were arrested being booked under Sections 419, 420, 468 and 471 of IPC read with Section 9 of the Orissa Conduct of Examination Act-1988.

The boy candidate Laxman Meher of Mahulmunda village under the Sambalpur Town police station who was reading at the State Institute of Open School had been allotted his examination centre at the Commissioner Colony High School in the Dhanupali area. But his girlfriend Kamala Seth allegedly obtained a forged admit card in his name and went to sit for the examination.

During verification of admit cards before commencement of examination, the girl identified herself as ‘Laxmi Meher’ as mentioned in the document. When the examiners raised suspicion over the candidate, she evaded their question saying ‘error’ in the original admit card, which was issued in name of ‘Laxman Meher’.

The girl’s claim was proved false during scrutiny as the detailed information mentioned in the original admit card available with the Board of Secondary Education (BSE) authorities was mismatched with her admit card.

The examination invigilator left the candidate’s answer sheet unsigned and informed the examination centre superintendent in this regard, following which a written complaint was lodged with the Dhanupali police.

The police registered a case and arrested Laxman Meher and Kamala Seth. During interrogation, the girl confessed to the malpractice she attempted to help her boyfriend pass the examination.

Kamala forged the original admit card by editing her name and the photograph of the actual candidate. She was caught by the invigilator of the examination centre, according to police.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/girl-arrested-for-writing-matric-exam-for-boyfriend.html

19,21-2-20,Patia Big Bazaar mall sealed by BMC,"Acting tough on building rule violators, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday sealed the Big Bazaar shopping mall at Patia here.

It was alleged that the mall did not comply with parking stipulations and violated fire safety norms.

The shopping mall was sealed in presence of BMC Commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhary and Deputy Commissioner Srimanta Mishra and other BMC officials.

The operation to seal the building was initiated when the BMC officials who had come for an eviction drive in the nearby area, were informed about the shopping mall not having parking facilities. Soon after, the civic body officials swung into action.

During questioning, when the Big Bazaar authorities failed to show fire safety clearance certificate and give satisfactory answers, the officials served a show-cause notice to the building owner.

BMC Deputy Commissioner Mishra said the shopping mall has violated the BDA’s building approval plan by utilising the parking space for its godown.

“Instead of going to court, the officials formed a mobile court and passed the sealing order to the BMC North Zone Deputy Commissioner. They would seal the building. We have served a notice to the building owner Jitendra Prasad Singh as well. The building will be sealed till the shopping mall owner furnishes compliance certificate to the competent authorities,” he added.

As the mall is located near Patia Square, lack of parking space causes traffic snarls on the busy thoroughfare and affects traffic movement, said a BMC official.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/patia-big-bazaar-mall-sealed-by-bmc.html
20,21-2-20,Consumer body issues notice to Brand Factory,"The Khordha District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum has issued a notice to the Saheednagar-based retail store Brand Factory for charging customers to provide carry bags.

The forum gave the direction based on a case filed by a customer, Bobin Mohanty, a railway engineer. The next hearing of the case is scheduled for March 12.

Mohanty had purchased some garments from Brand Factory on November 27, 2019. The outlet had charged Rs 10 for paper carry bag in addition to the cost of garments.

Mohanty refused to pay but staffs of the store didn’t agree. Finally, he was forced to pay for the carry bag. Then Mohanty lodged a complaint against Brand Factory at the Consumer Counselling Centre at Khandagiri. But the dispute could not be settled.

So, finally Mohanty filed the case in the District Consumer Forum and the court admitted the case and issued the notice to Brand Factory.

In the petition, Mohanty stated that that the stores are compelling customer to purchase carry bags at last moment without displaying any information about the same at the entrance or other suitable locations.

He alleged that this is unfair trade practice and restrictive trade practice. As per Sales of Goods Act, the vendor should bear the cost of carry bag. Hence Brand Factory has been violating the Act since long.

Mohanty argued that when small shops and even big local shops like Kalamandir and Amber provide carry bags free of cost, then it is illegal to charge for carry bags by big shops having chain of stores throughout the country. He added that there is no rule to charge for carry bags. Prior to 2011, all shops were providing all types of carry bags free of cost.

But in 2011, it was made mandatory in Plastic Waste Rules that, “No plastic carry bag shall be made available free of cost by retailers to customers” and the same provision was also dropped in March 2018. But these big malls have continued charging for carry bags from gullible customers.

In eecent past, Chandigarh State Consumer Redressal Commission had fined several retailers like Bata India, Dominos and Big Bazaar for charging customers for carry bags, Mohanty said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/consumer-body-issues-notice-to-brand-factory.html

29,21-2-20,Drugs issue comes to Punjab House again,"The ghost of drugs on Thursday came haunting the Punjab politics with the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh assuring the Vidhan Sabha that a thorough investigation would be held into the drugs nexus of former SSB member Anwar Masih, who was recently arrested by the Special Task Force in a drug case, with political leaders.

The assurance came after the Congress MLA Kulbir Singh Zira flashed some documents and photographs to allege that Anwar Masih, caught by the STF on drugs in Rs 1000 crore drug recovery case, was a close associate of SAD MLA Bikram Majithia.

Joining in, the Leader of Opposition and AAP MLA Harpal Singh Cheema also demanded investigations into Majithia’s alleged role into the case, besides other political bigwigs.

Notably, the Punjab Police STF on drugs, a day before, arrested former Subordinate Services Board (SSB) member Anwar Masih in connection with the massive heroin haul, weighing 197 kgs, from his house in Sultanwind village on January 31. He was booked under the NDPS Act, and was remanded to two days’ police custody.

Taking serious note of the allegations, the Chief Minister maintained that all the documents or materials, shown or displayed by the members, would be forwarded to the STF for detailed investigations into the drugs network, launched in the wake of the seizures made from the house of Masih, an Akali leader.

The Chief Minister assured the House that a detailed inquiry would be conducted and the report in this regard would be forwarded to the competent authority.

At the same time, the Chief Minister made it clear that anyone suspected to be involved in the drug racket would be thoroughly probed to ascertain their links.

“The entire network would be unraveled to ensure that all those involved in the drugs racket were pinned down and action taken against them as per the law,” he added.

Earlier, Zira demanded an extensive probe to find why he was made SSB member and on whose recommendation and appropriate action should be taken.

Demanding to nab the “black sheep” in the political circles, he openly demanded that Majithia should also be put behind bars on whose recommendation Masih was appointed SSB member.

In sync with Zira’s demand, Cheema too asked the Government to investigate “Majithia's role” in Masih drug haul.

Cheema alleged that the multi-crore drug haul, involving the Akali leader Anwar Masih and councilor, had links with the political bigwigs.

“Whether the Chief Minister would give an assurance that he would investigate the role of Bikram Singh Majithia in the drug haul,” he asked after which the Chief Minister made the statement.

MASIH IS CONG LEADER, INQUIRE INTO CONG LINKS WITH DRUG MAFIA: SAD TO CM

Under attack, SAD MLA Bikram Majithia furnished photographs and documents to claim that Anwar Masih was a “Congress man”, and the Chief Minister should take into account detailed evidence of the involvement of Congress leaders in Amritsar heroin seizure case as well as drug trafficking in the State.

Majithia, at the same time, welcomed the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s statement in the Vidhan Sabha that he would order an inquiry into the political connections of Christian Dalit Front leader Anwar Masih.

“Masih’s close connection with the Congress and the support extended to the party by Anwar and Christian Front President Munawar Masih in 2017 assembly elections, 2018 Gurdaspur Lok Sabha by-election contested by Pradesh Congress president Sunil Jakhar as well as 2019 parliamentary elections were a matter of record. It is a fact that Munawar Masih was the only person whose term as Minorities Commission chairman was extended by three years by the Congress Government after being reappointed,” said Majithia while showing pictures of Munawar and Anwar Masih with Cabinet Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa in 2019 and advertisements alongside senior Congress leaders to claim that both of them are Congressmen.

Demanding a detailed inquiry into political connections of those associated with Amritsar heroin seizure case, Majithia said that the kingpin in the case – Simarjit Singh Sandhu — was the son of Sarabjit Singh Sandhu who was appointed Member of the Subordinate Services Selection Board in 2006 during Congress Government tenure.

“Simarjit Sandhu’s association with the Congress party should be investigated and all Congressmen associated with him should be exposed and booked,” he demanded while speaking with the media outside the Assembly.

Majithia also condemned photo-dramas being enacted in the assembly to divert the people’s attention from the power hike and power scams, farmer suicides, and the Congress Government’s failure to provide jobs to the youth.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/drugs-issue-comes-to-punjab-house-again.html

The vessels from Hong Kong reached here via Chittagong in Bangladesh on Wednesday.

After coming to know that the ships have come from China, panic spread among the locals about the new strain of corona virus spreading.

However, the district administration allayed the fears. ADM Shyambhakt Mishra said, “I spoke to the Dhamra Port Company Ltd (DPCL) authorities. They said two ships from Hong Kong have arrived here and the crew members have undergone screening for the deadly virus. There is no such indication and people shouldn’t panic.”

The ships would leave the coast after loading cargo from here. As they don’t have immigration passes, the crew members won’t be allowed to disembark, the port authorities said.

Notably, Hong Kong is controlled by the People’s Republic of China after it was liberated as a British colony in 1997.

Earlier this month, the Paradip Port Trust had not allowed crew members of seven ships to disembark at the port town in view of the rapidly spreading infection in Wuhan in central China.

While Leader of Opposition (LoP) Pradipta Naik alleged that the State Government is establishing and running Adarsha Vidyalayas with the interest money earned from Central funds, BJD members Pradeep Amat, Amar Prasad Satpathy and Bhupinder Singh demanded factual figures from Naik.

“The State Government has disengaged MCS Coordinators appointed by the Centre. While the Union Government had paid Rs 43 crore, the State Government has neither utilised it nor returned it to the Centre. The State Government is earning interest from the fund and running Adarsha Vidyalayas,” said Naik.

Raising a Point of Order, Amat said, “Adarsha Vidyalayas had been proposed during the UPA Government. However, when the BJP-led NDA Government came to the power in 2014, the then Union Finance Minister stopped the projects despite repeated requests from Odisha and other States. Then, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik resolved to establish such a school in each of 314 blocks. As of now, 190 schools are operating in Odisha for which the Union Government has not give a single penny,” said Amat, also a former Finance Minister.

Sources said that Mahto’s supporters on Wednesday tried to stop policemen from performing their duty and also raised a ruckus over the raid. Several local women carrying brooms in their hands blocked the way of the cops and created hurdles in the process of the raid. Mahto is a two-time legislator, and he managed to retain his Baghmara seat despite an anti-incumbency wave in Jharkhand during the 2019 Assembly polls.

Dhanbad police on Sunday lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against Mahto in connection with an extortion case of June 2018. Earlier in November 2018, a member of the BJP’s women’s wing had accused Mahto of molestation. She even alleged that the MLA had tried to rape her. And when she had resisted and didn’t give in to his sexual advance, she had been threatened, she said. Following which the woman had gone to Katras Police station to lodge an FIR against Mahto. However, the police did not act on her complaint.

Later, she lodged an online FIR. However, no action was taken on the online complaint, following which she moved to Jharkhand High Court, which on August 28, 2019, ordered Jharkhand police to lodge an FIR against Mahto.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dhullu-mahto-goes-traceless.html

As per the Central Government’s uniform smart driving licenses format, all new driving licenses (DL) issued by RTOs across the country will carry the same uniform look which means, same format, same colour, same design and same security features. All new DLs will also be embedded with a SIM card like microchip and QR codes.

new Assembly building at Kute village.

43,21-2-20,No help over phone for suicidal persons,"A person in distress may not get help over phone in first attempt, at least not if he or she dialed the emergency numbers of Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP) or Ranchi Institute of Neuro-Psychiatry and Allied Sciences (RINPAS) – two of the leading psychiatry institutes in Ranchi. While both the institutes claim that their helpline numbers have been functional, correspondents of this newspaper could not get a single response during inspection calls made in the past 48 hours.

CIP runs two landline numbers and a toll free number especially to cater to the needs of people in distress. These contact numbers double up as suicide helpline numbers for people who have suicidal thoughts and are in need of counseling to avert an extreme step. Correspondents dialed the CIP helpline number 1800-345-1849 – a 24-hour toll free helpline number – several times on Thursday morning but the number was said to be unavailable. Similarly, there was no response when the correspondents dialed helpline numbers – 0651-2451116 and 0651-2451115.

CIP Director Dr. D Ram, however, said that the contact number of the OPD was functional. “As far as my knowledge, the helpline numbers were functional. I will have to check with the concerned doctors to see if there was any malfunction,” he said.

RINPAS, on the other hand, does not have a dedicated suicide helpline number. Calls made to its OPD number, 0651- 2450813, are often received by a nurse or a clerk, who asks the caller to bring the patient to the institute for any query or check up. There is no provision of counseling a distressed person over phone.

“We are working on a dedicated suicide helpline, and it should be functional in the next fortnight. The team will have seven members, including counselors and psychotherapists to deal with emergency cases over phone,” said RINAS Director Dr. Subhash Soren.

The lack of help over phone is particularly a concern at this time of the year as many students are in distress during exams and results, say academicians.

On Wednesday, an Intermediate student of St. Xavier’s College committed suicide as he reportedly could not cope with the pressure of examination. Many such cases are reported every year. The rise in such incidents has also forced Jharkhand Academic Council (JAC) and many private schools to launch helpline numbers that offer counseling to distressed students.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-help-over-phone-for-suicidal-persons.html
44,21-2-20,Sheeshambada locals warn self-immolation,"The locals of Sheeshambada met the district administration officials and warned that if the solid waste management and recycling plant is not shifted or if No Objection Certificate (NOC) is issued to Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD), they will immolate themselves.

Some residents of Sheeshambada arrived at the district collectorate and submitted a memorandum to the official concerned.

In the memorandum, the locals alleged that the waste management plant is being operated illegally without an NOC from the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) for more than five months. According to the locals, several unauthorised activities are taking place in the plant too.

The Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) is getting dumped into a trench inside the waste management plant which is affecting the groundwater of the area. Besides, the untreated leachate has accumulated in the area making the nearby region marshy. According to one of the residents Rekha Chauhan, “I do not know if MCD workers pick the wet and dry garbage separately from the city but in the waste management plant they dump everything together; everything from wet, dry, decomposable matter like dead bodies of animals, and non-biodegradable matter like plastic and polythene is dumped there. How can MCD deny that there is no foul smell in the area due to the improper treatment of such garbage? No department is listening to our complaints.

Everyone is in connivance with the MCD. Probably when some local will take steps like self immolation, then the administration might wake up to the problems.”

The locals are questioning why the UEPPCB is neither accepting nor rejecting the application of MCD regarding NOC for past few months. The chairperson of State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) Usha Negi had also issued a notice to UEPPCB regarding the improper disposal of garbage which is reportedly affecting the children of the area.

However, municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey and project manager of Sheeshambada plant M A Saify have denied any kind of foul smell and disease causing germs in the area due to the plant.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sheeshambada-locals-warn-self-immolation.html

46,21-2-20,MCD extends property tax rebate for 5 days,"The Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) has extended the period of 20 per cent rebate on property tax by five more days. The rebate period was slated to end on February 25.

While talking to The Pioneer, the MCD tax superintendent Dharmesh Painuly said, “There are many slum dwellers who have not submitted the property tax till now so MCD gave them another chance to benefit from the rebate.

Besides, many people of new wards have also not submitted the non-residential property tax, so the rebate will probably encourage them to submit the taxes soon.” He also informed that till Thursday evening the total collection of property tax was around Rs 38 crore.

In the last two months, this is the third extension by MCD on the period of rebate on property tax. The first extension of this year was given by Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal 'Gama' in January for one month and the second was on February 15 for five days that ended on February 20.

Now MCD has once again extended the period of rebate which is probably due to the record breaking collection of the corporation in the last few months. The MCD has collected more than Rs 1 crore in a single day in January and till now it has collected around Rs 38 crore which is much higher than the total collection of last year which was around Rs 25 crore. The period of submitting property tax will end on March 31 after which a penalty will be imposed on those who have not paid their property tax. If the tax submission would be late by 30 days, five per cent of tax will be charged as penalty in the form of delay fee by MCD. It is pertinent to mention here that the rebate of 20 per cent is also given to non-residential taxpayers whereas five per cent additional rebate was set for the non-residential taxpayers of the new wards. However, the additional rebate which ended on January 31 was not extended further by mayor.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-extends-property-tax-rebate-for-5-days.html
47,21-2-20,"Govt to probe into Behbal Kalan, Bargari sacrilege cases","Decks are cleared for the Punjab Police to probe the Behbal Kalan and Bargari sacrilege cases. After the Supreme Court rejected the central probe agency’s plea against Punjab Government’s notification to withdraw investigations in the Behbal Kalan and Bargari cases from the CBI on the grounds of delay, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday announced that the cases will now be “investigated by the Punjab Police only”.

The Chief Minister, on the onset of Zero Hour, announced in the House that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) petition before the Supreme Court, challenging an earlier order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court that had upheld the notification of the Punjab Government to withdraw the investigation in the Behbal Kalan and Bargari sacrilege cases from the central probe agency, has been dismissed.

“Supreme Court has upheld the Government’s decision and now we would see what to be done,” he said while assuring that the SIT investigation into these cases would be taken to its logical conclusion.

Intervening, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Aman Arora welcomed the decision, but demanded that the Punjab Government should ensure time-bound investigations into the cases so that the guilty could be awarded punishment.

At the same time, he sought clarification from the Chief Minister whether the Supreme Court verdict related to all the cases — Behbal Kalan, Bargari-Kotakpura firing incident — to be precise pointing that all those were separate cases.

Going into background, the CBI had challenged the legality of the State Government’s September 2019 notification to withdraw the three sacrilege-related violence cases from it in the High Court but it had ruled that the chain of events showed that the same were inextricably linked and thus it did not feel the need to interfere in the decision of the State Government to withdraw investigation from the CBI or to set aside the consequent notifications.

With this, the Apex Coyrt has cleared the legal hurdle for the State to carry on its investigations into the sacrilege cases and the subsequent police firing in these cases, which were handed over to the CBI by the erstwhile SAD-BJP regime.

In view of the CBI’s failure to complete the probe in the cases, the Captain Amarinder government had announced in the House earlier that the cases would be taken back from the central agency and would be investigated by the state government.

During the hearing in the Apex Court, a division bench of Justice Rohington Nariman and Ravindra Bhatt dismissed the CBI case, rejecting the arguments of their advocate Aman Lekhi on the ground that instead of the 90 days given to the agency to file the SLP (special leave petition), it had taken 257 days to make its submission.

The Judge also rejected Lekhi’s argument that the CBI team had a problem on the legal issue as it would form precedent, and not on the investigation being transferred.

The Judge then ordered dismissal of the SLP on the ground of delay, while keeping the question of law open.

“Given this, the act of reverting the investigation to the State Police from CBI has now attained finality and no further fetter remains on the SIT to investigate the same,” said the state Advocate-General Atul Nanda.

He underlined that as per previous judgments, “once investigation is transferred to CBI, it cannot be withdrawn. Those cases were decided on their own facts, but the question of whether the state legislature has the power to take back an investigation from CBI, in terms of general clauses act, was left open”.

The prosecution’s case was that the three FIRs in the sacrilege cases were initially registered by the Punjab Police but the investigation was later handed over by the State of Punjab to CBI. It was submitted that since the CBI had filed a joint Closure Report in the above said three cases, the state of Punjab requires the certified copy of joint report along with the copies of documents attached thereto for its official use.

It was further submitted by the prosecution that only the investigation was transferred and CBI had been informing the stage of investigation to the State of Punjab from time to time.

Further, the prosecution argued that later on, a resolution was passed by the Punjab Legislative Assembly vide which the investigation was taken back from the CBI and accordingly, on September 6, 2018, a notification was issued by the State of Punjab, withdrawing the consent to the CBI to investigate the case.

The said resolution and the notification were challenged in the High Court, which, vide judgment reported as 2019(2) RCR Criminal, Page 165, upheld the notification. The CBI did not file any SLP and thus, after the withdrawal of the consent, the State had full right to investigate the cases, it was argued for the state.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-to-probe-into-behbal-kalan--bargari-sacrilege-cases.html

Opposition and ruling members debated the issue on an Adjournment Motion brought by the BJP in the State Assembly on Thursday.

“People are still going outside in search of work. More than 1.5 lakh Government posts are lying vacant for long. There have been irregularities in selection of beneficiaries under various schemes. Eligible poor people are not getting Government benefits. PC taking has been a practice during the last 20 years,” alleged BJP chief whip Mohan Majhi.

Another Congress member, Suresh Routray slammed the Government for incurring loans.

BJD members Amar Prasad Satpathy, Dhruba Charan Sahoo, Prafulla Samal and Aswhini Kumar Patra participating in the discussion refuted the charges.

In his reply, Planning and Convergence Minister Padmanabha Behera said the rate of poverty was reduced from 57.20 per cent in 2004-05 to 32.59 per cent in 2011-12 and the reduction of 24.61 per cent was highest among States in the country.

Behera also claimed that Odisha has emerged as a food surplus State from a food deficient on. He said the figures submitted by him are based on the survey report of the Union Planning Commission and the NITI Aayog.

62,21-2-20,Defining rationality and irrational challenges,"Essential Irrationality by MA Alam was recently brought out by Blue Rose Publishers. This book discusses how irrationalities affect our lives, and how to cope with them. Irrationalities in our behaviour have been observed to be essential aspects of human nature.

Most of the irrationalities have their origin in the adaptive strategies developed by millions of years of evolution to cope with the harsh environmental conditions of the ancient past of humans.

Consequently, people developed quick response systems to meet successfully the challenges of their ancestral environment. They were essential for human survival, but a few have now become redundant in the modern conditions, and are looked down as ridiculous biases. Some irrationalities have actually been found to be essential and beneficial for the well being and growth of the species.

During the last few thousand years of human development, people additionally acquired a large number of belief systems, superstitions and faiths. Some of these beliefs are not quite rational and reasonable. They mould the human personality by affecting opinions, decisions, actions and behaviours. According to author, “When you hold beliefs without ascertaining their validity, you start losing your ability to doubt and question your beliefs. Fortunately, along with these developments we also created a reservoir of verifiable knowledge by using rational methods during last few hundred years of our existence. We have a responsibility to familiarise ourselves with these techniques to avoid pitfalls of assuming all beliefs to be true.” This book is currently available at Amazon bookstore.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/defining-rationality-and---irrational-challenges.html

The message also stated that the company in which they are working has stopped their payments. They were locked in a room and getting several threats,” he said.

Trapped labourers are Raju Paswan, Khublal Paswan, Vijay Kumar Mahato, Yogendra Kumar, Devi Lal Mahto, Santosh Mahato, Alam Kumar Mahato, Chandrika Mahato, Teklal Mahato, Mahesh Kumar Mahato, Rajesh Kumar, Sohan Lal Mahato, Pradeep Mahato, Hemlal Mahato, Nirmal Mahato, Sohan Mahato, Govind Mahato, Rajesh Prasad Mahato, Jagdish Mahato, Kasumbha Rooplal Mahato, Mahesh Mahato, Vinod Kumar, Ramchandra Mahato, Dilip Kumar, Premchand Mahato, Manoj Mahato, Hulas Mahato, Jagdish Mahato and Mahendra Singh, Ali said.

69,21-2-20,Nationalism likened to Nazism: Bhagwat,"Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday said the word “nationalism” is nowadays equated with Hitler’s “nazism” or Mussolini’s “fascism” and it is better to avoid this word, stressing on using some alternative terms.

Bhagwat’s remark came amid continued protests in several cities of the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which is branded by those opposing the CAA as a reflection of “Hindutva nationalism” that is detrimental to Muslims.

Besides, analysing the results of this month’s Delhi Assembly polls, the BJP’s ideological mentor RSS said in an editorial in its mouthpiece on Thursday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah cannot always help the BJP win Assembly elections.

Recalling an RSS event in the United Kingdom (UK), Bhagwat said, “During my recent visit to the UK, I was advised by an RSS worker not to use the word ‘nationalism’ as English is not our language and it could have a different meaning in England. It's okay to say nation, national and nationality but not nationalism. Because it means (alludes to) Hitler, Nazism and Fascism (in England).”

Calling upon RSS members to connect with people irrespective of their caste, language, religion or region, Bhagwat said India’s characteristic is to bind everyone in one thread following the principle of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (the world is a family).

“We (Indians) live for each other, not for ourselves. We believe that the world has made us and we have to give back to it. We look at the world with gratitude,” he said.

Sharing an anecdote, he said, a Muslim intellectual from the country once went for Haj and was sent to jail on blasphemy charges for wearing a “locket”. The then Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj, intervened and got him released within eight days, he said, apparently suggesting that everyone from India is considered a Hindu outside the country.

“...Because Bharatiya sanskriti (Indian culture) is also known as Hindu sanskriti, reflecting its values, ethos and culture,” he said.

The RSS chief also gave a call to make India a superpower.

Bhagwat said, “The aim of the Sangh is to unite Hindu society. The Swayamsevaks are dedicated to their aim. By feeling proud of the culture of our country we have to work to take the country to new heights. We have to make India a world ‘Guru’. It is time to make India a superpower, but not like other superpowers that misuse their influence.”

He added, “What do countries do when they become the strongest? With superpower status they try to exert their influence on other countries, exploiting their resources for themselves. This is the reason researchers think that a country becoming too powerful is bad for the world.”

Bhagwat, who is on a five day visit to Jharkhand, was addressing “Sangh Samagam” of RSS volunteers on college ground of Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee University, Morhabadi, Ranchi.

The meeting was attended by former Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das, Ranchi MLA and former Minister CP Singh, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth and BJP leaders, besides RSS volunteers.

The RSS chief, on the occasion, also expressed concern over environmental imbalance urging the people to work for protecting the environment. He said entire world has seen the affects of playing with environment and in present context China is an example.

Bhagwat, who enjoys Z+ security cover by a special group of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) due to the threat perception against him, reached Birsa Munda Airport on Wednesday. On Thursday apart from attending the Sangh Samagam, he also addressed a meeting on IIM campus, followed by meeting at Maheshwari Bhavan. The RSS chief will be in State capital on Friday and Saturday too and will leave for Giridih the same day.

The RSS chief visit to State assumes importance as there are around 60,000 full time RSS worker in State and the organisation is working to increase its members. In Jharkhand the Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram a wing of RSS has its activities for Scheduled Tribes in remote areas of Jharkhand.

The BJP tasted defeat in the Delhi Assembly elections for the second consecutive time, increasing its tally from three to just eight seats, while Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) scooped 62 of 70 seats.

The article in The Organiser said, “...the apparent failure of BJP to revitalise the organisational structure at the grassroots level after 2015 and building up of the campaign on in the last leg of the elections were the two major reasons for defeat in the well-fought out battle. But Narendra Modi and Amit Shah cannot always help out in the Assembly level elections and there is no option but to rebuild the organisation in Delhi to address the local aspirations of the masses is the clear message,” it added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nationalism-likened-to-nazism--bhagwat.html

Again, it was mentioned that the fund can be used for such purposes in the name of community centre. This way the Government has suggested for violation of law,” said Mishra.

He said the Government’s claim of increasing MLA LAD fund is not true. “Finance Minister Nirajan Pujari stated in his Budget speech that the amount of MLA LAD fund has been increased three-fold. But the fact is that MLAs were getting 1.50 crore a year from which the Government has slashed Rs 50 lakh under a head. Now, the Government has increased the amount Rs 3 crore. How can it be said that the MLA LAD fund increased three-fold,” wanted to know Mishra.

He too refuted Pujari’s budgetary hike claim for Education and Agriculture Sectors. “It is mentioned that the funds have been allocated for Education and Agriculture sectors at 3.38 per cent and 3.25 per cent of the State Gross Domestic Products in 2020-21. However, the last year’s figures of two departments were 3.50 per cent and 3.3 per cent of SGDP, respectively.

It is a sheer example of the State Government furnishing untrue information in the House,” alleged Mishra further.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-govt-furnishing-false-data--narasingha.html

89,21-2-20,HC seeks city Govt's reply on convict’s plea for early release,"The Delhi High Court asked the AAP Government on Thursday to reply to a plea by Jessica Lal murder convict Manu Sharma, serving life imprisonment, seeking premature release.

Justice Brijesh Sethi asked the Delhi Government to file a status report in the matter along with the relevant records of Sentence Review Board (SRB). The court listed the matter for further hearing on March 30.

Sharma has sought direction to set aside the September 19, 2019 order of the competent authority which had accepted the July 19 last year recommendations of SRB rejecting his early release plea.

The petition, filed through advocate Amit Sahni, sought Sharma's release saying the authorities rejected his plea in an unfair, arbitrary and whimsical manner.

It contended that Sharma was being victimised by the State and despite having undergone 23 years (with remission) in jail, his case was rejected four times. It claimed that he has been rewarded appreciations for his efforts through his NGO ""Siddhartha Vashishtha Cheritable Trust"".

""The petitioner (Sharma) has had an unblemished record throughout incarceration and there has been nothing adverse against him. His reformative actions and efforts for helping children of jail inmates has been appreciated by the Lt. Governor of Delhi as well as the Division Bench of High Court of Delhi,"" the plea said.

Sharma, son of former Union minister Venod Sharma, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the high court in December, 2006 for killing Jessica Lal in 1999.

The trial court had acquitted him, but the Delhi High Court had reversed the order and the Supreme Court had upheld his life sentence in April, 2010.

Lal was shot dead by Sharma after she had refused to serve him liquor at Tamarind Court restaurant owned by socialite Bina Ramani at Qutub Colonnade in south Delhi's Mehrauli area on the night of April 30, 1999.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hc-seeks-city-govt-s-reply-on-convict---s-plea-for-early-release.html

“People have compared the development-oriented governance of Samajwadi Party to the BJP regime’s functioning of high-pitch sound bites and little work. Thus, they now want the Samajwadi Party to return to power,” the SP chief said while addressing party workers in the state SP office in Lucknow on Thursday.

“During the SP regime, we provided free irrigation to farmers and also introduced Kisan Durghatna Beema Yojana to benefit the community. On the contrary, the BJP government has pushed farmers towards the blind alley of deprivation,” he added

“Reports of farmers committing suicide in Bundelkhand have shaken public conscience but not of BJP leaders. In Bundelkhand, farmers are neck-deep in debt and hence forced to end their lives. Similarly, farmers growing cane, potato and paddy are also in distress. The BJP had promised to double farmers’ income by 2022 but they have so far failed to come up with a solution,” he alleged.

Akhilesh said that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s statement, ‘those who come out on the streets come to die’, hinted at his arrogance.

“In democracy, every individual has the right to dissent but this government does not want any one to air their views,” he alleged.

The SP chief further said: “Law and order in the state has gone from bad to worse. Incidents of rape are being reported almost every day but the CM says that crime is under control.

109,21-2-20,Govt aims to reduce pollution by 1,"Setting a target to reduce one third of the pollution in the national Capital, in its third tenure of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Government, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Thursday chaired a meeting with Delhi Pollution control Committee (DPCC) officials.

Scientists, environmentalists and forest officials aired their views to prepare a comprehensive action plan to mitigate the impact of pollution. The Minister is expected to host another meeting with environment experts for assessing environmental solutions on February 27.

Curbing air pollution was one of the key agenda that AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal had promised to the people during Delhi Assembly elections. Kejriwal had listed its 10 guarantee schemes and had set a target to plant 2 crore trees across the city. Environment Minister will visit Washington University headquarter, near Major Dhyanchand stadium to understand the process of obtaining 'real time air pollution data'.

Soon after his meeting with officials, Rai addressed the media and said Delhi government has partnered with Washington University to obtain Real- Time data to monitor major air pollution source. ""The environmental issues pertaining to Delhi have been a subject of constant deliberation and concern."" ""A lot of work has been done in this sector, as a result of which the Delhi government has been able to reduce around 25 percent of pollution levels in the city, along with the support of various agencies and the people of Delhi,"" said Rai.

According to Delhi government officials, a report prepared with Washington University on Delhi pollution source will be released in March this year

Elaborating further minutes of meeting with forest officials, Rai said, "" I met with the environment department officials, DPCC scientists, forest department officials, to discuss the efforts taken by the Delhi government towards bettering the environment and the impact that it has created.""

Rai mentioned about car rationing Odd-Even scheme and stubble burning in Delhi's neighborhoods during winters. ""The implementation of the Odd-Even scheme has been a matter of friction since people believe that vehicular emissions do not constitute a major part of the air pollution levels in Delhi."" ""Obtaining Real-Time Data is necessary to monitor the real sources of pollution at a particular point in time. Until we can gather information about the sources of pollution, we will not be able to devise any mechanism for reducing these sources,"" he asserted.

To tackle pollution issue, it is first need to learn that source of pollution because there is no generalised source and we cannot work on decreasing or eradicating this pollution in generalized manner, hence we need to obtain Real-time Data to devise an action plan to reduce pollution,"" the AAP minister added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-aims-to-reduce-pollution-by-1-3rd.html

Soon after Lallu led the march sporting blue bandana along with some leaders and chanted ‘Jai Bhim’, Congress candidate from Lucknow in 2019 Lok Sabha poll Acharya Pramod Krishnam took a jibe at Lallu tweeting that it would be better if the Congress also adopted the symbol of ‘Elephant’ so that Dalits voted for the party in the upcoming polls.

Another BSP-hopper and Congress candidate from Mohanlalganj Lok Sabha seat, RK Chaudhary, also chose to distance himself from the Congress march. Instead, he took out a separate march on Thursday under the banner of BS-4, attacking Centre’s move of opposing reservation in promotion in government jobs. However, no disciplinary notice was served on Chaudhary so far for taking out a separate march.

Interestingly, Krishnam’s tweets got support from another Congress leader, Siraj Mehdi, who also criticised Lallu for going against the Congress’s ideology and treading the path of BSP. Mehdi was recently expelled from Congress along with some veteran leaders.

The tweets of Krishnam and Mehdi arebeing seen as an attack on Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as just a week back, she visited Varanasi and paid obeisance at the birthplace of Sant Ravidas, eying the Dalit vote bank.

A former UP Congress spokesman opined, “Lallu’s recent move is merely an extension of Priyanka to woo Dalits and hence an attack on the UP unit chief would clearly be construed as an attack on Priyanka.”

A senior Congress leader from east UP and Lallu confidante, however, came out in support of the Congress stand of trying to woo Dalits.

132,21-2-20,No reason why Central Vista can’t be rebuilt: Puri,"Amid concerns and criticisms, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Thursday said that Government infrastructure, including the North and South Blocks, was built more than a century ago and there is no reason why the Centre should not go for a new-look Central Vista aesthetically while preserving the heritage.

Speaking at a function, Puri said that some people are talking about the Central Vista makeover without knowing what is happening. “Look every 100 years somebody has to take charge and decide what the city is going to look like. Delhi in its present from...The current Delhi Governmental infrastructure (including) Rashtrapati Bhavan, North Block, South Block, were built in 1910s or 1920s,” Puri added.

The questions are being raised by experts from various quarters that what is the need to do so and what’s the objective and why it is being implemented. “We are paying thousands of crores of rent to house Government buildings. We have the land, so there is no reason why we can’t do it in an architecturally, aesthetic way, preserve the heritage etc and create a New Delhi,” he said.

Sources said that the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has received nearly 400 objections to the proposed change of land use for 101 acres in central Delhi for the Centre’s ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project. The objections range from questioning the need for the project to its impact on environment and traffic. Some also stressed on the need to protect heritage and demanded a proper assessment before going ahead with the plan.

LokPATH (people for Appropriate Transformation of Habitat), a collective of urban development experts, which was formed recently, has flagged the lack of transparency in the process of land use change. The Indian Society of Landscape Architects (ISOLA) has called the project an “inappropriate planning decision”. Many have questioned the need for the project and said it contradicts the provisions of the Master Plan of Delhi 2021.

One more Indian aboard a quarantined cruise ship off Japan was tested positive for the novel coronavirus and shifted to hospital, taking the number of Indian nationals infected with the virus on the vessel to eight, the Indian embassy said on Thursday. China has reported 2,118 deaths while the overall confirmed cases has climbed to 74,576.

All 8 Indians receiving treatment are responding well. Rest all Indians on-board are braving out the trying circumstances.”

Earlier, seven Indians were tested positive for the COVID-19. The mission said that infected Indians were responding well to the treatment.

Many countries have banned arrivals from China while major airlines have suspended flights to the country. In India, national carrier Air India has announced that it is extending the suspension of its flights to the neighbouring country till June 30.

The discharge of the women medico student marked the recovery of all three cases of infection in India reported from Kerala. Two other students — one from Alappuzha and another Kasaragod — had been discharged recently after they too tested negative for the virus in fresh tests days after being infected by it.

136,21-2-20,"20 die in in TN bus tragedy, survivors shell-shocked","A road crash in Tamil Nadu early Thursday left 20 dead and 28 injured as a lorry collided with their bus reducing it to a mangled heap.

Police said the accident occurred on the Salem-Kochi highway at Avinashi in Tirupur around 4 am as the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus was proceeding to Ernakulam from Bengaluru Tirupur is located about 450 km from here.

Most of the passengers were asleep when the lorry crashed into the bus.

The lorry driver, Ernakulam native Hemaraj, was arrested later.

The tiles-laden container lorry’s tyre burst and it entered the wrong lane colliding with the bus, reducing the vehicle to a mangled heap, police said.

The 20, including six women, died at the scene while the injured were admitted to hospitals in Tirupur and some referred to Coimbatore, police said.

Palakkad Superintendent of Police Siva Vikram said “It was a high speed collision. The container lorry went out of control.”

The accident came as a shock to many in the state since one of such a magnitude has not happened in Tamil Nadu in the recent past.

There were 48 passengers on board the bus.

The lorry suffered a tyre burst before colliding with the KSRTC bus, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami said in the State Assembly, adding, all the victims were Keralites.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Palaniswami, and Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan condoled the deaths.

“Extremely anguished by the bus accident...In this hour of grief, my thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families. I hope those who are injured recover at the earliest,” the PM’s Office said in a tweet quoting Modi.

Though reports initially suggested the bus was proceeding towards Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, officials later clarified its destination was Ernakulam.

Palaniswami said he has asked the Tirupur administration to coordinate with their Palakkad counterparts, to expedite activities including sending the bodies of the deceased to Kerala.

Further, 23 people were seriously injured and were undergoing treatment while five others sustained simple injuries and were proceeding to Kerala, he said.

“I have directed the Tirupur collector and police officials there to set up a help centre to assist the relatives of the victims and also expedite the process of sending the bodies of the deceased by contacting Kerala officials,” he said.

In Thiruvananthapuram, Vijayan deputed his cabinet colleagues—Transport Minister AK Saseendran and Agriculture Minister VS Sunilkumar, to Tirupur to coordinate relief operations, his office said.

The Kerala delegation later arrived in Tirupur.

Saseendran, Sunilkumar, Palakkad MP VK Sreekandan, and Alathur MP Ramya Haridas besides MLAs from Kerala are camping at Tirupur.

“The State Government will provide a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the bereaved families, Rs two lakh will be given within a week. The rest of the amount will be given following the procedures,” Saseendran said.

“The families of the KSRTC employees will be given Rs 30 lakh each under the insurance scheme,” he added.

The State Government has also declared that it will take care of the medical expenses of the injured passengers.

The Health department has sent ambulances to Tirupur to bring back the bodies. The accident left the survivors shell-shocked.

Karishma, on her way to Ernakulam, said she was seated on the left side of the bus and was sleeping when the accident occurred.

“When I woke up suddenly, I saw many people running around and the injured being taken in ambulances,” the woman told the media.

Alan, also from Kerala, said he was still finding it difficult to overcome the shock.

“I have sustained a minor injury on my leg. But my friend is injured on the nose and I am taking him to hospital,” he said.

Jemin George, an injured passenger, said he suffered a cut on his lips and an injury to his forehead that required 10 stitches.

“I do not know what exactly happened. I was sleeping in a seat behind the driver’s seat,” he said, adding, he was referred to a hospital in Coimbatore.

138,21-2-20,Efforts made to address concerns: MEA,"A day after US President Donald Trump said in Washington that India has not treated his country “very well,” on issues of bilateral trade, the Ministry of External Affairs on Thursday said the context in which the remarks were made was balance of trade and there have been efforts to address the concerns. The US President’s remarks came days ahead of his maiden two-day visit to India commencing February 24.

Looking forward to his visit to India, Trump had said India has not treated his country “very well” on the trade front and indicated that a “very big” bilateral deal with New Delhi may not be signed before the American presidential election in November.

Trump, forcefully pursuing his ‘America first” policy, has previously described India as a “tariff king” for imposing “tremendously high” tariffs on American products, also expressed dissatisfaction over the US-India trade ties. “Well, we can have a trade deal with India, but I’m really saving the big deal for later on,” Trump told reporters at the Joint Base Andrews outside Washington on Tuesday when asked whether he expects a trade deal with India before the visit.

Asked about his comments, the External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said here it is important to understand the context in which the remarks were made. The context was balance of trade and efforts have been made to address concerns, he said.

India is eagerly awaiting President Trump’s visit and it will strengthen the bilateral global strategic ties, Kumar said. He also said “we don’t want to create any artificial deadline” replying to question on when India-US trade deal will be signed.

On how many agreements will be signed during Trump’s India visit, Kumar said around five MoUs were under discussion. Asked whether the issues relating to H1B visa will figure in Modi-Trump talks, Kumar said they could come up.

Trump will reach Ahemdabad on February 24 where a grand event - called “Namaste Trump” - to welcome him will “showcase India’s rich and diverse culture that will have few parallels in India or elsewhere”.

“US President Trump will land in Ahmedabad around noon, from there he will go to the Motera Stadium to address the ‘Namaste Trump’ event. The route from the airport to the stadium -- we expect a large number of people will line-up,” Ravish Kumar said.

Talking of the route from the Ahmedabad airport to the stadium, he said, “We expect a large number of people lined up along the route”. So far, 28 stages have been set up which will represent various parts of the country, on which artistes will be performing.

The roadshow will feature Mahatma Gandhi’s life and the programme at the Motera Stadium would be like the “Howdy Modi” event, he said referring to the mega programme at Houston in US, where Trump had shared stage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and addressed the assembled Indians.

The other stop on Trump’s schedule is Agra and the last stop is New Delhi where Modi and Trump will hold talks on the entire range of bilateral issues including defence and trade. Incidentally, it will be the fifth meeting between Modi and Trump in the last eight months.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/efforts-made-to-address-concerns--mea.html
139,21-2-20,SC verdict gives clarity in moving forward: Naravane,"Days after the landmark Supreme Court judgment directing the Government to grant permanent commission and command postings to women officers, Army Chief MM Naravane on Thursday said his force has been championing gender equality and the apex court verdict has given the Army clarity to move forward.

In a momentous ruling on Monday, the apex court on Monday had called for a “change in mindsets” and directed that women officers of the Army, serving under Short Service Commission(SSC), be considered for grant of Permanent Commission, irrespective of tenure of service, and also for command posts in non-combat areas since “an absolute bar on women seeking criteria or command appointments would not comport with the guarantee of equality under Article 14.”

Making the Army’s stand clear, the Army Chief said here the Indian Army does not discriminate any soldier based on religion, caste, creed, or even gender. The outlook of the Indian Army has been throughout like this and “that is why we started inducting women officers as early as in 1993.”

Outlining steps taken to induct women in the force, he said the Army has taken the initiative to induct women in rank and file, and the first batch of 100 women soldiers is undergoing training at Corps of Military Police Centre and School, he said.

Supreme Court’s decision is a welcome one as it brings out a sense of clarity and purpose to gainfully employ officers for better efficiency of the organisation. I must assure that everybody in the Indian Army including women officers will be given equal opportunity to contribute to the nation as also progress in their careers,” he said hailing the verdict as enabling. Naravane also said letters are being sent to women officers asking whether they will prefer permanent commission.

The court has given three months’ time to the Government to implement its verdict and Naravane said a roadmap has been prepared for its implementation. He also said there is equal opportunity for everyone and there is no gender discrimination. “We have drafted a plan” he stated.

Same procedure for male Short Service Commission (SSC) officers will be followed for women to give permanent commission, the Army chief clarified adding “it will be same rule for everyone.”

Observing that the judgement is for those who have crossed a certain point in their career in the Army, he said those rules for young officers will not be applied on them. In the next batch of women officers trained all these factors will be discussed, he stated.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-verdict-gives-clarity-in-moving-forward--naravane.html

142,21-2-20,"MEA: Arunachal part of India, China’s objection to Shah visit not reasonable","As China on Thursday objected to Home Minister Amit Shah’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh, saying the visit had violated its territorial sovereignty and “sabotaged” mutual trust with India, New Delhi asserted the eastern State is an integral part of the country. Moreover, objection to an Indian Minister’s visit there does not stand to reason, it reiterated.

The Home Minister is in Arunachal Pradesh to attend functions related to the 34th Statehood Day of the northeastern state and launched projects including industry and road infrastructure. China has always claimed the border State as part of south Tibet and routinely criticises the visit of any Indian official to the region.

Objecting to Shah’s visit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said “China’s position on the eastern sector of the China-India boundary, or the southern part of China’s Tibet region, is consistent and clear.”

Responding to a question about Shah’s visit, the spokesperson said “the Chinese Government has never recognised the so-called ‘Arunachal Pradesh’ and is firmly opposed to the Indian politician’s visit to the southern part of China’s Tibet region as it violated China’s territorial sovereignty, undermined stability of the border area, sabotaged political mutual trust, and violated relevant bilateral agreement,” Geng. The official also said India should stop taking any action that may “further complicate the border issue.”

Asked about China’s objection to Shah’s visit, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said here on Thursday India’s consistent position has been that the State is its integral and inalienable part. Objecting to visit to Arunachal by an Indian leader does not stand to reason, he said.

China last year too raised similar issue when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh visited Arunachal Pradesh to take stock of the security situation in the frontier border region.

Earlier in 2019, customs authorities in a northeastern Chinese city had destroyed nearly 30,000 world maps showing Arunachal Pradesh as a part of India and Taiwan as a separate country.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mea--arunachal-part-of-india--china---s-objection-to-shah-visit-not-reasonable.html

The PHE workers had begun their strike on February 7. The stir has led to a drinking water crisis in most parts of the Jammu region.

“We have decided to extend the ongoing strike by 72 hours and if the Government failed to address our issues, we have no option but to hit the roads,” a leader of the protesters said. Police on Wednesday foiled an attempt by thousands of PHE workers to stage a rally from the office of the chief engineer to the Raj Bhavan here.

“After the end of the 72-hour deadline, over 22,000 workers from across the Jammu region will gather here and come on the roads to press for their genuine demands,” the leader said. He said the wages of the workers are pending for the last 65 months, while they have served the department for over two decades with a hope that their services will get regularised one day.

“We have only got assurances from time and again and therefore, we will not budge till our demands are met...With or without Article 370, our fate remains the same and our families are suffering due to the failure of the Government to address our issues,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/phe-workers-extend-strike-by-72-hours-across-jammu.html
146,21-2-20,No scheme of BJP Govt worth mentioning: Cong,"Calling BJP Government in Karnataka as “a child born illicitly from Operation Kamala”, the Opposition Congress on Thursday warned the ruling party that people would punish it, if it doesnt keep the promise of making the state a ‘Rama Rajya.’

Alleging that the BS Yediyurappa-led Government in the state has not come to power with the mandate of the people, but only by engineering the defection of 17 Congress-JD(S) legislators, the Leader of Opposition in the assembly Siddaramaiah said there was no programme from the current dispensation worth mentioning in the last seven to eight months.

“There is no programme of the BJP Government in the last 7-8 months that is worth mentioning; all the mentions made in the address are of previous Congress and coalition Government, he said.

He accused the Government of failing to get the right share of central funds to the state on time, despite having the same party in power at the Centre.

Siddaramaiah said there would be over a Rs 11,000-crore shortfall in tax devolution to Karnataka during 15th finance commission, while warning that “We are going to suffer if this continues and the administration doesnt act.”

You (BJP) people had said that you will make Karnataka a Rama Rajya if party comes to power both at the state and the Centre...Where is it? Do it,” he said.

You (BJP) will construct Ram Mandir and bring in Uniform Civil Code, because it is your agendabut also make efforts towards building Rama Rajya as you had promised or else you may have

to eat your own words, and people will punish you, he said.

Participating in the debate on the motion of thanks to Governors address in the assembly, Siddaramaiah said the state government has failed to give any preview through the address.

The Governors address doesnt have anything from this Government, except the state providing Rs 4,000 crore in addition to the Central governments Rs 6,000 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-scheme-of-bjp-govt-worth-mentioning--cong.html

Pillai, while addressing a programme here on the occasion, said, “The signing of the historic Mizo Peace Accord on June 30, 1986 remains a beacon of hope for the world that peace can be attained and sustained if the people and leaders choose it over violence.”

Mizoram became the 23rd state of India in 1987 after the Mizo National Front (MNF) signed the peace accord with the Centre, ending a two-decade-long insurgency.

Before attaining statehood, Mizoram was union territory.

Observing that Mizoram’s endeavour since attaining statehood has been to attain self-reliance, Pillai urged the state government and denizens not to solely rely on central funding.

“Mizoram is abundantly blessed with resources in horticulture, handloom, handicrafts, human resource and tourism sectors, which we need to tap. It is our duty to provide a congenial socio-economic setting where our youth can flourish with pride,” he said.

He called upon the state government to work towards achieving a welfare state.Pillai said the Centre has allocated 10 per cent of the Union budget for the development of the Northeast.

Accordingly, Kishore who has reportedly been hired by the ruling Trinamool Congress to chalk out its strategy road map ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections is likely to get ‘Z’ category security cover which is provided among others former Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, senior Ministers like Partho Chatterjee, Firhad Hakim, Suvendu Adhikary, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and another 5-6 persons.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and his nephew and MP Abhishek Banerjee gets ‘Z Plus’ security cover.

The security personnel will be drawn from the trained officers of Kolkata Police and Bengal Police, sources said adding the decision to provide security cover to Kishore was taken following a meeting of the security directorate officials.

Significantly the meeting took place following two developments. First, Kishore’s expulsion from the Jantadal United Party of Nitish Kumar and second his decision to launch ‘Baat Bihar Ki’.

“A meeting was called where his security was reviewed and its upgradation was recommended to the State Government,” sources said.

However officials in Kishore’s election management company said they did not have any information about the new security proposals.

Bengal has seen a lot of political murders over the past one decade or so. One such victim of recent escalated political hostilities was a Trinamool Congress MLA from Nadia.

Satyajit Biswas Krishanganj MLA was murdered near house in Nadia. Local BJP MP who was named among 43 others was recently grilled for four hours by the State CID regarding his alleged role in the murder.

With TMC’s position improving since the losses it suffered in last year’s Parliamentary elections—when the party conceded 18 out of 42 seats to the BJP —thanks Kishore’s reported strategic manipulations the Bengal ruling party wants him secured at any cost, experts said.

153,21-2-20,"Nirogi Rajasthan, wealthy farmer top priorities for Raj Govt: Gehlot","The Rajasthan Budget is based on seven resolutions, including Nirogi Rajasthan and efforts are being made so that development is not interrupted in the State despite various challenges, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said on Thursday.

Presenting the Budget for FY2020-21 in the Rajasthan Assembly, Gehlot referred to the public welfare measures in the last Budget, and said that his Government has tried to present a concrete action plan in this Budget also.

He levied no new tax proposals and announced to fill 53,151 new vacancies. He also announced rebate of Rs 130 crore in different kinds of taxes.

This is the second Budget of the Congress Government, which came to power in the state in December 2018.

“For us the entire Rajasthan is like a family. For this family, I want to make seven resolutions as priorities of this Budget,” Gehlot said.

These resolutions are healthy Rajasthan, prosperous farmers, welfare of women, children and elderly, capable labourers, youth-students, education, water power and roads, skills and technology, he

added.

Chief Minister Gehlot who also holds finance portfolio said the Central government’s revenue has reduced due to its wrong economic policies and Rajasthan is also suffering due to this.

He said that state’s share in the central taxes has been reduced by Rs 10,362 crore.

Gehlot said the financial condition of the states in the federal system depends on the policies and decisions of the central government to a large extent and noted that today most economic indicators indicate that the country’s economic condition has

derailed.

“We have made efforts to make it an inclusive budget by keeping in mind the views and suggestions of farmers, cattle rearers, women, students, youth, industrial and business organisations and civil society,” Gehlot said.

He said, it is important to present the true picture of the economic situation of the country before giving details of far-reaching steps that are likely to be taken in the coming year by the state government to achieve the overall development of the state.

“The reason for mentioning the financial position of the states in our federal system depends on the policies and decisions of the Centre to a large extent. Today, most of the indices of the country’s economy indicate that the country’s economy is currently going through a bad phase,” he said.

The World Bank, IMF and ADB have slashed growth rate projections. According to the Economic Survey 2019-20 India’s GDP growth rate is estimated to be 5 per cent, he added.

The Chief Minister said the Central Government raises funds in many ways such as by taking money from the Reserve Bank, disinvesting in Air India and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), reducing the stake in LIC whereas the states have no such option. He said that despite these challenges, we have tried that the road to development in this budget is not obstructed.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nirogi-rajasthan--wealthy-farmer-top-priorities-for-raj-govt--gehlot.html
154,21-2-20,Mamata writes to Modi about ‘steady reduction’ of funds,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, expressing concern over ‘steady reduction’ of central funds to the State and ‘inordinate delay’ in their release.

The BJP called the letter a “political ploy to befool people” ahead of civic polls in the state.

In her letter, Banerjee asserted that despite the decline in central funds the state’s GSDP grew by 10.4 per cent against the national GDP growth of 5 per cent in 2019-20. “I write to you with deep concern regarding steady reduction of central funds to the state and also inordinate delay in release of funds to us from the Government of India,” Banerjee wrote.

She said the state is yet to receive its share of central funds totalling Rs 50,000 crore till January, 2020.

This “extradordinary situation” is creating major difficulties in meeting obligations for the welfare of the state, she said.

The letter said, “You will, no doubt, appreciate that both the central and the State Governments are expected to fulfil the constitutional obligations and the commitments to the people, so that respective governments run smoothly ... However West Bengal is being deprived of the huge outstanding dues.”

Banerjee said West Bengal’s index of industrial production (IIP) in April-November 2019-20 stood at 3.1 per cent against the national figure of 0.6 per cent, while growth of the services sector at 16.4 per cent was much higher than the national number of 6.9 percent.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mamata-writes-to-modi-about----steady-reduction----of-funds.html

The BJP also said the budget failed to fulfil the expectations of the people of the state.

Leader of Opposition in Rajasthan Assembly, Gulab Chand Kataria said the Ashok Gehlot-led government has burdened electricity consumers with `12,000 crore annually by increasing the power tariff. He added that the state had come into surplus in terms of revenue receipts in the previous dispensation led by the BJP.

“Power companies are reeling under losses. They have put an annual burden of `12,000 crore on people by increasing power tariff. There is no relief to people in the budget. We are not able to see any development in the budget,” Kataria said at a press conference.

The Congress government had recently announced the power tariff hike of 11.21 per cent.

Replying to a question on decreasing state share in tax collection from the Centre, Kataria said the State share in GST has increased concurrent with the income of the Centre.

He claimed the State Government was earning `21,000 crore through value-added tax (VAT), the highest in any state of the country, and despite that there was no word about development in the budget.

Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia said it was a routine Budget of the routine government and did not fulfil the expectations of the people of the State.

156,21-2-20,Nagpur grants bail to Devendra Fadnavis,"A Nagpur court on Thursday granted bail to Maharashtra’s former Chief Minister and leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly Devendra Fadnavis in a case seeking criminal proceedings against him non-disclosure of criminal cases registered against him in his 2014 election affidavit.

Fadnavis, who had been granted exemption from personal appearance on four previous occasions, finally appeared before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate PS Ingle amid tight security, and sought bail in the case.

After recording Fadnavis’ appearance before the court, the CJM granted him bail on a personal bond of Rs 15,000.

Fadnavis had been given last chance to appear before the court on Thursday. While granting bail to Fadnavis, the CJM observed: “The presence of the accused (Fadnavis) is secured. The offences are bailable. There is no apprehension of him absconding. Hence, bail is granted”.

The court was hearing an application filed by advocate Satish Uke, seeking criminal proceedings to be initiated against Fadnavis for alleged non-disclosure of criminal cases registered against him in his election affidavit in the 2014 Assembly elections.

The court, while granting bail, directed Fadnavis to remain present at the next hearing and also as and when directed by the court in the matter. The court has scheduled the next hearing for March 30.

Earlier, advocate Satish Uke opposed Fadnavis’ bail application on grounds that he had skipped earlier hearings on various grounds and citing the precedence of a similar case concerning Delhi Chief Minister Arvind

Kejriwal.

Uke had initially had moved a magisterial court which dismissed his complaint against Fadnavis on September 7, 2015. Subsequently, he moved a sessions court in Nagpur which transferred the matter to the magisterial court for a “de novo” (afresh) consideration.

Not happy with the Sessions court’s order, Fadnavis moved the Bombay High Court, which on May 3, 2018 set it aside.

Later, in its judgment on October 1, 2019, the apex court had set aside the Bombay High Court order which gave a clean chit to Fadnavis and held that he did not deserve to be tried for the alleged offence under the Representation of the People (RP) Act.

The SC order had come on an appeal filed by Uke, who had challenged the high court’s order.

In its October 1 2019 order, the Supreme Court had directed that a magistrate’s court in Nagpur district consider afresh the complaint filed by Uke, seeking criminal proceedings to be initiated against Mr Fadnavis under section 125-A of the RP Act.

The section 125-A of the RP Act, which deals with the penalty for “filing false affidavit”, says if a candidate or his proposer fails to furnish or gives false or conceals any information in his nomination paper on issues like pending criminal cases, then the person may be awarded six months jail term or fine or both.

Early this week, the Supreme Court reserved its verdict on Fadnavis’ plea seeking review of its 2019 judgment asking the BJP leader to face trial for allegedly failing to furnish details of two pending criminal cases against him in his 2014 poll affidavit.

While representing Fadnavis, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi had told a SC bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra that the issue would have very far reaching consequences for other candidates fighting elections and the apex court needed to re-examine its October 1, 2019 order.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nagpur-grants-bail-to-devendra-fadnavis.html

Though Uddhav had met Modi briefly on December 6 during the latter’s visit to Pune to attend a national conference of directors general and inspectors general of police, Friday’s will be — for all practical purposes — the first formal meeting between the two leaders, after the Shiv Sena snapped ties with the BJP and formed a government in Maharashtra in alliance with the NCP and Congress November 28.

Confirming Uddhav’s scheduled meeting with Modi on Friday, Shiv Sena’s MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut-- in a tweet posted on Thursday evening — described the meeting as “courtesy call”. He, however, declined to go into further details relating to the meeting.

Informed sources in the Shiv Sena, meanwhile, said that at Friday’s meeting, Uddhav would press for release of pending tax dues and also seek financial assistance from the Centre for the unseasonal rains hit farmers in the State.

It may be recalled that in a letter written to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on December 11 last year, Thackeray had sought the State’s “legitimate dues” of Rs 15,558 crore from the Union government by way of GST compensation and tax devolution.

“The State is awaiting legitimate dues of Rs 15,558.05 crore from the Government of India.... Timely release of GST compensation and tax devolution amount will help my state to manage the finances efficiently, “ the Chief Minister had written in his letter.

At that time, the pending dues comprised Rs 6,946.29 crore by way of tax devolution and Rs 8611.76 crore towards GST compensation up to November 2019.

“As per the Union budget 2019-20, the tax devolution to Maharashtra was Rs 46,630.66 crore which is 11.15 per cent more than Rs 41,952.65 crore received by the state during 2018-19.

But, the state has received only Rs 20,254.92 crore till October 2019 which is 25.53 per cent less compared to the budget estimate of 2019-20,” the Chief Minister had said in his letter to Sitaraman.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/uddhav-to-meet-modi-in-delhi-today.html

160,21-2-20,"Adani Gas gets PNGRB nod for demerger, stake sale to Total","The Adani family-owned Adani Gas has secured a nod from oil regulator for its demerger from its parent and the subsequent sale of a stake in the company to French energy giant Total SA after it made a formal application for the same, sources said.

The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) had threatened to cancel the 13 city gas distribution licences Adani Gas had won in the 9th bid round in 2018 for allegedly perpetrating a “fraud” by not disclosing material facts of the demerger.

After PNGRB slapped Adani Gas a showcause notice on Adani Gas Ltd (AGL) on November 29, 2019, the company maintained that “all concerned authorities were intimated about the proceedings pertaining reorganisation of AGL through media/ newspapers/ disclosures/ public listing/ bid submissions.”

But, with PNGRB threatening to seek an investigation by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs into the “fraud”, impose a Rs 396.81 crore penalty and cancel licences for all 13 areas that it had won, the company made a formal application for the stake sale. The sources said subsequent to that, PNGRB processed the application and gave its approval. PNGRB, however, has told the company that it should have sought approval of the stake sale in time. A company spokesperson was not immediately available for comments.

Originally, Adani Gas was part of Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) and was demerged into a separate unit before half of Adani family’s 74.8 per cent stake being sold to Total.

PNGRB had in its November notice stated that the AGL at the time of submission of bids in the 9th city gas distribution bid round in July 2018 was “already in the process of undertaking the implementation of a ‘Composite Scheme of Amalgamation and Demerger’” and was fully aware that this would “result in the change in promoter of AGL from AEL to two discretionary family trusts”. AGL submitted bids using the net worth of AEL to meet the bidding criteria and non-disclosure of the change of ownership was a “fraud”, it had contended.

In October 2018, the Adani group agreed to form a 50:50 joint venture with Total for retailing CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households. A year later, Total signed up to buy 37.4 per cent stake in Adani Gas for around Rs 5,700 crore. When the news of the PNGRB notice first broke last month, Adani Gas had stated that it has “duly responded to PNGRB with all required informations to close the matter”.

“Our project work at all GAs (geographical areas) are going on in full swing and with the facilitation and support of PNGRB and all authorities, we are committed to deliver CNG and piped gas to millions of our consumers on a fast track basis. “We are guided by the principles of corporate governance. It should be noted that we are fully compliant and have transparently represented facts in totality adhering to norms of compliance and disclosure,” the Adani Gas spokesperson had added.

The spokesperson also said that there is no question of penalties as the same are not applicable and moreover Adani Gas is in full compliance of applicable rules/laws. Adani Gas has already set up city gas distribution operations in Ahmedabad and Vadodara in Gujarat, Faridabad in Haryana and Khurja in Uttar Pradesh. It in joint venture with Indian Oil Corp (IOC) is also developing distribution networks in Allahabad, Chandigarh, Ernakulam, Panipat, Daman, Dharwad, and Udhamsingh Nagar.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/adani-gas-gets-pngrb-nod-for-demerger--stake-sale-to-total.html

163,21-2-20,Fitch Ratings takes Bharti Airtel off ‘watch negative’,"Fitch Ratings on Thursday said it has taken Bharti Airtel off ‘watch negative’ and affirmed the telecom operator’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating at ‘BBB-’ with a stable outlook. “The Stable Outlook reflects our view that an equity injection of USD 2 billion in January 2020 and EBITDA growth for the financial year ending March 2020 (FY20) and FY21 will be more than sufficient to offset the increase in debt to pay regulatory dues of up to USD 4.9 billion, which stem from a dispute over adjusted gross revenue (AGR),” the rating agency said in a statement.

Bharti paid Rs 10,000 crore on February 17 to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) after the Supreme Court rejected telcos’ petition to ascertain with the DoT the amount and timing of payment of regulatory dues related to the AGR dispute. “Bharti’s management estimates the regulatory dues will not exceed the provision amount of USD 4.9 billion,” it said. The Supreme Court’s original ruling in October led the DoT to seek hefty unpaid dues on licence fees and spectrum-usage charges from telcos. The DoT demand relates to a 14-year-old dispute regarding the definition of AGR, which the Supreme Court agreed should include all kinds of income generated by the telcos. “The Rating Watch Negative is removed from all the ratings,” Fitch said. It estimated that funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage will improve to 2.3-2.4 times in FY20 and to around 2.0x in FY21 - excluding USD 6.3 billion in deferred spectrum costs - below 2.5 times, the threshold above which it may consider negative rating action.

The USD 2 billion (over Rs 14,000 crore) equity injection alleviated pressure on the balance sheet resulting from high regulatory dues obligations and the company says it is committed to an investment-grade rating. It raised about USD 7.6 billion in equity through a rights issue and the sale of equity in its African subsidiary, Airtel Africa Plc, in last 18 months. “We estimate Bharti’s consolidated EBITDA will increase by 20-25 per cent a year in FY20 and FY21 due to easing competition in the Indian wireless market and continued strong growth in its African markets and Indian enterprise segment,” Fitch said. The rating agency said Bharti is poised to gain at least 30 million subscribers from Vodafone Idea in FY21. “We believe that Bharti and Jio will gain market share, given Vodafone Idea has limited financial flexibility to raise at least USD 6 billion in debt to pay regulatory dues in the short term,” it said.

Vodafone Idea is struggling to improve its EBITDA amid a rapidly shrinking subscriber base and significantly high leverage. The company’s chairman publicly stated that it may shut down if it does not receive any relief on regulatory dues from the Supreme Court.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fitch-ratings-takes-bharti-airtel-off----watch-negative---.html

165,21-2-20,"Govt may seek balance between SC order, telcos’ health","With the telecom sector reeling under severe financial stress and Vodafone Idea staring at bankruptcy in case it is made to pay its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, the Government is considering options to stick to the Supreme Court’s directive but with least possible impact on the financials of the stressed operators.

According to people in the know, the Government will try to ensure that its action regarding AGR dues takes care of all the perspectives, firstly, compliance with the Supreme Court’s order, then, ensuring minimum impact on the health of the telcos along with making sure that the consumers are not impacted adversely.

The Government, among other options, is considering to set up a fund to facilitate operations of telcos post the payment of their AGR dues, sources said.

According to sources in the know, the dues which have to be paid to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) would have to be put in the telecom fund, and can then be lent to the companies at lower interest.

This will allow companies to maintain their going concern status and continue operations without running to banks to raise funds.

With the sector in trouble, none of the banks would be ready to lend to telcos, so the fund would act as critical funding support. The telecom fund is likely to help telcos manage their cash flows and would be fiscally neutral for the Government.

The sources also said that two other options are being looked at — waiver of penalties or staggered payments with interest. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and the Law and Finance Ministries would take the final call.

The DoT has maintained that it will execute the top court’s directive and stick to the spirit of the order.

In the last couple of days, chiefs of telecom majors, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have met Government officials and Ministers in a bid to get some relief.

On Wednesday, Mittal and Vodafone Idea Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla met Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to apprise her the current stressed state of affairs in the telecom sector due to huge AGR payment and are learnt to have sought relief for sustenance.

175,21-2-20,"AGR unprecedented crisis, sought cut in taxes for industry: Mittal","Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal on Thursday met Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in the wake of the current AGR payment to be made by the telcos, saying he suggested that for the overall health of the industry, taxes needed to be brought down.

Mittal, however, said the issue of AGR payment per se did not figure in the talks. The discussion was on the overall industry, he said.

“Adjusted Gross Revenue has been an unprecedented crisis for the telecom industry. I made certain suggestions on the overall health of the industry. Industry has been heavily taxed and taxes need to be looked at. The issue of very low revenues left in the kitty of the industry needs to be addressed and the AGR also need to be dealt with”, he said after the meeting with Prasad.

He said Airtel will make the balance payment expeditiously .”The demand for reduction in taxation for the telecom sector has been for a long time. The regulator has been supporting it”, he said in response to a query if he has sought any cut in levies.

Mittal met the minister amid reports that said government was looking at some form of relief for the sector in view of huge AGR dues to be paid by telcos.

The telcos, particularly Vodafone Idea, which is severely hit by the AGR payment, has sought a bailout. The options here before the government are limited. There could be a cut in licence fee and spectrum usage charges, staggered payment of AGR over long years with interests, a waiver of interest and penalties on AGR dues.

So far the Government has neither stated nor indicated any relief for the telcos. On Wednesday, Mittal met Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and sought sustainability for telcos in the stressful times. He had said Indian telecom industry has been under stress for the last three-and-a-half years and the Government should ensure sustainability of the sector.

176,21-2-20,Trump urged to push for favourable pulse crop provision in trade deal with India,"Two US Senators have urged President Donald Trump to ""push for favourable pulse crop provisions"" in any trade deal the United States signs with India.

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are scheduled to travel to Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi on February 24 and 25. There have been talks about India and the United States agreeing on a trade package as a precursor to a major trade deal.

""As you prepare for your upcoming trip to India, we write to encourage you to push for favourable pulse crop provisions in any deal the United States may sign with the Republic of India,"" two Republican Senators Kevin Cramer and Steve Daines wrote in a letter to Trump.

Daines represents the state of Montana, while Cramer is from North Dakota. Both Montana and North Dakota are major pulse producing states.

In their letter dated February 19, the two Senators said Montana and North Dakota are the top two producers of pulses in the United States and India is the world's largest consumer of pulse crops, contributing to approximately 27 per cent of the world's consumption.

The most commonly consumed pulse crops in India are lentils, chickpeas, dried beans, and peas, yet the Republic of India has levied substantial tariffs on American pulse crops.

""Unfair Indian tariffs on pulse crops have substantially harmed our producers back home,"" they wrote.

""Following the removal of lndia from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) on June 5, 2019, additional tariffs were placed on American pulse crops. Currently, tariff rates are 30 per cent for dried beans, 50 per cent for lentils and peas, and 70 per cent for chickpeas. As a result, US pulse crop producers face a significant competitive disadvantage when exporting to India,"" the two Senators wrote to Trump.

""At a time when many producers have been struggling to make ends meet, your work to expand market opportunities for US farm commodities has been critical. Engaging Prime Minister Modi on pulse crop tariffs as part of larger discussions to enhance the economic cooperation between our countries would be mutually beneficial to both American producers and Indian consumers,"" Cramer and Daines wrote.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-urged-to-push-for-favourable-pulse-crop-provision-in-trade-deal-with-india-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/trump-urged-to-push-for-favourable-pulse-crop-provision-in-trade-deal-with-india.html
177,21-2-20,9 killed in ‘far-right’ attack in Germany,"A 43-year-old German man shot and killed nine people at several locations in a Frankfurt suburb overnight in attacks that appear to have been motivated by far-right beliefs, officials said Thursday.

The gunman first attacked a hookah bar in central Hanau at about 10 p.M. Wednesday, killing several people before heading about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) west and opening fire again, claiming more victims.

Witnesses and surveillance videos of the suspect’s getaway car led authorities quickly to his home, near the scene of the second attack, where he was found dead near his 72-year-old mother, said Peter Beuth, the interior minister for the state of Hesse.

A website believed to be the suspect’s is being evaluated, Beuth said.

“Initial analysis of the webpage of the suspect indicate a xenophobic motivation,” he said. He said federal prosecutors have taken over the investigation of the crime and are treating it as an act of domestic terrorism.

“This is an attack on our free and peaceful society,” he said. Some of the victims are believed to be Turkish, and Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the consulate in Frankfurt and the embassy in Berlin were trying to obtain information on the attack.

“According to the initial information, it was an attack with a racist motive, but we would need to wait for the (official) statement,” he told state television TRT.

German news agency dpa reported that police are examining a video the suspect may have posted online several days earlier in which he details a conspiracy theory about child abuse in the United States. The authenticity of the video couldn’t immediately be verified.

On a website registered by someone with the same name as the man in the video, Tobias R., the owner says he was born in Hanau in 1977 and grew up in the city, later training with a bank and completing a business degree in 2007.

The attack comes amid growing concerns about far-right violence in Germany.

Chancellor Angela Merkel called off a planned visit Thursday to a university in Halle.

Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she was “being constantly kept abreast of the state of the investigations in Hanau.” Halle was the site of a deadly anti-Semitic attack last year.

179,21-2-20,Merkel slams ‘poison’ of racism,"Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the “poison” of racism on Thursday after a shooter with suspected far-right beliefs killed nine people at a shisha bar and a cafe in the German city of Hanau.

The suspect, identified as 43-year-old German Tobias R., was found dead at his home following an hours-long manhunt.

The body of his 72-year-old mother was also found at the flat in what appeared to be a murder-suicide.

Federal counter-terror prosecutors investigating the case said they saw “a xenophobic motive” behind the shootings, the latest deadly attack blamed on the far right in Germany.

“Racism is a poison, hatred is a poison and this poison exists in our society and it is already to blame for far too many crimes,” Merkel said in Berlin.

The suspect left behind online a “manifesto” and video material that suggested a terror attack motivated by “a hostile attitude to foreigners”, said Peter Beuth, the interior minister of the state of Hesse.

Among the dead were “several victims of Kurdish origin”, the Kon-Med association of Kurds in Germany said in a statement, adding that it was “furious” that authorities weren’t doing more to combat rising extremism.

183,21-2-20,Rs slides 10 paise to over 1-month low of 71.64 against $,"The rupee on Thursday declined by 10 paise to settle at a more than one-month low of 71.64 against the US dollar amid heavy selling in domestic equities and strengthening of the American currency in the overseas market.

Forex traders said investor sentiments remained fragile amid coronavirus fears and sustained foreign fund outflows. The death toll from the coronavirus epidemic in China has climbed to 2,118, while the overall confirmed cases increased to 74,576, Chinese officials said on Thursday.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at 71.75. During the day, it lost ground and touched a low of 71.80 and finally settled 10 paise lower at 71.64 against the US currency, a level not seen since January 8. The rupee had settled at 71.54 against the US dollar on Tuesday. Forex market was shut on February 19, on account of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti.

“Indian rupee recovered early morning losses following Asian peers. Foreign fund inflows, dollar selling by state owned banks and stable crude oil prices also supported the rupee,” said V K Sharma, Head PCG and Capital Markets Strategy, HDFC Securities.

Sharma added the near-term bias for rupee is bearish amid stronger dollar vis-a-vis major trading currencies. On a weekly basis, the rupee lost 33 paise. “Despite a lackluster week, we saw an appreciation in USD/INR spot tracking some uncertainty over coronavirus along with sharp surge in dollar index and crude oil prices,” said Rahul Gupta, Head of Research- Currency, Emkay Global Financial Services.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/rs---slides-10-paise-to-over-1-month-low-of-71-64-against--.html
184,21-2-20,Round-the-clock power supply by bundling renewable with thermal power: Draft policy,"The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has proposed a draft policy for the supply of round-the-clock (RTC) power to distributors through a mix of renewable energy and electricity generated in coal-based plants.

Addressing the issues of intermittency, limited hours of supply and low capacity utilisation of transmission infrastructure, the draft policy provides for reverse bundling, wherein high-cost thermal power is being allowed to be bundled with cheaper renewable energy.

Accordingly, a power generating firm will have to supply electricity such that at least 51 per cent of the annual energy supplied corresponds to renewable energy and the balance is drawn from thermal sources.

The generator will supply RE power complemented with thermal power, in RTC manner, keeping at least 80 per cent availability on an annual basis, the draft said.

“The main objective of the scheme is to provide RTC power to the discoms through bundling of RE power with thermal power and to scale up renewable capacity additions. It will also facilitate fulfilment of renewable purchase obligation (RPO) requirement of the obligated entities,” the ministry said inviting comments from stakeholders on the new policy.

While India is committed to installing 175 GW of renewable energy (RE) sources by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030, intermittent power generated through such sources and its implication on the grid safety has been a concern. Parallelly, there is around 26 GW of stranded thermal power assets lying unutilised which can provide firm power to the grid.

To bridge the gap, the MNRE has come out with the draft RE-based round the clock (RTC) power.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/round-the-clock-power-supply-by-bundling-renewable-with-thermal-power--draft-policy.html

The policy would help alleviate housing shortage in urban areas by encouraging renting of homes as millions of houses lie vacant across the country.

“Very soon you will see a rental policy out,” he said here at a function. The Minister said that a lot of people do not want to give their properties on rent because they think that “if you have a weak legal system, you might not get your property back”. He expressed hope that the new policy will overcome this concern. “You have got the template etc (of the policy). States can tweak it to the extent they like.

186,21-2-20,Economic activity remains weak: RBI rate setting panel minutes,"Economic activity remains weak and high frequency indicators do not point to “bottoming out” of the downturn, the RBI Monetary Policy Committee noted while keeping the key interest rate unchanged earlier this month.

According to the minutes of the MPC released by the central bank on Thursday, member and RBI Deputy Governor Michael Debabrata Patra observed that economic activity remains weak.

“... There are indications of the momentum of growth stabilising, with sector-specific upticks underlying this guarded optimism, but they are far from gaining economy-wide traction. In some sectors, the slowdown is deep, and activity is stalled by sizable slack in demand.

“High frequency indicators are not offering definitive evidence yet that the downturn is bottoming out,” he said during the meeting of the MPC that concluded on February 6.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, who heads the six-member panel, said “some green shoots are, however, visible”. India’s economic growth is estimated to have slowed down to 11-year low of 5 per cent during the current financial year ending March 2020.

This compensation was to come out of a pool that is to be created by levy of cess on certain sin and luxury goods over and above the GST tax rate.

189,21-2-20,Trump ousts top defence official who certified Ukraine aid,"President Donald Trump has ousted the Pentagon’s top policy official who had certified last year that Ukraine had made enough anti-corruption progress to justify the Trump administration’s release of congressionally authorised aid to Kyiv in its conflict against Russian-backed separatists.

John Rood resigned Wednesday, saying he was leaving at Trump’s request.

The Trump administration’s delay in releasing the aid to Ukraine was central to the president’s impeachment by the House on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

The Senate voted to acquit the president. But in the wake of the Senate trial, an emboldened Trump has gone after officials he has perceived as being disloyal.

Rood is the latest official to be purged. His forced resignation comes as Democrats on the Hill express concerns that Trump is on a vendetta in the wake of his acquittal.

Just days after the Senate vote, the White House reassigned an Army officer, Lt. Col. Alex Vindman, a key witness in the impeachment inquiry, from the National Security Council, and pushed his twin brother, an NSC lawyer, out with him.

Gordon Sondland, Trump’s ambassador to the European Union who also was a key witness before House investigators, was recalled from his post.

Trump tweeted Wednesday that he wanted to “thank John Rood for his service to our Country, and wish him well in his future endeavors!” Rood, in his letter to Trump, did not mention Ukraine.

It’s my understanding from Secretary (Mark) Esper that you requested my resignation,” Rood said. Rood said he will step down as of February 28.

Rood wrote in a May 23 letter to Congress that the Pentagon had made a thorough assessment of Ukraine’s anti-corruption actions and other reforms.

And he said that, “I have certified that the government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purpose of decreasing corruption” and making other improvements.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-ousts-top-defence-official-who-certified-ukraine-aid.html

Actor Taapsee Pannu, who recently won the Filmfare Critics’ Choice Award for Best Actor (Female), has reacted on the controversy that the awards ceremony has generated this year, over Zoya Akhtar’s Gully Boy sweeping most of the awards.

She said she is happy that her name wasn’t dragged in the controversy as I am so used to it. And that she is glad that critics felt she was worthy of an award.

“It took time but finally I got it and what should I say other than that? I was preparing my speech for it since 2016 and it was of no use. But this year I didn’t prepare a speech and that day I had to deliver it, Taapsee said.

‘Happy birthday Patralekhaa. I still remember seeing you in an advertisement and wondering I wish I could meet this girl one day. And as destiny would have it, much to my desire, I met you a month later. It has been so many years of togetherness yet it feels like we've just met. You are the prettiest and the strongest girl I've met.’ —Rajkummar Rao

Badlapur, an action-thriller, has completed five years since it was released, and its actress Radhika Apte is super nostalgic.

Reminiscing about working with Sriram Raghavan, who helmed the film, Radhika said, “I think Sriram has a very peculiar eye about thrillers like no one else does, he is one of the most passionate people I have met, I mean he watches cinema, everything that is made available to him.”

The film featured Varun Dhawan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui in the lead roles.

Jennifer returns to acting after marriage

Actor Jennifer Lawrence is all set to return to the screen for the first time after marriage last year. She has taken up a role in director Adam McKay’s forthcoming Netflix comedy titled Don’t Look Up.

The Oscar-winning actress wed Cooke Maroney last year. Her new film follows two scientists who discover a meteor that is set to strike Earth in six months’ time and attempts to warn the rest of the world.

“She’s what folks in the 17th century used to call ‘a dynamite act’. And the fact that Netflix sees this film as a worldwide comedy sets the bar high for me and my team in an exciting and motivating way,” McKay said.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-02-21.html
191,21-2-20,Ayushmann and I are connected: Vicky,"Actor Vicky Kaushal returns to the screens for the first time since his National Award-winning blockbuster Uri: The Surgical Strike with his new release, Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship. At the box-office the film clashes with Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, starring Ayushmann Khurrana, with whom he shared the National Award. Ayushmann received the honour for his role in Andhadhun.

“I think Ayushmann and I are connected somewhere. We were together on Koffee With Karan and we have hosted an awards show together as well. After that, we shared the National Award (Best Actor) and now, our films are releasing on the same day!” said Vicky.

About the clash, he added, “It is impractical that you will get a solo release because we make a lot more film than the Fridays that we have, so clashes (of films) are bound to happen.” Vicky’s next after this is the Karan Johar-directorial Takht. He will start shooting for the historical drama in March.

Takht is a big-budget period drama that casts Ranveer Singh as Dara Shukoh and Vicky as Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. The film is scheduled for a Christmas weekend release in 2021 and it also stars Kareena Kapoor Khan, Alia Bhatt, Anil Kapoor, Janhvi Kapoor and Bhumi Pednekar.

Asked if he feels the pressure being a part of such a big-budget film, Vicky said, “I don’t feel much pressure but I am excited because it was on my bucket list to do a period film. I will start preparing for it immediately after release of Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship.”

The recent Filmfare Awards in Guwahati ignited widespread fan ire over Zoya Akhtar’s Gully Boy bagging the maximum number of awards. Talking about the controversy, Vicky said, “It’s not the first year where this kind of a controversy has taken place. They (award ceremonies) have their jury to decide winners. I don’t know what goes behind it. We (actors) are also like the audience who go there to enjoy the award ceremonies. If we are announced winners then we receive it (the award) otherwise we just enjoy the night. So, I don’t know anything about it, but I believe there is jury who takes that decision. So, we should leave it to them.”

192,21-2-20,"Sharing food, conversation and laughter","Stephanie Alexander, an Australian food educator, feels that it is very important to concentrate on the enjoyable aspect of cooking and not just skills. By Team Viva

Sharing food and wine with family and friends is very important for her. Brushing past scented leaves in a garden, picking parsley outside the back door, pulling a cork from a bottle of wine, setting out a picnic on a bush table — all these things push her to live another day and eat another meal. Stephanie Alexander, an Australian food educator, believes that there is no greater joy than sharing food, conversation and laughter around a table.

You emphasise more on joyful and healthy cooking. Do you think people nowadays are more aware of fresh and organic ways of cooking?

Yes, I think it is very important to concentrate on the enjoyable aspect of cooking. We also need to make sure that young people, who are in the process of learning the skills of cooking, not only get efficient in that but also understand how important it is to enjoy the process. For me, cooking is one of the most wonderful things to bring a family or group of people together. So I spend a lot of time trying to encourage people to enjoy their food choices.

I choose organic food only. The organic movement is growing everywhere, as more and more people are becoming aware of their food choices. We have great emphasis on fish too.

Melbourne is known as Australia’s food capital. What reasons would you attribute that to?

I am very proud of Melbourne as it is a great food destination. Though we are a country of just three million, there are a lot of things we can do. We have a range of cafes and restaurants catering to every need. Some of the reasons for its popularity are: The Queen Victoria Market, fish food, Wagyu beef tartars and chilli baked mussels.

What do you have to say about the current food culture of Melbourne? What does it have in store for Indians specifically?

There are no special food trends there. You can have good food everywhere in Melbourne, not only in the city but even in the vineyard or sea side. Wherever you go, you will find one commonality fish.

One in every third person in Melbourne is born elsewhere or there parents were. So we have all kinds of ethnic foods you can imagine. The population there has a huge choice. So any visitor, Indian or otherwise, can choose what they would like to eat. There is nothing specific.

What is your signature dish and how did you come up with it?

I don’t think I have a signature dish. I only have certain things which I cook all the time. One of them is roast chicken, my children are very fond of it. My speciality is garlic chicken and potatoes and lemon garlic chicken. It tastes delicious. I always like to serve a dish with green salads. Even choosing a favourite dish is very hard for me. I really like lamb cutlet and fresh fish.

What are the new global food movements?

Now more and more restaurants are interested in using indigenous ingredients. If you go into a good restaurant in Melbourne, you will find ingredients that you have never heard of such as fingerlions. As the name suggests, it is the size of your finger and are grown on very small trees in the rain forest.

You are the author of 17 cookbooks. Are there any more on their way? If so, what will you focus on?

Yes, I am writing a book on home cooking. It will cater to the family cooking basically. However, it will take a year for it to come out.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sharing-food--conversation-and-laughter-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/sharing-food--conversation-and-laughter.html
193,21-2-20,Gifts for young chefs,"From kitchen tools to books, here are some amazing gifts to encourage fledgling cooks

Do you have a kid in your life who loves a good baking session? Who really wants to use your chef’s knife? Who is addicted to the TV show MasterChef Junior, and who uses words like “umami” in regular conversation?

There are many terrific gifts to encourage the fledgling cooks in our lives.

COOKING KITS

An all-inclusive cooking kit (besides the ingredients) is often a great catalyst for getting kids into the kitchen.

Handstand Kitchen makes a slew of them, including a Rainbows and Unicorns Ultimate Baking set, with cookies cutters, unicorn-shaped cupcake tray, spatula, frosting bag with three tips, and a recipe leaflet and sticker sheet. Other offerings here include the Out of This World space-themed baking kit; a 17-piece Intro to Baking kit; and several matching adult and child apron sets.

Curious chef’s kits include a 17-piece prep set with bowls, measuring cups and spoons, and a timer. Made for Me has kits for particular foods, such as a beginner’s pasta and pizza making set for kids, as well as a macaron, sushi and pancake party set.

SUBSCRIPTIONS

Here’s a gift that leaves something to look forward to after the holidays are over. Options include:

Young chef’s club: From the folks at America’s Test Kitchen, these monthly kits are also thematic. Kids ages 5 and up receive a box filled with family-friendly recipes, hands-on activities, and extras ranging from board games to tortilla warmers to special sprinkles.

Culinary adventure society: For kids who already know their way around a kitchen and are craving new ingredients and flavours to play with. Up to four times a year, Zingerman’s specialty food store in Ann Arbor, Michigan, will send a big box of eight to 10 interesting and on-trend food surprises. A box might contain maffe, a peanut simmer sauce from West Africa; Lisbon lemon marmalade; or a tamarind date sauce inspired by Somali cuisine, for example. A collection of writing on the foods’ history and culture is included.

EQUIPMENT

A new smart kitchen tool is exciting, even empowering. Examples:

Immersion blender: For a slightly older kid, it can be used to blend things like soups and sauces right in the pot. That save you from having to transfer hot liquids into a regular blender or food processor, so it can be a safer way to puree things. Breville makes an All in One Immersion Blender that also transforms into a food processor, so kids can take on different levels of chopping as they get more skilled.

Cutting boards: Giving kids their own cutting board makes them feel as though they’ve arrived. You can support Unicef.com by ordering one of many hand-carved boards, such as the teakwood Daily Grain from Guatemala, or the Beautiful Meal board from Thailand. Or memorialise a family recipe for a child on a cutting board: Carver’s Ridge lets you send in a recipe, choose a font and board size, and have your recipe engraved into a fully functional work board.

INGREDIENT ‘FLIGHTS’

It’s fun to play around with a single ingredient in many forms.

Olive Oil and Vinegar: The worlds of olive oil and vinegar are both vast. For starters, you can make new and different salad dressings all week long. O-Med, a small company from Grenada, makes lots of varieties, including smoked olive oil, yuzu olive oil and olive oil from Arbequina olives. Encourage the kids to mix and match those with cabernet vinegar, rose vinegar and cava vinegar. Your family’s vinaigrettes with never be the same.

Honey: Bee Raw Honey has a beautiful nine-vial assortment of honeys ranging from floral and sweet to buttery to “barnyard.” The honey comes from different flower sources across the country, and sales help support artisanal beekeepers.

Books

Lots of kid-friendly cookbooks and food books out there, for all ages. A few to check out this holiday season:

From America’s Test Kitchen, The Complete Cookbook for Young Chefs and The Complete Baking Book for Young Chefs. All recipes are kid-tested. The little chef hat symbols let you know how much experience is needed for each recipe.

Notes from a Young Black Chef (Knopf, 2019): Award-winning, 29-year old executive chef Kwame Onwuachi was raised in New York City, Nigeria and Louisiana. He started cooking at a young age under his mother’s direction, and tells an intense story of moving up through kitchens both gritty and elite. This memoir centers on the experience of being a minority in the culinary world, and finding a place in the sphere of fine dining. —AP",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gifts-for-young-chefs-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/gifts-for-young-chefs.html
194,21-2-20,No bright side for Spurs,"Jose Mourinho fears his side’s season is running out of gas after an injury-hit Spurs slumped to a 1-0 defeat at home to RB Leipzig in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie.

Spurs could be without the talismanic duo of Harry Kane and Son Heung-min for the rest of the season through injury and looked toothless against the Bundesliga contenders.

“We are in a very difficult situation,” said Mourinho. “What worries me is this is going to be the situation until the end of the season.”

Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris kept his side in the tie with a string of important saves, but he could not prevent Timo Werner from the penalty spot as the German international’s 26th goal of the season gave Leipzig a lead to defend on home soil on March 10.

“Over the 90 minutes we deserved the win and could have won by more,” said Leipzig boss Julian Nagelsmann.

195,21-2-20,Atalanta’s night to ‘remember forever’,"Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini hailed a performance his club will “remember forever” after the Italian side crushed Valencia 4-1 on Wednesday to take a giant step closer to reaching the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time.

Dutch wing-back Hans Hateboer scored twice on 16 and 62 minutes, sandwiching goals from Josip Ilicic and Remo Freuler.

“This is an evening that we’ll remember forever,” said Gasperini. “It’s an amazing result, full of emotion.”

It was an extraordinary night for the side from Bergamo who travelled to the San Siro with over 40,000 of their fans as their home stadium 55km away does not meet UEFA regulations. Denis Cheryshev pulled one back for Valencia in the first leg of the last-16 tie at the San Siro, the same stadium where the Spanish side lost the 2001 final to Bayern Munich on penalties.

Valencia, seventh in La Liga, had finished top of their group after away wins over Ajax and Chelsea but were missing several key players through injury and suspension.

“It certainly complicates things a bit, it’s a pretty overwhelming result, this 4-1,” said Valencia coach Albert Celades.

“In the end it doesn’t reflect much what we saw on the pitch.”

Atalanta’s run comes despite losing their opening three Champions League group games, before finishing second behind Manchester City.

“Three goals ahead is a nice reward,” added Gasperini. “But there were a lot of dangerous situations, these are things we’ll need to improve in Valencia.

“We are satisfied with this victory and above all with this advantage.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/atalanta---s-night-to----remember-forever---.html
196,21-2-20,Indian women dominate with 3 Gold,"On a fruitful day for India in women’s competition of Asian Wrestling Championship at Indira Gandhi stadium here on Thursday, three female wrestlers — Pinki Rani (55 kg), Sarita Mor (59 kg) and Divya Kakran (68 kg) won Gold medals in the freestyle event. While Nirmala Devi (50kg) settles for Silver in the 50kg category after losing final against Japan’s Migo Igarashi.

2018 Commonwealth and Asian Games Bronze medallist Divya was the star performer for the hosts on the opening day of freestyle event as she produced a strong performance by winning all her bouts, including against reigning junior world champion Naruha Matsuyuki in the fourth round.

She started the day by routing Kazakhstan’s Albina Kairgelinova and then knocked out Mongolia’s Delgermaa Enkkhsaikhan.

In the third round, against Uzbekistan’s Azoda Esbergenova, she led 4-0 with consecutive rolls and then pinned her opponent to finish it off in just 27 seconds.

Against the Japanese junior world champion, with her strong left-leg attacks, Divya led 4-0 with a takedown and an expose move.

The Japanese made a solid start in the second period as she attacked the Indian’s left leg initially but scored points with a right leg move to make it 4-4.

The Japanese almost pinned her but Divya wriggled out of the difficult position. She soon effected a move which led to her victory by fall.

“I had to win by fall to get five points from all my bouts because the Japanese was winning all her bouts by big margins, so I took a risk for big wins. My coach had said that I don’t have to go for big throws all the time, but I went for it,” said Divya.

“It did become tricky after I led 4-0 (in final). I was not in a great position (Naruha’s lock) and it could have been very dangerous. But I took a risk and it paid off by God’s grace.”

Asked if the absence of Chinese wrestler helped, she replied in the affirmative.

“Yes, it did benefit. But if you have a five-wrestler group it becomes even tougher, you have to fight everyone and win big. I won 4 bouts within 2 hours. It was tough on the body but the good thing is I have improved on my range, I made all kinds of attacks, Irani, Kheme, single-led, double leg attacks.”

Sarita, competing in her first Asian event since winning a Silver in 2017 in 58kg, won her first two bouts by technical superiority against Madina Bakbergenova (Kazakhstan) and Nazira MarsbekKyzy (Kyrgyzstan) before winning 10-3 against Japan’s Yuumi Kon.

She edged out Mongolia’s Battseteg Atlantsetseg 3-2 in the final. Sarita managed a push-out point to win her first Gold at this event after the scores were tied.

Pinki, competing at senior Asian for the first time, began by beating Uzbekistan’s Shokida Akhmedova by fall but lost the next bout to Japan’s Kana Higashikawa.

She won her semifinal against Marina Zuyeva 6-0 and beat Mongolia’s Dulguun Bolormaa 2-1 to grab the Gold. All the points scored in the final were on passivity.

“I was a bit careful because I had injured my elbow. I did not want to aggravate since important events are lined up,” said Pinki.

Nirmala beat Mongolia’s Munkhnar Byambasuren 6-4 and Uzbeskitan’s Dauletbike Yakhshimuratova by technical superiority but lost the final 2-3 to Japan’s Miho Igarashi.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-women-dominate-with-3-gold.html
197,21-2-20,"Bloomberg, Sanders under attack at Dems’ Nevada debate","From the opening bell, Democrats unleashed an aggressive verbal assault on New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg and raised new questions about Bernie Sanders’ take-no-prisoners politics in a contentious debate Wednesday night that threatened to scramble even further the party’s urgent quest to defeat President Donald Trump.

The former New York City mayor was forced to defend his divisive record on race, gender and Wall Street in his debate-stage debut, while Sanders, appearing in his ninth of the 2020 primary season, tried to beat back pointed questions about his healthand his embrace of democratic socialism.

Fierce exchanges throughout the two-hour affair marked the most aggressive sustained period of infighting in the Democrats’ yearlong search for a presidential nominee, reflecting rising urgency in a 2020 primary season that is already deep into its voting phase.

Nevada votes Saturday. South Carolina the week after. And more than a dozen states host a series of Super Tuesday contests in less than two weeks.

In a fight for her political life, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was a leading aggressor against Bloomberg. She was on the attack throughout the night followinga sharp slide in the polls, calling Bloomberg “a billionaire who calls people fat broads and horse-faced lesbians.” She wasn’t alone.

Sanders lashed out at Bloomberg’s policing policies as New York City mayor that he said targeted “African-American and Latinos in an outrageous way.” And former Vice President Joe Biden charged that Bloomberg’s “stop-and-frisk” policy ended up “throwing 5 million black men up against the wall.” Bloomberg defended himself on all counts and took a shot at Sanders’ electability: “I don’t think there’s any chance of the senator beating Donald Trump.” Bloomberg later seized on Sanders’ rising wealth: “The best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses!” Sanders defended owning multiple houses, noting he has one in Washington, where he works, and two in Vermont.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/bloomberg--sanders-under-attack-at-dems----nevada-debate.html

201,21-2-20,19 children among dead in recent Yemen strikes: UN,"Nineteen children were among at least 31 civilians killed in air strikes on rebel-held northern Yemen last week, the United Nations said on Thursday.

“UNICEF is sad to confirm that the recent attack in Al-Jawf, north of Yemen, on February 15, took the lives of 19 children (eight boys and 11 girls) and injured another 18 (nine boys and another nine girls),” the UN children’s agency said in a statement.

“It was an attack on a civilian populated area where children were in the vicinity,” UNICEF regional communications chief Juliette Touma told AFP. Saturday’s air strikes came after the Iran-aligned rebels claimed to have shot down an aircraft of the Saudi-led coalition supporting the government. The rebels reported multiple coalition air strikes where the plane went down, while the coalition conceded the “possibility of collateral damage” during a “search and rescue operation” at the site of the jet crash, which left the fate of its crew uncertain.

UNICEF urged the warring sides to put an end to the conflict, adding that the “worrying escalation of violence over the past few weeks is a harsh reminder that children in Yemen continue to carry the heaviest burden of the conflict”.

The Saudi-led coalition intervened in the war in 2015, shortly after the rebels seized control of the capital Sanaa.

Since then, tens of thousands of people — mostly civilians — have been killed and many more displaced in what the UN has called the worst humanitarian crisis.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/19-children-among-dead-in-recent-yemen-strikes--un.html
202,21-2-20,"Rare Ethiopian crown, hidden for 21 yrs in the Netherlands, returns home","Ethiopia’s government on Thursday assumed custody of a priceless 18th-century crown that a former refugee had kept hidden in his apartment in the Netherlands for two decades.

The handover took place at a ceremony in the capital, Addis Ababa, attended by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch minister for foreign trade and development cooperation.

Sirak Asfaw, the one-time refugee who is now a Dutch citizen, fled Ethiopia during the late 1970s during the so-called “Red Terror” purges.

He found the gilded crown — which features images of Christ and the Twelve Apostles — in 1998 in a suitcase left behind by a visitor.

It had “disappeared” from the Holy Trinity Church in Cheleqot, a village in northern Ethiopia, the Dutch government said in a statement Thursday.

Sirak assumed the crown had been stolen but worried it would “just disappear again” if he returned it to Ethiopia’s leaders, so he kept it in his apartment in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam, he told AFP last year.

Only after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018 did Sirak feel comfortable handing it over.

He then contacted Arthur Brand, a renowned Dutch art detective, who brought the story to the Dutch government’s attention. “We’re honoured and delighted to have been able to facilitate the rightful return,” Kaag, the Dutch minister, said in a statement Thursday.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/rare-ethiopian-crown--hidden-for-21-yrs-in-the-netherlands--returns-home.html
203,21-2-20,The natural look,"Even though the results may be slower, organic skin care products are gentle on skin and won’t harm in the long run, says Ayushi Sharma

When organic skincare products came into India, it was assumed that they would be another elitist fad, which would eventually fade away with each passing day. However, as the benefit of natural, plant-based cosmetics spread, the bigger brands spurred an interest in our native traditions and birthed home brands as well.

One of the major reasons why the demand kept on growing in India is due to the country’s constantly increasing digital literacy rate, shares Vedika Sharma, Director at Mantra Herbal. She feels that people are now becoming more conscious of and familiar about the benefits of organic products and trying to avoid the harmful effects of chemicals and fertilisers used during farming. “The personal care space has mostly been defined by three terms — ayurveda, wellness and organic. From a marketing standpoint, ayurveda is more of a mass play. On the other hand, organic has emerged as an alternative to ayurveda with a more premium positioning,” says she.

While the Director at The Imperial Spa and Salon, Jacqualine Tara Herron, who recently announced association with French luxury skincare brand, Olivier Claire, tells us that from the growers to the market place and on to the consumer, the economy is greatly influenced by these intelligent choices. Director at O3plus, Vidur Kapur, believes that even though the future of organic products is bright, the degree of result may vary if you compare it to a dermatological product.

Impact of organic products

Certified organic products are derived from plants and other naturally occurring ingredients. More importantly, those ingredients are grown without the use of pesticides, herbicides, synthetic fertilisers, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and other additives or chemicals. Tara says, “More and more of us are seeking ways to redress the balance of pollution that can damage the skin and destroy the skins ability to regenerate. The synthetic ingredients found in non-organic products may be fast acting, but they are also invasive, causing harm that cannot be seen. Olivier Claire products and treatments have an integral protective and preservative nature that combats the effects of negative stress on the skin caused by environmental hazards.”

Vedika tells us that the use of toxic chemicals worsens the skin’s natural barrier and accelerates the damage by disrupting pH balance and can even cause skin cancer in the long run. “Given Delhi’s air pollution level and atmosphere, it causes many skin problems brown spots, wrinkles, redness, enlarged pores and dry patches. Even though the results may be slower, organic skin care products are gentle on your skin and won’t harm you in the long run,” says she.

Newer natural ingredients

On the surface of the skin, there is something known as microbiome, which is made up of bacteria, fungi and viruses. This makes certain chemicals that keep the skin healthy and help your skin’s barrier stay intact. Skincare experts note that this is set to go mainstream this year.

The trends also points towards ‘less-but-better’ attitude. Experts say that brands need to evolve with this concept understanding that consumers are looking to purchase fewer items that still deliver all of the results they want.

Vedika feels the concept of “blue beauty,” is on the rise, which will push people to use marine-friendly products. The say if it is bad for marine life, why do you think it is good for your skin? “Waterless beauty is the next thing in the industry, which means that brands will reduce water consumption in making the products,” says she. Keeping in mind the current air pollution situation, anti-pollution skincare will become synonymous with sun protection, she adds.

Also, the biggest shift in Vidur’s opinion is going to be towards mens skincare range of products. “While the mainstream media has historically targetted women when it comes to grooming products, more options for men’s personal care are emerging,” she says and adds that the star ingredient of the products is going to be caffeine.

Perception of beauty may vary

A good state of health isn’t a process that you can master overnight, it takes a lot of baby steps and determination. The definition of beauty keeps on changing but something that stays constant is the fact that internal beauty really does matter over the external charm. And skincare brands must prioritise internal intangibles — like being comfortable in one’s own skin and feeling confident — over external features.

The good news is that focussing on a few, simple things can make a massive difference to how you look and feel. In Vedika’s opinion, healthy skin comes from a combination of a good diet and use of natural skincare products. She says, “Good nutrition implies what to avoid. Veggies and water can only hydrate your organs. Skin is also an organ of the body and water also evaporates from it easily. Hence, moisturisers seal moisture in skin. Skincare have ingredients that penetrate and work on the problem area directly. For instance, dark circles won’t just fade away with an eye cream. A healthy diet and sound sleep will work together along with a good skincare product.”

Tara believes that inner beauty is long lasting. You don’t need costly cosmetics or expensive surgeries to keep it intact. There are many brands that cater to this concept. One such example is Dove. Olivier Claire focus on it too. The products have been harmlessly harvested from natural sources. Key ingredients such as native stem cells from sunflower pollen, wakame seaweed and sea fennel are scientifically tested to achieve the best results.

Inner beauty enhances your external charm. It gives you the confidence to face the world and its problems, which is something far greater than the standards that had been set by the society, feels Vidur.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-natural-look-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-natural-look.html
204,21-2-20,India hope to continue fine run,"Hosts India would look to continue their fine form when they take on title holders Australia in their next FIH Pro League tie here on Friday.

India have made an excellent start to their maiden FIH Hockey Pro League season and are currently sitting third in the table with eight points from four games.

The Manpreet Singh-led side claimed five points from a possible six against the Netherlands before claiming another three in a stunning 2-1 victory over Belgium, the reigning World and European champions. The Red Lions bounced back with a 3-2 win in the second match.

Few would dispute that India, coached by former Australian international Graham Reid and captained by newly crowned FIH Men’s Player of the Year Manpreet, are playing their best hockey in recent years.

It would also be India’s penultimate home tie at the Kalinga Stadium here before they embark on a series of away games. But past records and statistics don't look promising for the hosts as Australia have an outstanding recent record against India.

The world no.2 Kookaburras have won 22 of their last 30 meetings against world no.4 India and have not faced a defeat since a 2016 Test match in Bendigo, Australia, when VR Raghunath scored twice in a 3-2 win.

Australia, managed by Colin Batch, who was recently named 2019 Men's FIH Coach of the Year, also have an imperious record at the Kalinga Stadium, a venue where they have not suffered a defeat in regular time since a semi-final loss at the hands of Germany at the Hero Champions Trophy in 2014.

The Australians were unbeaten in all six matches on the way to claiming the title at the 2017 Hockey World League Final, and won five of their six matches at the Odisha Hockey Men's World Cup 2018, with only the Netherlands getting the better of them in a semi-final shoot-out after the regular time finished 2-2.

The Kookaburras will be in a confident mood coming into the tie after their recent performances against Great Britain in the FIH Pro League, where they claimed five points out of six.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-hope-to-continue-fine-run.html

Poonam was suffering from injuries in the buildup to the tournament and she thanked her physio and teammates to help her get back to match fitness in time for the World Cup.

""My physio and my teammates supported me a lot when I was injured. I bowled well against Australia here in the past so I wanted to continue that,"" she said in the post-match presentation ceremony.

Poonam dismissed Rachael Haynes and Australia's star all-rounder Elysse Perry off consecutive balls and would have got the hat-trick had it not been for Taniya Bhatia dropping Jess Jonassen in what was a rare mistake from the wicketkeeper. ""This is the third time that I didn't get a hat-trick. I am thankful to my teammates as it is not easy to come back after an injury,"" she said.

Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur said that the victory is a sign of India becoming becoming better as a team.

210,21-2-20,Koregaon-Bhima judicial panel urged to summon Pawar,"The Koregaon-Bhima judicial inquiry Commission has received an application seeking summoning of NCP president Sharad Pawar in view of certain statements made by him in the media about the 2018 caste violence near here.

Sagar Shinde, a member of the Vivek Vichar Manch, a social group, on Thursday filed the application before the panel through his advocate Pradip Gawade, seeking that Pawar be asked to depose before the two-member commission.

In his plea, Shinde cited a press conference of Pawar held on February 18.

As per the application, at the press meet Pawar alleged that right-wing activists Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide had created a ""different"" atmosphere in Koregaon-Bhima, located on outskirts of Pune city, and its vicinity.

""In the same press conference, Mr Pawar also alleges that the role of Pune city police commissioner is doubtful and must be investigated. These statements are within the purview of the terms of reference of this commission and therefore they are relevant,"" Shinde said the plea.

The applicant said he has reasons to believe Pawar has relevant and additional information, apart from what he has already shared in his earlier affidavit filed before the panel regarding the violence and other related matters.

""Therefore, in the interest of justice, this applicant makes a prayer to the commission to issue a summon to Mr Pawar and require him to depose in person and furnish additional information he has so that the commission can arrive at its findings in a just and fair manner,"" he said.

Pawar had, on October 8, 2018, filed an affidavit before the commission, headed by former Bombay High Court Chief Justice J N Patel. Former Maharashtra chief secretary Sumit Mullick is the other member of the judicial panel.

The former Union minister, in his affidavit, had stated, ""I would not be in a position to factually point out the chronology of the said events as that would be the domain of the existing Law andOrder machinery.""

He had also stated, ""I would not be in a position to specifically make allegations against any particular organisation.

""However, it is unfortunate that the state government and law and enforcement authorities failed to protect the interest of the common man residing at Koregaon Bhima and its vicinity.""

Pawar's party is now a key constituent in the Shiv Sena-led government in the state. The commission was set up when the BJP was in power in Maharashtra.

The former chief minister had further stated the active role of ""right-wing"" forces behind the violence at Koregaon Bhima can not be ruled out.

However, concrete evidence in this regard can be gathered only by law enforcement agencies of the state, he had said in the affidavit.

Gathering of anti-social elements in large numbers at Koregaon Bhima indicated the failure of law enforcement agencies, the NCP leader had told the panel.

""Hence, thestate of Maharashtra has to own the responsibility of a failed law and order situation on January 1, 2018,"" he had stated.

On January 1, 2018, violence had erupted in Koregaon Bhima and nearby areas during the 200th anniversary celebrations of the Koregaon-Bhima battle.

The commission was constituted by the then BJP government to find out what led to the violence.

The Pune police have alleged ""provocative"" speeches given at the 'Elgar Parishad conclave', held on December 31, 2017, triggered the violence.

Suryakant Pradhan (2/96), Preet Singh Chohan (2/52) and Basant Mohanty (1/48) used the early moisture to advantage and blew away the Bengal top order.

But old warhorse Majumdar, playing in his sixth match of the season, led a turnaround with an unbeaten 136 (20 fours), a composed innings that came under tremendous pressure.

In the process, Patel also completed 11,000 first-class runs.

For Goa, Verma was the pick of the bowlers, while Darshan Misal and Vijesh Prabhudesai (1-60) took a wicket each.

Saurashtra post 226/6

Ongole: Fighting half-centuries by Vishvarajsingh Jadeja (73, 179 balls, 10 fours), Chirag Jani (53, 128 balls, 5 fours) and Sheldon Jackson (50) helped Saurashtra make 226 for 6 in 79 overs against Andhra.

For the home team, left-arm medium-pacer Yarra Prithvi Raj was impressive, picking up three wickets in 20 overs conceding 51 runs. K V Sashikanth picked up two wickets.

A lot will now depend on Jani and the lower-order including captain Jaydev Unadkat if Saurashtra has to post a fighting total in the last-eight match.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ton-up-majumdar-scripts-dramatic-turnaround-for-bengal.html
214,21-2-20,Indian Eves begin chase for 1st ICC title,"The Indian women’s cricket team will be aiming for much needed consistency when it opens its bid for an elusive ICC trophy with the T20 World Cup opener against defending champions Australia here on today.

Inconsistency has plagued India for a long time and a classic example was their performance in the recently held tri-series in Australia where they reached the final.

They won and lost a game against the more accomplished England and Australia before losing to the mighty hosts, who have won the T20 World Cup a record four times out of the six editions held so far.

India’ middle and lower-order needs to do a lot better than what it has been doing to beat the likes of Australia and England in the knock-out stages, something that has been been acknowledged star opener Smriti Mandhana.

The team needs to ensure that the frequent middle-order collapses are not repeated in the showpiece event.

The southpaw and 16-year-old Shafali Verma will have to get India off to a flying start more often than not in the competition.

Expectations are high from skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who too has suffered from inconsistency and would like to correct that, beginning with the opener against Australia.

It remains to be seen if the other 16-year-old in the squad, Richa Ghosh, gets to play regularly as she made her international debut only in the final of the tri-series.

In the bowling department, they have heavily relied on spinners with not many quality pacers to choose from.

Shikha Pandey, who is often the lone pacer in the playing eleven full of spinners, has the crucial task of providing early breakthroughs.

The squad is expected to reach the last four as it had two years ago but the growing women’s game in India will get a further fillip only if they go all the way.

Long gone are the days when women cricketers were a neglected lot and have all the facilities at their disposal.

They take on Australia, who could not have asked for a better build-up to the tournament than winning the preceding tri-series.

However, they suffered a big blow on the eve of the tournament opener as their lead pacer Tayla Vlaeminck, who had troubled the Indian batters in the tri-series with extra pace, was ruled out of the competition due to a foot injury. Off-spinner Molly Strano was named her replacement.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-eves-begin-chase-for-1st-icc-title.html
215,21-2-20,‘NZ start favourites but 320 is good first innings score’,"A first innings total in the range of 320 on a bouncy Basin Reserve track is what India vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane is aiming for despite calling New Zealand the favourites going into the first Test starting here on Friday.

“I think New Zealand are favourites in their home conditions. But I still feel the host country remains favourite because they know what to bowl and batsman are aware of what shots to play.

“As a unit we need to learn and adapt quickly as New Zealand grounds have different angles,” Rahane said on a cautious note on the eve of the Test match.

But the 2014 win at Lord’s or the 2018 victory in Adelaide had come with modest first innings scores of under 300 (295 at Lord’s and 250 at Adelaide), a template that can be executed in Wellington also, feels the stylish Mumbaikar.

“When you bat first, your mindset is always positive, not saying that it’s not when you bowl first. If you get 320 to 330 outside India in first innings, it’s a very good total. “All the matches if you see we won (in England and Australia), we got around 320 to 350 runs on the board in the first innings,” said Rahane.

While 320 may not be a big score but Rahane’s confidence stems from the fact that India’s world class pace attack, which has shown ability to pick 20 wickets in overseas conditions.

“We know that our bowlers can take wickets in any condition but suppose you lose the toss and have to bat first, you should know that you are in right kind of mindset to actually go out there and tackle those situations.

“Keeping mindset right in seaming conditions even if you lose the toss is really important. Same goes to bowlers who should keep their mindset right on flat wickets. They should actually have the belief to take 20 wickets on flat tracks,” said the veteran of 63 Tests.

While he called the home team the favourites but Rahane and his teammates are enjoying the phase where the current batch under Virat Kohli is expected to win Test series outside sub-continent following their historic triumph in Australia last year.

“There is no awe about conditions anymore. Every condition is home condition for us. Irrespective of victory or defeat, expectation is bound to be there. As a team, we want to enjoy this phase where people feel that we are favourites wherever we go,” the confident deputy of Kohli said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---nz-start-favourites-but-320-is-good-first-innings-score---.html
216,21-2-20,India ready to taste Kiwi pace,"India’s battle-hardened cricketers are ready for their toughest challenge of the World Test Championship till date as they face formidable hosts New Zealand on a spicy Basin Reserve track in the series-opener beginning here today.

Virat Kohli’s top-ranked team, with 360 points in its kitty, is certainly the favourite on paper but the Black Caps under Kane Williamson are experts at wearing down opposition with their patience on pitches which turn flat as the game progresses.

The last time New Zealand lost a series at home was back in March 2017 and since then have won five (10 Tests) in familiar conditions.

For New Zealand, it is time to pick up pieces after their 0-3 drubbing in Australia while the current Indian team would love to reassert that they are the best when it comes to winning in adverse conditions like they did in Australia last year.

The open Basin Reserve ground has always been challenging for both batsmen and bowlers due to cross winds.

And the new opening pair of Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal will have its task cut out against a top class seam attack comprising Trent Boult, Tim Southee, and Kyle Jamieson, who in all likelihood will make his debut.

However, the absence of left arm speedster Neil Wagner, who could have created awkward angles with his short balls, will provide some respite for the Indian middle-order. Wagner is on a break to welcome his first child.

New Zealand named their 12 on the day and it will be a choice between seamer all-rounder Daryl Mitchell or slow left-arm orthodox Ajaz Patel.

In an open ground with overcast conditions expected, captain Kohli will not mind winning the toss and unleash Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma and Mohammed Shami on the home team.

Even Kohli admitted that his men would need to have tons of patience once the track eases out as Williamson’s team is known to the play waiting game.

“It doesn’t matter how much patience opposition has, we have to show more patience. We can’t really prepare in a manner where New Zealand show more patience and put pressure on us,” skipper Kohli made his intentions clear during a media interaction.

While New Zealand are expected to go with four frontline pacers and may be a fifth seamer in all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme, the Indian team management might be tempted to try out Ravichandran Ashwin, who purely as a spinner, has more variety compared to left-arm orthodox of Ravindra Jadeja.

The wind factor in Wellington is an issue that captains need to deal with and Kohli is no different as he will have to judiciously choose ends for his bowlers.

“If breeze is blowing across the ground, who is more effective with inswinger or outswingers, these things you think as a captain,” said Kohli.

The return of Trent Boult for New Zealand and Ishant for India, from their respective injuries will certainly bolster both the sides.

For India, Cheteshwar Pujara, Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane will have to be the foil around Shaw, Agarwal and Vihari with their techniques being tested.

“As a batsman, you need to think that ball might not travel in the air a lot more when you are hitting against the wind. So you need to be prepared to run a lot more which we experienced last time and if you have a light bat, you are in trouble.

“You need to be firm with your stance and where your bat is as it can really swing around,” added Kohli, who is India’s best batsman by a mile.

According to sources, this will be the first time no delegation of the principal opposition party will be meeting a visiting US President.

Trump is visiting India on February 24 and 25, and is expected to participate in a number of events during his less than 36-hours stay.

222,21-2-20,"Road at Shaheen Bagh opened by group of protesters, blocked again: Police","A stretch of the road closed for over two months in Shaheen Bagh due to an anti-citizenship law protest was ""opened"" by a group of demonstrators on Saturday, only to be closed after some time, police said.

""Road number 9 in Shaheen Bagh was reopened by a group of protesters, but later it was closed by another group,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) R P Meena said.

Protestors claimed that they ""opened"" the stretch, which would allow passage to commuters between Noida and South Delhi, at around 5 pm near the protest site, but the Delhi police and the Noida police were continuing to barricade it from one side.

The road, which connects Noida to south east Delhi and further to Faridabad in Haryana, was closed for traffic in the wake of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protest at Shaheen Bagh since December 15.

The development came after three days of talks between the Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors -- senior advocates Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran -- and the protesters over the issue of difficulty to commuters due to blocking of roads.

According to the police, the protesters briefly opened a small portion of a road leading to Kalindi Kunj so that locals can pass through it with their two wheelers.

The Noida Traffic Police, however, also continued the restrictions on the Uttar Pradesh side of the road, an official told PTI.

""It was being alleged repeatedly that the protestors have blocked the Kalindi Kunj road, which leads to Noida Sector 37. So, today it was decided that this allegation has to be done away with and the route was opened,"" Sonu Warsi, a protestor, said.

""The decision was also taken to give a gift to the Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors, whose interaction and mediation has helped reopen the case. We have opened the road and it is now up to the Delhi Police and UP police to decide which vehicles they will allow,"" he added.

After the talks on Friday, Hegde had said the protesters, in principle, were not fundamentally against opening of the non-protest side of the road if their security could be guaranteed in writing by the Delhi Police under suitable orders of the apex court.

""We will not be holding a public interaction tomorrow to enable the protesters to come to an independent conclusion as to the way forward. We will return on Sunday only if we deem it necessary and feasible to do so,"" he had said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/road-at-shaheen-bagh-opened-by-group-of-protesters--blocked-again--police-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/road-at-shaheen-bagh-opened-by-group-of-protesters--blocked-again--police.html
223,21-2-20,Nationalism likened to Nazism: Bhagwat,"Modi, Shah can’t always help BJP win Assembly polls: RSS

Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday said the word “nationalism” is nowadays equated with Hitler’s “nazism” or Mussolini’s “fascism” and it is better to avoid this word, stressing on using some alternative terms.

Bhagwat’s remark came amid continued protests in several cities of the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which is branded by those opposing the CAA as a reflection of “Hindutva nationalism” that is detrimental to Muslims.

Besides, analysing the results of this month’s Delhi Assembly polls, the BJP’s ideological mentor RSS said in an editorial in its mouthpiece on Thursday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah cannot always help the BJP win Assembly elections.

Recalling an RSS event in the United Kingdom (UK), Bhagwat said, “During my recent visit to the UK, I was advised by an RSS worker not to use the word ‘nationalism’ as English is not our language and it could have a different meaning in England. It's okay to say nation, national and nationality but not nationalism. Because it means (alludes to) Hitler, Nazism and Fascism (in England).”

Calling upon RSS members to connect with people irrespective of their caste, language, religion or region, Bhagwat said India’s characteristic is to bind everyone in one thread following the principle of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (the world is a family).

“We (Indians) live for each other, not for ourselves. We believe that the world has made us and we have to give back to it. We look at the world with gratitude,” he said.

Sharing an anecdote, he said, a Muslim intellectual from the country once went for Haj and was sent to jail on blasphemy charges for wearing a “locket”. The then

Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj, intervened and got him released within eight days, he said, apparently suggesting that everyone from India is considered a Hindu outside the country.

“...Because Bharatiya sanskriti (Indian culture) is also known as Hindu sanskriti, reflecting its values, ethos and culture,” he said.

The RSS chief also gave a call to make India a superpower.

Bhagwat said, “The aim of the Sangh is to unite Hindu society. The Swayamsevaks are dedicated to their aim. By feeling proud of the culture of our country we have to work to take the country to new heights. We have to make India a world ‘Guru’. It is time to make India a superpower, but not like other superpowers that misuse their influence.”

He added, “What do countries do when they become the strongest? With superpower status they try to exert their influence on other countries, exploiting their resources for themselves. This is the reason researchers think that a country becoming too powerful is bad for the world.”

Bhagwat, who is on a five day visit to Jharkhand, was addressing “Sangh Samagam” of RSS volunteers on college ground of Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee University, Morhabadi, Ranchi.

The meeting was attended by former Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das, Ranchi MLA and former Minister CP Singh, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth and BJP leaders, besides RSS volunteers.

The RSS chief, on the occasion, also expressed concern over environmental imbalance urging the people to work for protecting the environment. He said entire world has seen the affects of playing with environment and in present context China is an example.

Bhagwat, who enjoys Z+ security cover by a special group of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) due to the threat perception against him, reached Birsa Munda Airport on Wednesday. On Thursday apart from attending the Sangh Samagam, he also addressed a meeting on IIM campus, followed by meeting at Maheshwari Bhavan. The RSS chief will be in State capital on Friday and Saturday too and will leave for Giridih the same day.

The RSS chief visit to State assumes importance as there are around 60,000 full time RSS worker in State and the organisation is working to increase its members. In Jharkhand the Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram a wing of RSS has its activities for Scheduled Tribes in remote areas of Jharkhand.

The BJP tasted defeat in the Delhi Assembly elections for the second consecutive time, increasing its tally from three to just eight seats, while Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) scooped 62 of 70 seats.

The article in The Organiser said, “...the apparent failure of BJP to revitalise the organisational structure at the grassroots level after 2015 and building up of the campaign on in the last leg of the elections were the two major reasons for defeat in the well-fought out battle. But Narendra Modi and Amit Shah cannot always help out in the Assembly level elections and there is no option but to rebuild the organisation in Delhi to address the local aspirations of the masses is the clear message,” it added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nationalism-likened-to-nazism--bhagwat-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nationalism-likened-to-nazism--bhagwat.html
224,21-2-20,RaGa likely to return as Cong prez in April,"This comes after many leaders call for full-time party president

Rahul Gandhi is all set to be back as the Congress chief in the party’s plenary session in April. Rahul had quit the post following the Congress rout in the Lok Sabha polls last year.

Congress Working Committee (CWC) had appointed Sonia Gandhi as interim president of the party in August last year. But as the unwell Sonia had to skip the party’s campaign in the recent Assembly polls, the calls for Rahul to head the party have become stronger.

The Congress on Thursday said Rahul was a clear choice for the party president’s post. Party sources said Rahul was the only contender, hinting that elections in that case may not even be necessary.

“Rahul has acceptability across the country and also the capability to lead the party,” said a senior Congress leader.

Several party leaders have called for the appointment of a full-time party president. On Thursday, former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor, who has been advocating elections to the CWC, said, “I renew my appeal to CWC to hold leadership elections to energise workers and inspire voters.”

“I was referring to my earlier call — eight months ago — for elections among the 10,000 party workers who constitute the ‘AICC plus PCC delegates’ list. These should be for the elected seats in the CWC as well as for the party presidency,” said Tharoor.

Former MP Sandeep Dikshit has accused senior leaders of failing to find a new president because they are “scared who will bell the cat”.

Reacting to the remarks, Tharoor tweeted, “What Sandeep Dikshit said openly is what dozens of party leaders from across the country are saying privately, including many with responsible positions in the party. I renew my appeal to CWC to hold leadership elections to energise workers and inspire voters.”

Asked about the remarks made by Tharoor and Dikshit, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the CWC will decide on the Congress chief post.

“If anyone has any doubts about this, he should kindly read the resolution of the CWC before giving any statements in public,” Surjewala said.

“Instead of giving statements on social media and interviews in the media, if Sandeep Dikshit works hard in his own constituency and politically encash the work initiated during Sheila Dikshit’s rule, the Congress will emerge victorious. It is my appeal to every leader like Dikshit that instead of giving knowledge to the entire country, they should first show the benefits of their own work done in their constituencies,” he said.

After the Congress was decimated in the just concluded Delhi Assembly elections, the question of leadership is being raised from within the party. A senior Congress leader said that if Rahul Gandhi had been president, the result could have been better in Haryana and Maharashtra. “Since Soniaji was not mostly unwell, there has been a leadership vacuum and that affected the party’s performance,” he said.

Earlier In 2017, Rahul Gandhi was elected president unopposed following demand from different quarters of the party, but after the drubbing faced by the party in the 2019 general elections that saw the Congress barely getting over 50 seats, losing out to even being called the Opposition, the Gandhi scion resigned.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/raga-likely-to-return--as-cong-prez-in-april-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/raga-likely-to-return--as-cong-prez-in-april.html
225,21-2-20,Nirbhaya convict tries mental trick to escape death,"Vinay moves court, seeks treatment for ‘schizophrenia’

In what could be termed as another attempt to buy more time and delay the hanging of the four death-row convicts of the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case, Vinay Sharma, one of them, moved the court on Thursday and demanded better treatment for his “mental illness”.

The court has sought response from the Tihar jail authorities on a plea by Vinay, who through his counsel sought remedy for his claimed mental illness, schizophrenia and the injuries suffered in his head and arms.

Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Dharmender Rana directed the prison authorities to file its reply on the plea of Vinay on Saturday.

“Vinay injured himself by banging his head on his cell wall in Tihar Jail. The incident happened in jail number 3 on Sunday afternoon and he got some minor injuries and was treated inside the prison premises,” said a prison official.

During the hearing, the prosecution opposed the plea saying it was not maintainable. Counsel for Vinay told the court that he was refusing to recognise people, including his mother.

The plea claimed that when Vinay’s counsel visited him in the prison on the request of his family members, he found that he had sustained grievous head injury, fractures in his right arm with plaster and was suffering from insanity, mental illness and schizophrenia.

“Vinay could not identify his counsel and his mother in jail,” it said.

The petition further claimed that he was having decreased sleep for a long time and was referred to senior psychiatrist in view of drug dependence.

The court had on February 17 issued fresh death warrants for March 3 at 6 am against the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.

It had issued fresh warrants against death row convicts -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay (26) and Akshay Kumar (31). This is the third time that death warrants have been issued against them.

A senior prison official said that Vinay is irritable in nature and acts different from the other three convicts. His nature is different from the other three.

A Delhi court on Monday ordered that Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) -- the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case be hanged on at 6 am on March 3.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-convict-tries-mental-trick-to-escape-death-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nirbhaya-convict-tries-mental-trick-to-escape-death.html
226,21-2-20,No light at end of Shaheen Bagh tunnel?,"As protesters dig in heels, mediators say resolution needed otherwise SC will act

The mediation attempt by Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors — advocates Sanjay Hedge and Sadhana Ramachandran — to persuade the Shaheen Bagh protesters to lift blockade of the Delhi-Noida main road remained futile for the second day on Thursday. The protesters patiently expressed their anguish but refused to budge from their day 1 demand that they would end protest only after the CAA is repealed and proposed NRC is shelved.

After holding talks with the protesters, Hegde and Ramachandran left for the day. It is understood they are likely to visit the protest site again on Friday to find an amicable solution to end the impasse. The road blockade has been going on since December 15.

Like Wednesday, Hedge and Ramachandran expressed their unwillingness to talk with protesters in the presence of the media. As Ramachandran started addressing the protesters reporters surrounding the dais tried to suggest her on how to hold talks. It angered her, and she asked the mediapersons to leave the tent where the talks were to be resumed.

Ramachandran began addressing the protesters saying, “Aapne bulaya, hum chale aaye (You called us and we are here)”. Hegde said the SC has recognised their right to protest, but added “the rights of others have to be respected”.

“When Shaheen Bagh has become an example of protests in India, let us set an example of a protest that does not disturb anybody. You all must be rest assured that we are here to fight for you. Don’t think if you change your spot, your fight will die down,” Hegde said.

“We have seen many PMs come and go. Whoever comes in power and runs the country, sometimes some could be right and some could be wrong. Whatever you are saying the whole country and the PM are listening,” he added.

Ramchandran said she is waiting for that day when the country’s atmosphere will change. Then an elderly man expressed his fear, “I am very scared... I am very scared for my children. Madam save me,” he said. When Ramchandran asked him more about his fear, the man replied, “I am a single father. I will die but my children should get to live here fearlessly. My girls go to school where they are being told that you will go out of the country.”

Another man, while talking to the interlocutors, said, “I have a national flag on my bicycle. We love this country and stop calling us traitors.”

On Monday, the Supreme Court observed that the blockade of the road at Shaheen Bagh was “troubling” and suggested the protesters go to another site where no public place would be blocked. It, however, upheld their right to protest.

The apex court also asked Hegde to “play a constructive role as an interlocutor” to persuade the protesters to move to an alternative site. It said the interlocutors could seek former bureaucrat Wajahat Habibullah’s assistance.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-light-at-end-of-shaheen-bagh-tunnel--2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/no-light-at-end-of-shaheen-bagh-tunnel-.html

233,21-2-20,Mumbai cops had intel on killing of Gulshan Kumar: Rakesh Maria,"The Mumbai police had detailed intelligence on a plot to kill music baron Gulshan Kumar, down to the name of the underworld don whose gang had been assigned the task, and did all it could to protect him but the appearance of the UP Police upset the equation, former Maharashtra DGP Rakesh Maria writes in his memoirs.

It began with a telephone call in the early hours of April 22, 1997.

""Sir, Gulshan Kumar ka wicket girne wala hai (Sir, Gulshan Kumar is about to be assassinated),"" the voice on the other end said.

Who is the wicket taker, Maria asked.

""Abu Salem, saab. Usne apne shooters ke saath sab plan nakki kiya hai. Gulshan Kumar roz subah gharse nikalke pehle ek Shiv mandir jata hai. Wahin pe kaam khatam karne wale hain. (Abu Salem is the one planning to kill Gulshan Kumar. He has finalised the plan with his shooters. The first thing that Gulshan Kumasr does in the morning after leaving home each day is to go to a nearby Shiv temple. That is where they ar going to bump him off),"" the informant replied.

At daybreak, Maria writes in ""Let Me Say It Now"", he called film producer-director Mahesh Bhatt and asked him whether he knew Gulshan Kumar and whether he was aware that he visited a Shiv temple every morning. Maria also told Bhatt the reason he was asking.

Bhatt called back after a while to confirm the information.

""Then I told Bhatt I would be briefing the Crime Branch and he must tell Gulshan Kumar not to stir out of the house till the Crime Branch had got in touch with him and made arrangements for his safety,"" Maria, at the time Assistant Inspector General (Law and Order, and Crime) as a Staff Officer to the DGP, Arvind Inamdar, writes.

""I then called up the Crime Branch and gave them the details furnished by my informant. The Crime Branch then extended the requisite protection to Gulshan Kumar.

""Therefore, it came as a big shock to me when on 12 August 1997, I received a call that conveyed the news of Gulshan Kumar's murder, in the manner that it had been described,"" Maria writes.

It transpired that a contingent of the UP Police had begun providing security to Gulshan Kumar as he had a cassette factory in Noida. The protection provided by the Mumbai police was, therefore, withdrawn.

""Somewhere down the line, routine and apathy could have set in, as it often happens in prolonged watch and ward duties,"" Maria writes.

He also passed on information to the Crime Branch in late 1966 of a plan to kill trade union leader Datta Samat, who hit the headlines in the 1980s when he led a bruising strike that led to the closure of some 80 mills and rendered nearly 250,000 workers jobless in what was then India's textile hub.

On January 16, 1997, Maria received news that Datta Samat had been shot dead. He also got a call from R.S. Sharma, the Joint (CP) Crime, to get in touch with the investigating team ""to see if I could throw more light on the matter and assist them in the investigation"".

Maria doesn't say whether or not he did, but he does write: ""My junior officers...used to joke that I was a foreteller of doom!""",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mumbai-cops-had-intel-on-killing-of-gulshan-kumar--rakesh-maria-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/mumbai-cops-had-intel-on-killing-of-gulshan-kumar--rakesh-maria.html
234,21-2-20,"To joggers’ delight, Ashram to Naraina special corridor","Stretch to be redeveloped on lines of American Road designs, architecture

Jogging, cycling or long walk on the roads of the national Capital is fraught with danger due to the sheer volume of vehicular traffic. In its bid to ensure safe corridors for pedestrians, morning walkers and joggers, Public Works Department (PWD) has started creating a “separate and safe” lane for pedestrians and Non-Motorised Vehicles (NMVs) from Ashram to Naraina.

Part of the Delhi Government’s dream project “Street scaping, beautification and widening”, the stretch will be completely redeveloped on the standards of American Road designs and architecture.

The main agenda behind this project is to create a pedestrian-friendly road by making the people feel happy with green ambience and

“zero” traffic hurdles while traveling on these roads. The total estimated cost of the redevelopment plan for this stretch is Rs 75 crore, said a Government official.

“The stretch from Ashram to Naraina barring Moolchand to Moti Bagh will be redeveloped, beautified and widened. The stretch will be developed on American standards with an aim to provide a pedestrian-friendly as well as disabled-friendly road. Encroachment and narrow roads are also another issue on this stretch, which will be cleared,” added the official.

As per the official, the proposal was passed by the Government last year but the project could not start due to the imposition of Model Code of Conduct (MCC) for the Delhi Assembly elections. However, the work on the stretch has started and is expected to be completed by December 2020.

AIIMS to Ashram is one of the identified and selected stretches from the 10 most congested roads of Delhi. Currently on this stretch, the bus stops and pedestrian facilities such as FOBs and subways are in un-designated places, for instance far from the bus stop or very close to ramp of the flyover, which becomes one of the main reasons for accidents.

“Further, during the study of this stretch, the department found that there is no facility for NMV vehicles and pedestrians, termination of service lanes at junctions, parking are very close to intersections which hinder the movements. Moreover, due to the poor condition of the street, barrier-free movement becomes impossible,” said the official.

“Thus, the PWD has decided to beautify and streetscape the roads by giving an aesthetic look and to provide maximum basic facilities to the road users as per the norms of United Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering (UTTIPEC) and pedestrians can walk, jog and cycle without any fear,” said the official.

Under the street-scaping and beautification of roads, the PWD will redesign and provide good infrastructure such as bus stops, separate lane for pedestrians, stands for auto-rickshaws, cycles and e-rickshaws will be created.

The official further said that public toilets, drinking water points, police booths, separate parking for police and emergency vehicles would also be provided. It has been deemed necessary to provide basic amenities to the people and also ensure cleanliness on the stretches.

Separate street vending zones, mohalla clinics, public canteens, maps, traffic signages, green carpeting and seating arrangements will also be developed. Once this project is completed, the outcome would be analysed and new such corridors would be developed in other parts of the city as well, the official said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/to-joggers----delight--ashram-to-naraina-special-corridor-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/to-joggers----delight--ashram-to-naraina-special-corridor.html
235,21-2-20,China denies delay in granting permission to special Indian flight to Wuhan,"China on Friday denied any delay in allowing a special Indian flight to the coronavirus-hit Wuhan city to deliver medical supplies and evacuate remaining Indians from there, saying the concerned departments of both the countries were in touch to finalise the schedule.

India on February 17 announced that it will send Indian Air Force's largest plane C-17 Globemaster with medical supplies to Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus, and bring back its nationals as well as citizens from all neighbouring countries who were still stuck there on the return flight.

The special flight to Wuhan is reportedly awaiting clearance from China.

India evacuated 647 Indians and seven Maldivians by operating two Special Air India flights to Wuhan earlier this month.

Asked why there is a delay in granting permission to the third Indian flight, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told an online press briefing on Friday that China has assisted India earlier to evacuate a large number of Indians from Wuhan and Hubei province.

“The competent departments on the two sides are still in communication on the arrangement for the remaining 80 people that India plans to fly home. There is no such a thing as China delaying giving flight permissions,” he said.

Geng said the Chinese government attaches high importance to the lives and health of all foreign nationals in China.

A Chinese official on Thursday said 29 foreign nationals in China were infected with the novel coronavirus and 18 of them have recovered.

“We have offered them all the necessary help they need and will continue to do so. At present, China's prevention efforts have been proven to be effective,” he said, referring to Chinese health officials' observation that the cases of the virus have started declining.

“We hope that relevant countries will respect the reasonable recommendations given by the WHO (World Health Organisation) and avoid overreacting. China will continue to work with the international community to fight against the epidemic and promote the global cause of public health,” he said.

Meanwhile, the death toll in the novel coronavirus in China has rose to 2,236 with 118 more casualties reported, mostly from the hard-hit Hubei province, while the overall confirmed infection cases have climbed to 75,465, Chinese health officials said on Friday.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-denies-delay-in-granting-permission-to-special-indian-flight-to-wuhan-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-denies-delay-in-granting-permission-to-special-indian-flight-to-wuhan.html

241,21-2-20,'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan': Shallow but fun (IANS Review; Rating: * * *),"""Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan""; Cast: Ayushmann Khurrana, Jitendra Kumar, Neena Gupta, Gajraj Rao, Manurishi Chaddha; Director: Hitesh Kewalya; Rating: * * * (three stars)

At one level you are watching the same old Bollywood rom-com, about two lovebirds trying to unite against all odds, against parental censure and societal diktats. It's all done with feel-good verve too, with the mandatory naach-gaana and ‘shaadi ka tamasha' thrown in.

Only, ""Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan"" always looked different despite the cliches. The film grabbed eyeballs from the day it was announced because the lovebirds in the frame weren't a guy and a girl. This was commercial Bollywood's first ever homosexual rom-com, catering the story of a couple of loverboys.

Which denotes a big leap for mainstream Hindi cinema. The love story has traditionally been the most commonplace money machine among all genres in Bollywood. To retain every stereotype of the genre and turn the lucrative package into a quiet little snub at homophobes, amid standard hilarity and melodrama, is actually quite an experiment to pull off, and debutant writer-director Hitesh Kewalya deserves kudos if only for that much.

""Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan"" sets out to narrate that idea through a screenplay set against a smalltown, middle-class backdrop. This is the world of Aman Tripathi (Jitendra Kumar), who completes a happy family album with his mother, father and siblings. Aman is swept off his feet by Kartik Singh (Ayushmann Khurrana) and thus begins an affair that will leave his conservative family lost for words and reaction.

The struggle of the gay couple, as they try to convince their kin into acceptance, is played out with humour, but Kewalya's script credibly avoids getting flippant about it. Rather, as Aman's family go on a desperate matchmaking spree to hook him up with a girl, you realise the joke's on homophobia.

Being Kartik Singh has to be Ayushmann Khurrana's toughest challenge among the comedy films he has delivered lately, if only because playing the gay lover would seem at loggerheads with the essential idea that mainstream Bollywood harbours about heroism even in 2020. ""Shubh Mangal Saavdhan"" only marks the latest chapter in actor's continuing adventure with disrupting everything that defines the Bollywood hero, and he is clearly relishing every bit of it. But this isn't Ayushmann's best performance ever -- the film and its protagonist lack the nuances of ""Andhadhun"" or ""Article 15"".

For TVF sensation Jitendra Kumar, playing out Aman would seem like a perfect launch into the big screen space. Jitendra fans know him as a maverick of sorts in the web world where he so effortlessly impresses. He carries that understated screen presence into his act as Aman, a perfect Yin to Kartik's Yang.

The odd couple chemistry the two actors share owes itself to an authorbacked plot, but ""Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan"" wouldn't be the same without Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao either. The elderly ""Badhai Ho"" couple returns as Aman's parents. Primarily, their role is to convey shock in a world where it is still not considered ‘normal' to accept one's son as a gay person. Rao and Gupta have lost none of the comic timing edge that made ""Badhai Ho"" special. Delivering excellent acts individually, they also remain an asset for the film as a duo.

Rao and Gupta benefit from the fact that this film, like most of Aanand L. Rai's productions, sets up every character including the prop cast with a balance of the real and the entertaining. Proven talents as Manurishi Chaddha and Maanvi Gagroo, who play out vital cogs, also impress in interesting roles.

The film's biggest assets are its actors, along with the fact that it is among Bollywood's quirkiest shots at comedy ever. Putting the spotlight on homosexuality in a commercial set-up would also seem like a commendable effort at starting a wider conversation on the subject.

However, you get a finale that is not altogether unpredictable. Looking at the formulaic Bollywood love story through the prism of gay romance, the film also staunchly refuses to skim beneath the surface while addressing a subject as gay relationship, which has acquired topicality in our times.

That way, one could look at it as an opportunity lost, given the reach the film and its lead actor are bound to enjoy.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-shubh-mangal-zyada-saavdhan---shallow-but-fun--ians-review--rating---------2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/-shubh-mangal-zyada-saavdhan---shallow-but-fun--ians-review--rating--------.html
242,21-2-20,"Growing India, US defence trade strengthens bilateral ties: expert","Growing defence trade between India and the US has strengthened the relationship between the two countries, a top American expert has said, noting that much remains to be done for cooperation in this sector to reach its full potential.

In October, the Pentagon said the bilateral defence trade between the two countries is expected to reach USD 18 billion by the year end.

""Bilateral defence trade, essentially zero in 2008, will reach an estimated USD 18 billion later this year,"" Undersecretary Of Defense For Acquisition And Sustainment Ellen M Lord had told reporters head of the ninth India-US Defence Technologies and Trade Initiative or DTTI group meeting in New Delhi.

""The growing US-Indian defence trade has also strengthened the relationship between the two countries. India was once overly dependent on Russia for defence procurement, but in recent years, it has begun to purchase more high-tech defence goods from US suppliers,"" said Ashley J Tellis, who holds the Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs and is a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Writing in the Foreign Affairs magazine, Tellis in his column titled 'The Surprising Success of the US-Indian Partnership: Trump and Modi Have Deepened Defence Cooperation Against the Odds' said that although India can't accede to Trump's demand that it sever defence ties with Russia entirely, it has managed to become an important market for advanced American weapons.

""Currently, India hopes to purchase US antisubmarine and antitank warfare helicopters, advanced surface-to-air missiles, naval guns, unmanned aerial vehicles, and long-range maritime patrol aircraft. Deals for some of these may be announced during Trump's visit next week,"" Tellis wrote on Thursday.

Observing that the defence trade between the two countries is not without limits, he said weapons systems used to operate independently, making India's traditional a la carte approach to arms acquisition sustainable. The Indian defense inventory could, for example, consist of French fighter jets, Russian surface-to-air missiles, Israeli unmanned aerial vehicles, and European radars, he said.

But in an era of networked warfare, the United States and European nations (and private suppliers) balk at integrating their systems with those provided by strategic rivals, such as Russia.

Such considerations will either limit India's acquisition choices or compel it to settle for incomplete integration, forgoing the benefits of fully networked military systems, Tellis said.

""India's desire for defence-trade autonomy, in other words, is beginning to collide with the emerging realities of information-age warfare,"" he wrote.

India is not a US ally, but New Delhi has nonetheless moved proactively to pursue military activities that both advance its own interests vis-a-vis China and hold out the promise of reducing the burdens borne by US forces in the event of future crises or wars in India's extended neighbourhood, he adde

""For all the progress of recent years, much remains to be done for US-Indian defence cooperation to reach its full potential,"" Tellis said.

For starters, the Modi government needs to jump-start the flagging Indian economy, he said.

Slowing growth bodes ill for India's capacity to modernise its military fast enough to both balance out China's growing power in its neighbourhood and expand defence trade with the United States.

""India's woeful defence-procurement system also needs to be reformed. New Delhi treats defence acquisition as industrial and employment policy rather than as a mechanism for obtaining the military equipment its armed services need for operational success,"" he said.

The Indian military also needs to change its mindset from a frontier defence force to an expeditionary one capable of projecting power beyond the subcontinent, he said, adding that although it is competent and professional, it is still highly conservative.

Its technology, doctrine, and tactics are all driven mainly by the need to defend India's borders with China and Pakistan — making it a less capable US partner when it comes to providing security across the wider Indo-Pacific, he wrote.

""More than anything else, however, the future of the US-Indian defence relationship hinges on India's ability to maintain prosperity, stability, and social cohesion at home.

""An India that is distracted by internal strife, domestic cleavages, and corrosive ideological confrontations will be unable to either grow rapidly or modernise its military fast enough to project power beyond the Indian subcontinent,"" Tellis said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/growing-india--us-defence-trade-strengthens-bilateral-ties--expert-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/growing-india--us-defence-trade-strengthens-bilateral-ties--expert.html
243,21-2-20,No coronavirus case currently in India,"Ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit, India is currently completely free of coronavirus infection. Coronavirus infection was confirmed among 3 students from Kerala among Indian citizens present inside the country, but now all three students are completely healthy and have been discharged from hospital.

Screening for identification of coronavirus is going on in India on a large scale, but at present no other person has been found to be suffering from this disease in the screening of coronavirus. Significantly, more than two thousand people have died due to coronavirus in China and about 75,000 people are suffering from this disease.

The Union Health Ministry says that after thermal screening of millions of people, samples of a total of 2,654 people went for further investigation on the basis of suspicion.

Out of these 2,654 people, only three people from Kerala, who were found to be suffering from coronavirus, are now completely healthy.

Examining the remaining 2,651 people, they have been found to be completely safe from coronavirus. The test has been conducted at high-efficiency laboratories in Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi and Mumbai.

Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that ""India had begun its preparations for timely rescue of coronavirus. As many as 3,21,375 passengers of 2,296 aircraft have been screened. Also, 6,387 passengers of 125 ships have also been screened. None of these people are affected by the coronavirus"".

All 647 Indian nationals based in the ITBP's Delhi and Manesar camp of the Indian Army have also been sent home on suspicion of coronavirus. All these Indians have been brought to India from Wuhan city of China. Significantly, Wuhan is the only city in China where coronavirus outbreak has spread the most. Wuhan city of China has been completely closed for about 1 month. However, none of these Indians, who have been lodged in the ITBP camp, have been found to be suffering from coronavirus infection.

All these 647 suspects have spent more than 2 weeks in the Chawla camp of ITBP in outer Delhi. All the people living in the camp have been issued health certificate by the Ministry of Health.

All the Indians from China were regularly examined in these camps. Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said, ""Investigation has revealed that none of these Indians are affected by the coronavirus"".

The coronavirus infection that started in China's Wuhan city has now spread to 30 different states of China. Wuhan is the only state in China where most Indian students and other citizens are stranded. Most of the Indians returning home from China are students.

244,21-2-20,India hitting US,"India has been hitting the US ""very hard"" on trade for many years with high tariffs, according to President Donald Trump who said he will ""talk business"" with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his first visit to the country.

President Trump and First Lady Melania are scheduled to travel to Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi on February 24 and 25.

""I'm going to India next week and we're talking trade. They've been hitting us very hard for many, many years,"" Trump said at a 'Keep America Great' rally in Colorado on Thursday.

Trump told thousands of his supporters that he ""really likes"" Prime Minister Modi and they would be talking business.

""We've got to talk a little...We've got to talk a little business. It's been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs, one the highest in the world is India,"" he said.

Ahead of Trump's visit, there have been reports on India and the US agreeing on a trade package as a precursor to a major trade deal.

Downplaying the expectation of a trade deal with India during his visit, Trump said the two countries could make a ""tremendous"" trade deal, but indicated that the talks on this might slow down if he did not get a good deal.

""We're going to India, and we may make a tremendous deal there,"" Trump said in his commencement address at the Hope for Prisoners Graduation Ceremony in Las Vegas on Thursday.

""Maybe we'll slow down. We'll do it after the election. I think that could happen too. So, we'll see what happens,"" he said.

""But we're only making deals if they're good deals because we're putting America first. Whether people like it or not, we're putting America first,"" Trump said.

The bilateral India-US trade in goods and services is about three per cent of the US' world trade.

In a recent report, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) said the trading relationship is more consequential for India - in 2018 the US was its second largest goods export market (16.0 per cent share) after the European Union (EU, 17.8 per cent), and third largest goods import supplier (6.3 per cent) after China (14.6 per cent) and the EU 28 (10.2 per cent).

India is now the United States' eighth-largest trading partner in goods and services and is among the world's largest economies.

India's trade with the US now resembles, in terms of volume, America's trade with South Korea (USD 167 billion in 2018) or France (USD 129 billion), according to Council on Foreign Relations.

Trump spoke about his India visit at the Colorado rally and the grand welcome he is expected to get in the country.

""I hear, they are going to have 10 million people. They say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful,"" Trump said.

He said the ""Namaste Trump"" rally in Ahmedabad would spoil him.

""Prime Minister Modi said, we will have 10 million people greet you. Here's my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn't get in. It's going to look like peanuts from now on,"" he said.

""I'll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied when we fill up like a 60,000 seat stadium? I am getting spoiled? He said build a bigger stadium visit,"" Trump said.

One of his supporters from the audience suggested that he built a bigger stadium.

Trump indicated that his visit will result in more products ""proudly stamped with the beautiful phrase Made in the USA"".

During the address, the president reiterated his recent conversation with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who told him that he is the number one on Facebook.

""He (Zuckerberg) said, I just want to congratulate you. He said, you're number one in the world in Facebook. I said, no. I said, who's number two? He said, Prime Minister Modi of India,"" Trump said, adding that Modi has an advantage as he represents a larger population.

""I said, wait a minute, wait a minute. He's got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 (million). He should be number one, but we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, anything, and they (the press) still haven't figured it out. They have not figured it out. But look at all that press. Look at all that press,"" Trump said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-hitting-us--very-hard--on-trade--will-talk-business-with-pm-modi--trump-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/india-hitting-us--very-hard--on-trade--will-talk-business-with-pm-modi--trump.html
245,21-2-20,Pak likely to get four-month breather to fulfil FATF obligations,"Pakistan is likely to get four months to fulfil requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and secure an exit from its grey list.

A decision to this effect was likely to be taken by the FATF on Friday after the conclusion of the February 16-21 group meetings and plenary in Paris. The Pakistani delegation to the meetings was led by Revenue Minister Hammad Azhar.

The FATF in October decided to keep Pakistan on its 'Grey' list for failure to curb funnelling of funds to terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and others.

If not removed off the list by April, Pakistan may move to a blacklist of countries that face severe economic sanctions, such as Iran.

According to a report in the Dawn newspaper, the international terror financing watchdog was set to give Pakistan time till June 2020 to achieve full compliance with its 27-point action plan and secure exit from the FATF grey list.

Sources from Paris said that Pakistan was found fully or close to fully compliant on more than half of the 27 targets.

“We are satisfied with the progress so far. There was no case at all for blacklisting us,” a source was quoted as saying in the report.

Pakistan is already finalising major amendments to at least a dozen of its laws to meet the FATF requirements by June this year.

Based on that, the country's performance would be judged in the next FATF plenary in October 2020, the report said.

Pakistan submitted a 650-page review report to the FATF on January 8. The report was submitted in response to 150 questions raised by the FATF regarding new Pakistani policies on money laundering. The report outlined the steps taken by Pakistan between October 2019 to January 2020 to implement the group's recommendations.

In January, Pakistan urged the US to support its bid to exit from FATF's grey list ahead of a key meeting of the international terror financing watchdog in Beijing in which Islamabad's efforts to adopt stricter laws against terror financing and money laundering were scrutinised.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pak-likely-to-get-four-month-breather-to-fulfil-fatf-obligations-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pak-likely-to-get-four-month-breather-to-fulfil-fatf-obligations.html
246,21-2-20,"Death toll in China's coronavirus jumps to 2,236; confirmed cases cross 75,400","The death toll in China's novel coronavirus has gone up to 2,236 with 118 more deaths reported, mostly from the hard-hit Hubei province, while the overall confirmed infection cases have climbed to 75,465, Chinese health officials said on Friday.

The number of deaths is higher than the previous day when 114 people died of the disease, but the country reported the lowest number of new infection cases in nearly a month, fuelling hopes that Beijing's epidemic control efforts were working.

By the end of Thursday, a total of 2,236 people had died of the disease and 75,465 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection had been reported from 31 provincial-level regions and in China, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in its daily report on Friday.

In all 118 deaths and 889 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection were reported from all over the country, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Another 1,614 new suspected cases were reported on Thursday and 5,206 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus, the NHC said.

Among the deaths, 115 were from the epicentre of the virus Hubei province and one in Zhejiang, Chongqing and Yunnan, respectively, it said.

Also 18,264 patients infected with the novel coronavirus have been discharged from hospitals after recovery by the end of Thursday.

Hubei Province, centre of the novel coronavirus outbreak, reported 411 new confirmed cases and 115 new deaths on Thursday, according to the provincial health commission Friday.

The latest report brought the total confirmed cases in the hard-hit province to 62,442. Wuhan, the provincial capital, recorded a total of 45,346 confirmed cases.

Among the 42,056 hospitalised patients, 8,979 were still in severe condition and another 2,018 in critical condition, the local health commission said.

The province also saw 1,451 patients discharged from hospital after recovery on Thursday, bringing the total number of discharged patients in the province to 11,788, it said.

By the end of Thursday, 68 confirmed cases including two deaths had been reported in Hong Kong ,10 confirmed cases in Macao, and 24 in Taiwan including one death.

Meanwhile, Beijing saw a sudden spike in the cases after the central city hospital reported 36 novel coronavirus infections as of Thursday, a sharp increase from nine cases from two weeks earlier, leading many to fear a potential explosion of infection numbers in the capital, the state-run Global Times daily reported.

Among the infected at Fuxing Hospital in Xicheng district were eight medical workers, nine cleaning staff and 19 patients along with their families, the report said.

""Considering 36 confirmed cases were found in Fuxing Hospital, it is more about one case of multiple infections rather than an epidemic of the whole area,"" Wang Guangfa, director of the department of respiratory and critical care medicine at Peking University First Hospital said.

Another major hospital, Peking University People's Hospital, on Thursday, for the first time, reported confirmed cases of infection.

Three patients at the hospital were confirmed to have the novel coronavirus on February 17.

As of Wednesday, Beijing had confirmed 395 cases of novel coronavirus infection, with four deaths.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fewer-virus-cases-in-china--but-deaths-abroad-increase-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/death-toll-in-china-s-coronavirus-jumps-to-2-236--confirmed-cases-cross-75-400.html
247,21-2-20,Voting underway in Iran parliamentary election,"Iranians began voting Friday in a parliamentary election which conservatives are expected to dominate, capitalising on public anger against moderate conservative President Hassan Rouhani over a ravaged economy, corruption and multiple crises.

State television showed the Islamic republic's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei casting the first ballot in Tehran.

As he voted, Khamenei called on all Iranians to take part in the election ""as soon as possible,"" saying that doing so would ""guarantee the country's national interests"".

The 11th parliamentary election since the 1979 Islamic Revolution comes after steeply escalating tensions between Iran and the United States and the accidental downing of a Ukrainian airliner that sparked anti-government protests.

Experts predict a low turnout with rising voter apathy that they say will serve the conservatives at the expense of Rouhani, who was re-elected in 2017 promising more freedoms and the benefits of engagement with the West.

Iran has been hit by an economic slump and high inflation following harsh US sanctions after President Donald Trump pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal with Tehran in 2018.

""Iran's biggest problem is not having stability, peace and calm,"" said Amir Mohtasham, who is 38 and jobless.

""Our elections are useless. Even the current parliament has 90 sitting MPs who are under investigation for financial corruption,"" he said.

Nearly 58 million people are eligible to vote.

Around half of the 16,033 hopefuls will contest the 290 seats up for grabs across 31 provinces after the Guardian Council barred thousands of would-be candidates, mostly moderates and reformists.

On Thursday, Washington slapped sanctions on five Iranian officials in charge of vetting candidates, including Ahmad Jannati, a powerful cleric.

""The Trump administration will not tolerate the manipulation of elections to favour the regime's malign agenda,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

The Guardian Council slammed the sanctions, saying they showed the United States' disdain for democracy.

""America's regime has shown through illegal sanctions... On members of the Guardian Council that it has nothing to do with democracy,"" said its spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee, who was among those hit with sanctions.

""We are now even more determined to safeguard the people's vote,"" he tweeted.

On the eve of the elections, state media aired a short clip showing votes transforming into torpedoes hitting enemy navy ships closing in on Iran.

Hessameddin Ashena, Rouhani's main adviser, warned on Twitter that abstention ""increases (among other things) the possibility of a military aggression"".

Turnout in Iran's past 10 elections averaged 60.5 percent, according to the interior ministry.

The Guardian Council said it expected at least 50 percent of registered voters to cast ballots.

Many voters, however, have voiced disinterest.

""We voted for Mr Rouhani with a dream, and then we didn't achieve anything. So, in my opinion, people are not hopeful any more,"" said Mohammed, who spoke from his carpet shop and only gave one name.

""I honestly don't want to vote, because it won't fix our problems and is of no use, and this election is only a formality just so they can show to the world that they are chosen by the nation, while it is not so,"" said Pari Aghazadeh, a fashion designer.

In November, demonstrations over petrol price hikes spread across Iran and turned violent before being crushed in a deadly crackdown.

Tehran and Washington have nearly gone to war twice in the past seven months, most recently after the US assassinated prominent Iranian general Qasem Soleimani on January 3.

The ""martyrdom"" of the hugely popular general provoked an outpouring of grief in Iran.

Millions of people turned out to mourn his death, but that unity suffered a blow after Iran finally admitted that it had shot down a Ukrainian airliner on January 8, killing 176 people.

The government sparked further anger by denying for several days that Iran was to blame, before owning up to a jittery reaction by a missile operator.

The disaster unfolded as Iran's defences were on high alert in case the US retaliated to Iranian strikes hours earlier on American troops stationed in Iraq in response to the killing of Soleimani.

Voting for the parliament, or Majles, lasts 10 hours but can be extended. Final results are not expected before Sunday.

Apart from the parliament, voters will also choose replacements for deceased members of the Assembly of Experts, a 88-strong clerical body that appoints and monitors the supreme leader.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/voting-underway-in-iran-parliamentary-election-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/voting-underway-in-iran-parliamentary-election.html
248,21-2-20,South Korea coronavirus cases jump to 156 as sect infections spike,"South Korea confirmed 52 more cases of novel coronavirus on Friday as the number of infections linked to a religious sect in Daegu spiked, making it the worst-affected country outside China.

Thirty-nine of the new cases were connected to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southern city of Daegu, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said, taking the country's overall figure to 156.

More than 80 members of Shincheonji have now been infected, starting with a 61-year-old woman who developed a fever on February 10 but attended at least four church services before being diagnosed.

The mayor of Daegu -- South Korea's fourth-biggest city, with a population of over 2.5 million -- has advised locals to stay indoors, while access to a major US military base in the area has been restricted.

The streets remained active Friday with most people wearing masks, but many businesses were closed due to the outbreak.

Workers on motorcycles sprayed disinfectant outside the Shincheonji church in the city, where passer-by Seo Dong-min, 24, told AFP: ""With so many confirmed cases here I'm worried that Daegu will become the second Wuhan,"" referring to the Chinese city where the virus first emerged.

Shincheonji is often accused of being a cult and claims its founder, Lee Man-hee, has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on the day of judgement.

But with more church members than places in heaven available, they are said to have to compete for slots and pursue converts persistently and secretively.

The KCDC said one more virus case had been confirmed at a hospital in Cheongdo county near Daegu where a total of 16 infections have now been identified, including a long-stay patient who died Wednesday after showing symptoms of pneumonia.

Cheongdo is the birthplace of Shincheonji's founder Lee, and county officials said a three-day funeral was held for his brother three weeks ago at a hall owned by the hospital.

President Moon Jae-in called for a ""thorough investigation"" of everyone who attended the funeral and Shincheonji services.

""If you simply rely on the information provided by the church, the process can be slow,"" he told a cabinet meeting. ""We need faster measures.""

Daegu's renowned Mijin restaurant, which has been in business for over 40 years, has closed, with a notice reading: ""For your safety, we are suspending the business until coronavirus-19 is under control. We wish you and your family good health.""

And Lee Yoo-jin, 73, who runs a dress shop in the city centre, told AFP: ""I have not had a single customer this week. I have run the shop for over 20 years and never have I seen such a drop.""

Daegu's mayor Kwon Young-jin said the local government had surveyed 3,700 Shincheonji members and 409 said they were experiencing symptoms.

Some residents expressed frustration, with a passer-by at the church saying authorities should have closed a nearby subway station for cleaning.

""Now it's all over the place,"" said the woman, surnamed Kim. ""It's too late now."" The central government on Friday declared Daegu and Cheongdo ""special management zones"".

Seoul will support the region with medical personnel, beds and equipment, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said, and the cabinet will meet three times a week to discuss the outbreak.

The US army garrison in Daegu -- where around 10,000 soldiers, civilians and family members live or work -- has restricted access and instructed any American troops who recently attended Shincheonji services to self-quarantine.

""Travel in and around Daegu is highly discouraged unless absolutely necessary,"" the garrison said Thursday in a Facebook post.

""Please avoid public places and public transportation, to include stores, restaurants, subways and other heavily congested areas."" Shincheonji has closed all its facilities nationwide.

""We are deeply sorry that because of one of our members, who thought of her condition as a cold because she had not travelled abroad, led to many in our church being infected and thereby caused concern to the local community,"" it said in a statement.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/south-korea-coronavirus-cases-jump-to-156-as-sect-infections-spike-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/south-korea-coronavirus-cases-jump-to-156-as-sect-infections-spike.html
249,21-2-20,Google removes 600 'disruptive' apps from Play Store,"Google has removed nearly 600 ""disruptive"" Android apps from its Play Store, along with banning their developers who tricked users to click on ads.

According to the company, one area of focus for the Ads team is developing new ways to detect disruptive ads shown outside of the app - for example, out-of-context ads from an app not currently in use.

""This behaviour violates Google policies, so Google removes these apps from both AdMob and Play Store,"" the company said in a statement late Thursday.

""Our investigations are ongoing and when we find violations we will continue to take action,"" Google added.

According to Scott Spencer, VP, Product Management, Google Ads, one of the biggest threats to ad-supported content is ad fraud, a pervasive issue for users, developers, and advertisers alike.

""Google blacklisted numerous bad actors that were found to be committing large scale invalid traffic and ad fraud, which violates Google policies,"" said Spencer.

In 2019, Google removed tens of thousands of apps and developers that were found to be in violation of its policies.

""Taking corrective action was an imperative step in protecting advertiser dollars, leveling the playing field for legitimate publishers, and removing bad app experiences for users,"" said the tech giant.

As industry regulations evolve, Google is providing tools for app publishers to manage their compliance strategy, maintain user trust, and minimise the risk of losing revenue.

""Android is making fundamental platform changes to minimise interruptions in app experiences and keep the user more in control of what's shown on their screen,"" informed Google.

In addition to fighting ad fraud, the Google Play and Ads teams both announced new steps to help ensure that ad content served in apps for children is appropriate for their intended users.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/google-removes-600--disruptive--apps-from-play-store-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/google-removes-600--disruptive--apps-from-play-store.html

India were 122 for 5 at tea after Kane Williamson won the toss and elected to field at the Basin Reserve.

252,21-2-20,You never feel set as a batsman on Basin Reserve's tricky track: Agarwal,"Indian opener Mayank Agarwal on Friday said the tricky Basin Reserve wicket was very difficult to negotiate for the visiting batsmen and what made it worse was debutant New Zealand seamer Kyle Jamieson's ""terrific"" consistency on the opening day of the first Test here.

Agarwal (34) was the only batsman, apart from vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane (38 batting), who was able to counter the New Zealand seamers as India scored 122 for five in the rain-marred first day.

""I think it is quite tricky since the wind blows at more than a decent speed here. And you just have to make adjustments right there on the field. As a batsman, it's not easy, especially first day, on this track,"" said Agarwal, who survived the first session only to get out after lunch.

""As a batsman, you never felt that you were completely in because even after lunch, it was doing a little bit.""

Agarwal praised Jamieson's effort, saying he was impressed with the way he mixed it up.

""I thought he (Jamieson) bowled exceedingly well. He hit good areas and he got good bounce. The way he used the new ball was fantastic and he kept testing us bowling in the right areas.

""Since the wicket was soft, he was getting extra kick as well. As a batsman, you have to make that little extra adjustment to the bounce, which can be a little tricky,"" explained the opener.

The 29-year-old from Karnataka felt it was a combination of both spongy surface and disconcerting bounce which made life miserable for him and his colleagues.

""It is a combination of both. With that height on this wicket, with the areas and the consistency he showed, it was terrific,"" he said referring to the 6""8' Jamieson.

In the post-lunch session, Agarwal didn't get strike for some time but he didn't want to attribute his dismissal to lapse of concentration.

""I don't really think about all of those things while I am batting. If you are playing well and if you are addressing the ball well, it's fine. It really doesn't matter, especially in these conditions. It's alright to be at the non-striker's end,"" he said with a dash of humour.

Awareness of the conditions is also one aspect that Agarwal wanted to focus on as his mode of dismissal had a lot to do with not being able to gauge the speed of the wind while playing the pull shot.

""That is definitely something we spoke about after I came back. You definitely want to be aware of the conditions while playing.""

Four out of five dismissed Indian batsmen were done in by fuller deliveries but Agarwal did not think that it was the pitched up ones which created trouble.

""No, it's not like only the fuller deliveries will be effective. If you keep pitching it up, it becomes easier for the batsmen. You have to mix up your areas but you still have to be consistent that you attack at the right time,"" he said.

""In an over, you can't attack with all six deliveries. Bowl three to four balls in good areas and then if you feel that you can get the batsman out, then you attack,"" he dissected how New Zealand and, especially Jamieson, operated.

In a roundabout manner, he admitted that there was not much help for the spinners and their job will be to bowl tight lines.

""I didn't play the spinner but I think as a bowler or as a bowling unit, we have to be consistent and very tight on this wicket,"" he said.

He didn't want to predict a good first innings score that will give confidence to his bowlers but hoped that Ajinkya Rahane can bat as long as possible with Rishabh Pant giving him support.

""To be honest, as many runs that we can make and as long as we can bat, it will be good for us.

""The way Ajinkya is batting is very good (for us). He is looking solid and I really hope that him and Rishabh can get a big partnership and take us to a big score,"" he said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/you-never-feel-set-as-a-batsman-on-basin-reserve-s-tricky-track--agarwal-2020-02-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/you-never-feel-set-as-a-batsman-on-basin-reserve-s-tricky-track--agarwal.html
