0,06-3-20,Collateral damage,"Consumers will be left with high tariffs and a poorer and older technology telecom network if Vodafone Idea fails to make it through

The country may take a multi-billion dollar hit besides a deep dent on its reputation as a safe place to invest in the eventuality of Vodafone Idea exiting the market. Vodafone Idea, which once was referred to as the most prized and promising asset in the Vodafone group’s operating markets, is now looking at a bankruptcy procedure in India. At the heart of it all is a princely sum of $3.9 billion in adjusted gross revenues it immediately has to deposit with the Government, over a dispute on definitions spanning nearly two decades in various courts of the country. This potential exit is likely to have a lasting negative impact on the Indian economy and most importantly the nearly 300 million consumers of the company. This may smother an already crumbling telecom sector into a duopoly market with just Airtel and Reliance Jio left in the fray. State-run telecom companies Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) jointly have a less than 10 per cent market share in the highly-competitive telecom market and have been surviving on Government economic packages for years.

A duopoly market would be a disaster for telecom equipment vendors and tower companies operating in the country. There are four large network equipment firms, which have an exposure of nearly half a billion dollars in dues towards Vodafone Idea. Recovering dues from the service provider will be a challenge for these vendors as the court proceedings arising out of bankruptcy procedures may take a significant amount of time. Meanwhile, a market with just two addressable telecom service clients is likely to see an exit or substantial scaling down of the four equipment suppliers’ business operations.

This, along with the economic slowdown that the country is witnessing, will deliver a body blow to the job market in the telecom sector. Vodafone Idea has nearly 13,500 employees on its payrolls and employs another 1,00,000 indirectly through its operations. This means nearly 1.5 lakh job losses in a sector which has seen two large players, namely Reliance Communications and Aircel, exit in recent years. Add to this, the fate of a multinational tower company American Tower Corporation (ATC), which has spent nearly $1 billion in acquiring Vodafone’s standalone towers in the past. Vodafone Idea going belly up would mean ATC would have to switch off 20,000 towers.

Incidentally, each tower provides livelihood opportunities to nearly four to five people, whose jobs are in jeopardy now. A similar fate awaits other tower companies like Indus, as their tenancies or number of operators beaming from each tower is likely to be reduced. Vodafone Idea currently beams from close to 2,00,000 towers covering all telecom zones, many of which are via shared resources, with Airtel sharing half the cost of a tower. A shutdown will take away Vodafone’s signals from these shared towers leading to cost increase for a single tenant (in this case mostly Airtel), as well as switching off for other towers. That would be an additional blow on employment.

A major portion of the collateral damage, however, will have to be borne by the over 300 million customers of Vodafone Idea, who will have to find a new service provider out of the two left in the market. Accommodating a customer network nearly the size of the entire European subscriber base will be a technological challenge for remaining operators. Analysts point to a nearly 15-20 per cent increase in operational expenses for Airtel due to reversal in existing tower-sharing agreements. The companies will have to invest heavily in augmenting their network capacity to accommodate the expected surge of customers. Many analysts point that the remaining two operators will have to, in a short span, deploy nearly 2,00,000 towers and get additional nodes for fibre network.

The quality of the telecom network, which already has a dubious reputation in the country will go down further. The cost of services, the cheapest data and voice calls in the world right now (1 Gigabytes of data at around $0.20, with voice calls being almost free) will go up. Already telecom operators, including Vodafone Idea, have announced a nearly 50 per cent hike in select tariff plans and in the likelihood of two players remaining, the bargaining chip available to consumers would be gone.

The Government, like telecom vendors and consumers, will have to silently bear the brunt of a two-player market. This also constrains Indian consumers from upgrading to fifth generation or 5G telecom technology at par with their counterparts in 80 plus countries. Having joined the race early, India had expressed the desire to be a global leader in the 5G technology deployment for providing high-speed wireless broadband services to its citizens. This multi-billion-dollar, new capacity addition and upgrade to faster technology may now be left crippled, with the only two players left in the fray, reluctant to make fresh investments. In the end, Indian consumers will be left with high tariffs and a poorer and older technology telecom network in case Vodafone Idea fails to make it through.

1,06-3-20,Ignore the ramblings of a ‘sick mind’,"While a US publication printed an offensive article, many US-funded enterprises and charities provided China with aid for epidemic prevention and more than 20 countries gave emergency materials to it, says Long Xingchun

China is under attack by the Coronavirus. As the Chinese Government and people are battling this epidemic, governments and people around the world have expressed their sympathies and support to the nation. Many countries have extended help by providing China with a large number of material for epidemic prevention. However, some individuals in some countries maliciously referred to the virus as “Wuhan virus” and “China virus” on social media.

A mainstream US media publication even printed an article under the headline China is the real sick man of Asia. The article also downgraded China’s economic outlook. Some senior US officials even claimed that the outbreak in China would help bring jobs back to America.

The history of human development is one of constant battle with infectious diseases that have caused massive casualties. In ancient society, due to poor transportation and communication, people moved around in a limited area, thus restricting the geographical scope of infection. For example, the Black Death that occurred in Europe in the 14 century caused more than 25 million deaths, wiping out almost a third of the European population at that time. When that happened, let alone be infected, Asia, Africa and the US did not even know about the epidemic.

With the development of science and technology, as well as new means of transportation such as steam engines, came the global mobility of human beings. The emergence of airplanes, in particular, enabled people to travel from the eastern hemisphere to the western hemisphere and from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere within half a day. While enjoying the convenience, people also had to bear the concurrent negative influences, such as the rapid spread of diseases worldwide, which no country can cope with single-handedly. What is needed is global governance through all nations in the world working together. The concept of “saving others is saving ourselves” is deeply-rooted in people’s hearts, resulting in the formation of a community of shared destiny in public health. When a major natural disaster or severe epidemic hit a country, aid and help flow in from all over the world.

For instance, China’s medical team has made outstanding contributions to the fight against Ebola in Africa. China is also an important contributor to the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) funding, fulfilling its responsibility as a major country for international health cooperation and human health improvement.

Infectious diseases are often transmitted all over the world. In many cases, it is difficult to identify the original source. Anyone, regardless of race, may fall victim to the infection. Therefore, it is not fair to equate any infectious disease with a specific country or race. Any attempt to name the naturally-occurring viruses after a country or city will only encounter protests. The Ebola virus was not called the “African virus”. The seasonal flu that infected millions of Americans and killed thousands of them was not called the “American flu” either. Nor has any foreign Government or media called the US a “sick man”, let alone blaming the US political system for its occurrence. Linking a virus with a specific country or city, or attacking the country that is combatting the epidemic, is not only a display of ignorance about the disease but it is also a racist discrimination and denial of the epidemic-control effort of the country in question. It undermines the cooperation of the international community to fight against infectious diseases. People doing such deeds are the real “sick-minded” ones.

The article that described China as “the real sick man of Asia”, has not only been condemned by the Chinese Government and people but has also been widely opposed and slammed by people with a conscience around the world, including the US.

Catherine Ceniza Choy, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, Berkeley, criticised the article saying, “This is extremely harmful and wrong” arguing that the consequences of publishing an opinion like this include stoking fear and anxiety and increasing hostility against the Chinese and other Asians throughout the world.

The White House website has received more than 100,000 signed petitions asking the publication for an apology. Many people wrote directly to accuse the author of the article, Walter Russell Mead. But Mead said that the headline was given by the newspaper editor and he had nothing to do with it. It is clear that Mead has already recognised the offensive nature of his piece.

The Chinese Government and people do not need to overly worry about individuals or views attacking China, nor should they be distracted. There are people with extreme ideologies in each and every country who are vicious and arrogant. However, their views can never become the viewpoint of the mainstream.

While the US publication printed such an offensive article, US-funded enterprises and charities provided China with a large amount of aid for epidemic prevention as quickly as they possibly could. Many Americans expressed sympathies and support to Beijing.

More than 20 countries, including Japan, South Korea, Russia, Singapore and Pakistan, provided emergency materials to aid China. In Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister led a countrywide prayer to invoke blessings for China and Lankan Cabinet Ministers joined in giving donations.

The Union of the Comoros, a tiny African nation, one of the least developed, has given China a symbolic gift of 100 euros. It’s not a lot, but it means a lot. Governments of many countries and the WHO have recognised the measures taken by the Chinese Government to respond to the epidemic and acknowledged the sacrifices and contributions made by China to prevent the epidemic from spreading globally. In the battle against the epidemic, China is not alone.

2,06-3-20,Win over thy neighbour,"Given the freeze in the relations between India and Nepal, it is time for New Delhi to engage with Naya Nepal in a way that it is assured of the sincerity of its words

Soon after the peaceful conclusion of the civil war in Nepal in 2006, several political observers were of the view that it be referred to as “Naya Nepal.” Naya, a Hindi-Nepali term, refers to a “new” nation that emerged at the cost of 17,000 lives after a decade-long civil war. Changes primarily included the ouster of the centuries-old monarchy and Nepal’s transition into a democratic State, where the king was no more considered to be the sole administrator/protector, the restructuring of the country from a Hindu State to a secular one, the inclusion of the Maoist guerrilla fighters into the mainstream political process, reinstating of the multi-party political system and providing political freedom and adult franchise to the people.

Naya Nepal also faced the challenge of writing a democratic Constitution, giving justice to families who had lost their loved ones during the civil war, maintaining political stability, narrowing the thaw between the Pahadi and Madhesi groups and improving the state of the economy, which was in a shambles due to the war. While the civil war affected the internal structure of the country, it had an enormous impact on its foreign policy, especially towards India. It is often believed that Nepal, a country that falls between the two Asian giants, India and China, has been a ground for competition between them to strengthen their influence, precisely due to its strategic location. While China aims to focus on protecting its interests in Tibet, India wants a stable neighbour. Traditionally, India has been a friend of Nepal. The India-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship, signed in 1950, recognises the “special relationship” shared between them. The uniqueness of this pact is characterised by open borders, free movement of people, deeply rooted socio-cultural ties and people-to-people relations.

However, with a change in its internal structure, there has been a change in the thought process of the new regime. Today, Nepal’s narrative is so-called nationalistic, extreme and abhors pro-India sentiments. The anti-India tirade among the Nepalese population is not new. Despite all efforts to improve bilateral relations, distances have only grown. It is here that sincere engagement is essential to reduce differences.

Need for a template: The anti-India sentiment is acutely “political” and has become a part of everyday life, where a daily dose of dislike is being given to the Nepalese population, based on selective information. While in the past, several attempts were made to isolate Nepal from India, in the last five years, differences have become grave.

During several democratic movements in Nepal, in 1960, 1990 and 2006, India played the role of a well-wisher to bridge the gap between the erstwhile monarchy and the democratic forces. Amid these natural ties, a fallout in the relations is not unnatural, considering the nature of interaction between the two countries in the last five years.

The beginning: The year 2014 was promising for India-Nepal relations for two reasons. One, Nepal was the second neighbouring country Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited after taking charge in August 2014. This was also the first bilateral trip by an Indian Prime Minister to the Himalayan nation in 17 years. This signalled the priority the new Government accorded to better the strained relationship with Nepal. Then again, the Prime Minister returned to Kathmandu in November 2014, to attend the 18th Annual Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). This summit was another opportunity for India to minimise the existing trust deficit with Nepal and other regional neighbours.

Second, the two countries revised their diplomatic channels of communication. This was indeed a strong message for other competitive powers that India would continue to maintain its goodwill and developmental works in Nepal. India’s swift despatch of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams to Nepal during the 2015 earthquake to carry out rescue operations in affected areas was a major friendly operation. Later, India’s financial assistance to Nepal for relief and reconstruction of the damaged property showcased the “naturalness” of its relation with Nepal.

Blockade: In September 2015, the Constituent Assembly of Nepal promulgated a new democratic-republican Constitution. This happened seven years after Nepal’s transformation into a democracy. While Kathmandu rejoiced the hasty completion of a new Constitution, issues like the rights of women, demarcation of the federal boundaries and marginalisation of the Madhesis took a violent turn. As a result, movement of goods and people were obstructed due to violence and arson at the India-Nepal border.

Nepal was quick to call it an India-imposed blockade, which was outrightly rejected by the latter. This saw a heated discussion in the Upper House of the Indian Parliament and was categorised as the biggest national emergency in Nepal. The alleged blockade was used as a tool to influence masses in Nepal during the 2017 local and 2018 national elections, too. Since then, the blockade has become an issue of national emergency in the neighbouring country.

Threat perception: In 2016, Nepal implemented its first National Security Policy (NSP). While the then Nepali Congress-led Government hesitated to use blockade as a national security threat, the present KP Oli-led Government has amended the NSP and categorised “blockade” as a national security threat. It needs to be mentioned here that through the 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship, New Delhi had assured Kathmandu that it would not face any external aggression on its part. In the past 65 years of diplomatic interactions, Nepal has felt secure. Therefore, Kathmandu’s sudden change on matters of mutual security is worrying because it has more political connotations rather than a will to resolve issues.

Cutting people-to-people ties: The updated National Security Policy 2019 under the Communist regime in Nepal has not yet been made public and it is believed that it is the use of the term “blockade” that has ruffled feathers in New Delhi. Meanwhile, during an interaction, an advisor to the Nepalese Prime Minister indicated that Nepal intends to regulate its borders. The word “regulate” incorporates limiting the transit points at what has been a largely open border, establishing a dedicated Border Security Force and treating travelling through land routes at par with air routes in terms of document requirements for citizens of the two countries.

Nepal may well cite security reasons for these upcoming upgradations but this will impact the movement of people from the bordering regions. Notably, people-to-people contact cannot be established between the two countries, a move that seems to be acceding to China’s request. While India and Nepal enjoy natural people-to-people relations, restrictions on the free movement will come at a cost to India.

Border disputes: Last November, Nepal objected to the release of a new map of India. It said that the boundaries in the Kalapani region were shown wrongly and sent diplomatic notes to New Delhi. India clarified that in no way does “the new map revisit boundaries with Nepal.” It still maintains this position on the issue. The two countries have resolved 98 per cent of border disputes. The Indian side believes that an objection on Kalapani, too, can be resolved diplomatically. However, this does not seem to be the case in Nepal.

Eminent persons group: In 2016, the two countries appointed an Eminent Persons Group (EPG), consisting of relevant experts from India and Nepal, to review bilateral treaties and agreements between the two countries, including the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship. While the group has submitted its report with recommendations to both Governments, it remains under wraps. Reasons are unknown but it stands as a ticking bomb for India. The EPG report may not be a critical issue for us but it is a matter of national prestige for Nepal. Not making it public will put all the blame on India.

In international relations, diplomacy is considered to be the first and the last best resort to resolve bilateral or multilateral issues. India may have assured full diplomatic support to Nepal. However, until these issues are part of the political mandate, the present challenges cannot be resolved. From a foreign policy perspective, Naya Nepal is more challenging and complex for India. The alleged border blockade, the Madhesi movement and now the Kalapani dispute have all become part of our neighbour’s national narrative which is undoubtedly hateful and extreme. While all is not lost for the two countries, the increasing presence of China in Nepal and pending bilateral issues between New Delhi and Kathmandu require the best efforts from India’s side.

3,06-3-20,The super club,"IITs, IIMs & DU have made it to the world top 100 rankings in subjects but we should crack the institutional charts too

In a general global atmosphere of gloom and doom, here’s a bit of good news for India. As many as 26 departments of higher educational institutions in the country feature among the top 100 in the world in their respective categories. According to the latest edition of the World University Rankings by Subject, 26 have made it to the top 100 and two of them even figured in the global top 50. Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) calculates performance of institutions of higher education based on four parameters — research impact, productivity of the research faculty, academic reputation and employer reputation. Significantly, all the departments to figure in the list are in Central Government-run institutions, the usual top performers — IITs, IIMs, IISc and the Delhi University. IIT Bombay has nine programmes, IIT Delhi has five among the top 100, while IIT Kharagpur, IIT Madras and IISc Bangalore have recorded three programmes each. The subjects featuring the highest levels of Indian representation are chemistry (20 universities); computer science and information systems (20); physics and astronomy (18); biological sciences (16); electrical engineering (15) and chemical engineering (14). But before we start celebrating, consider this: We have a whopping 993 universities, 51,649 higher educational institutions and 14.16 lakh teaching staff at the last count in September 2019. Given these mind-boggling numbers, we should have had more than 26 departments in the QS rankings. This suggests that there is something intrinsically wrong with our higher education system. What else can explain the fact that 80 per cent of our 2.9 million science and engineering graduates are unemployable? It’s a sad reflection on our pedagogy skills if less than one per cent of the 1.5 million engineers, who enter the job market every year, are hired by the top 100 companies. There are constant complaints from industries that there is a major gap in what is being taught at our professional institutions and the skills required in the real world. And this is not just restricted to technical education.

So how do we change this dismal scenario? For starters, we need to invest more in research. When was the last time that innovations or path-breaking solutions emerged from Indian academic research? An increased focus on globalisation of curriculum and methods of instruction is needed so that our students become participants in the global economy. We also need to increase Government spending in higher education so that we can build better infrastructure, improve methods of research and hire world-class faculty that encourages a higher order of thinking, innovation, problem-solving, critical thinking and client handling. Though this year’s Budget saw a five per cent increase in allocation for education, up from Rs 94,800 crore last year to Rs 99,300 crore, the fact remains that our spending is lower than world standards. In fact, it has remained almost stagnant over the last eight years. Besides, among public universities, around 97 per cent of our students go to those at the State level while the remaining three per cent make it to Central universities. Yet 57.5 per cent of the Government’s higher education Budget goes to Central universities, IITs and IIMs. State universities also need funds and resources. Given this scenario, it is sad that Indian firms donate heavily to foreign universities as they feel they will get better returns by investing there. It is vital to develop a synergy between the Government, the industry and universities as big business houses are much more likely to invest in higher education if they derive value in terms of an excellent workforce and a knowledge pool. A separate research assessment body must be set up to regulate recruitment and appraisal standards. Also, stronger intellectual property protection must be enforced to encourage innovation and partnerships with the industry. Only then can we ensure that more of our universities improve their global ranking and often appear in the top 200 list.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-super-club-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-super-club.html
4,06-3-20,Transparent tenders,"NITI Aayog plans to review norms, particularly in the L1 category, to ensure quality and equal opportunity for players

Faster, better or cheaper, pick any two” is the mantra followed by most businesses in assessing the most viable deals. But most Government departments in India have for decades prioritised the “cheaper” over the “better” while giving out contracts, an approach which has impacted the quality of the task executed. In the end, most departments have ended up looking penny wise but pound foolish. Our tender process is askew with a notice appearing in leading newspapers inviting offers with technical and commercial specifications. The vetting committees screen them, shortlist vendors and then evaluate them on the basis of their commercial bids. The lowest of the commercial offers (L1) is selected and awarded the tender. In other words, you compromise quality on the service rendered, the equipment and talent used in doing so and the completed product. Quality comes at a price, simply because it’s calculated on the basis of established industry parameters and is not open to subjective assessment or manipulated mindsets. The L1 system has, therefore, always raised questions about the credibility of our selection processes and resulted in criticism and questioning by other bidders. Sometimes, these have led to legal proceedings and stalling of the tender itself. This is why the NITI Aayog is mulling a plan to review tendering norms, particularly in the L1 category, to ensure transparency and equal opportunity for all players. Often transnational companies argue that it is difficult to cut costs for their equipment that are not manufactured in India and, therefore, lose out on many of our projects that could have done better with their expertise. Most global tenders, therefore, follow a quality-based selection process (QBS) where the emphasis is on securing the most competent candidate and where higher weightage is given to the technical proposals. There is the more practical quality cost-based selection process (QCBS), where both the technical and financial proposals are used to determine the winning submission. The idea is to identify the strongest technical proposal at the best price. Telecom technology procurement on the lowest-bid method has cost us as PSUs don’t get time-tested products from market leaders in the segment.

The norms need to be reviewed simply because far too many players come up courtesy online bidding processes. With many parties to choose from, the organisation concerned, through the L1 benchmark, tries to take the competitive cost advantage and dilutes all other deciding factors. Often, a supplier makes an aggressive bid, quoting an unimaginable price that does not even cover the cost of production or promises a very slim profit margin. This is done to ensure good testimonials in the market. Once the deal is sealed, all methods of cost-cutting are applied to increase profit margins. In the process, it is not just the customer, who ends up with inferior, quality goods or services but also genuine bidders, who eventually lose the race. The NITI Aayog must give higher weightage to quality, safety, implementation schedules and technical requirements. Quality checks and technical trials must be ensured at the initial stage itself. The price bids of top rankers could be opened and the one offering the lowest price could then be signed on.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/transparent-tenders-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/transparent-tenders.html
5,06-3-20,Success story of Jewar airport to echo in US,"The success story of the international airport being built in Jewar, Greater Noida, will now be heard in New York as the first phase has been included in the world’s 100 strategic global infrastructure projects for the year 2020.

Uttar Pradesh and Yugoslavia have been chosen in the field of aviation. It has been recognised in the CG LA Infrastructure list, a government spokesman said.

The success story of Jewar airport will be presented by the Uttar Pradesh government at the 13th Global Infrastructure Leadership Forum, to be held in New York City, US, on March 25-27. The Forum has sent an invitation to the Government of Uttar Pradesh. UP has to give its presentation in two sessions. The story of the success of the project of Jewar airport, which had been hanging fire for years, will be told. This is a major achievement for UP, the official said.

It is noteworthy that 1,334 hectares of land from six villages of Rohi, Parohi, Kishorepur, Dayanatpur, Ranhera and Banwari in Jewar Tehsil has been acquired in the first phase for the Jewar International Airport.

It will be the second largest international airport in Asia. Work is progressing rapidly at the site. Zurich Airport International AG is constructing the airport.

“The Yogi government is building Asia’s second largest airport, beating China. On its completion, UP’s economy will gain new momentum. While employment and trade will increase, other investors will also move towards Uttar Pradesh,” an official said.

Jewar Greenfield International Airport will boost industrial development in the state. The government is expected to earn more than Rs 1,10,000 crore from the airport being built with an investment of Rs 30,000 crore. More than one lakh people will get direct and indirect employment. This airport will bring an investment of about Rs one lakh crore for Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Yamuna Expressway.

It will be the fifth largest airport in the world. According to the proposal, flights will start operating in 2022-23. At present, Shanghai International Airport (China) is the second largest airport in Asia, spread over approximately 3,988 hectares. While the world’s largest airport is in Saudi Arabia, King Fahd International Airport of Dammam, built on 77,600 hectares of land.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/success-story-of-jewar----airport-to-echo-in-us.html
6,06-3-20,UP attracting global investors: Mahana,"Industrial Development Minister Satish Mahana said that Uttar Pradesh is continuously attracting global investors, as a result of which there is 18.6 per cent rise in investors’ interest in the state which, in turn, will provide employment to over 30,000 youths.

“UP is continuously attracting global investors. Investors interest in setting up projects in Uttar Pradesh under the India Investment Grid (IIG) has increased by 18.6 per cent while 51 per cent increase has taken place in the monitoring of projects in Uttar Pradesh (first quarter to second quarter, July-September 2019 and October-December 2019). This will provide employment to around 30,000 youths in Uttar Pradesh,” Mahana said in a statement issued on Thursday.

He said that IIG is an initiative of the Central government. It showcases investment opportunities available in 25 sectors in all the states and union territories of on one platform. This system also has the facility to find various investment opportunities. “Uttar Pradesh has a national share of over 13 per cent with the most investment-worthy projects at IIGs. These projects have been promoted by more than 32 government and private promoters,” he said.

Mahana said that these projects of Uttar Pradesh are running in 68 out of total 75 districts of the state. The top five countries that seek investment opportunities in Uttar Pradesh include the United States, Canada, Japan, Indonesia and China.

Mahana said that Uttar Pradesh, the country’s third-largest economy, contributes about 8 per cent to the national GDP. “The government is taking concrete steps to implement ‘Ease of Doing Business’ reforms for the facility of investors. As a result of the successful implementation of the reforms recommended by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DIPP), Government of India, Uttar Pradesh is now the ‘Achiever State’ in the ranking of states and had achieved 12th rank in the year 2018,” Mahana said.

The upgraded version of ‘Nivesh Mitra’, unveiled by the Prime Minister at the Uttar Pradesh Investors Summit-2018, is one of the largest digital single-window clearance platforms in the country. Starting from the integrated 69 services on this portal in the year 2018, as many as 125 services are now being provided online through ‘Nivesh Mitra’ and have recently crossed the benchmark of one lakh approvals. By next year, 159 services are planned to be provided online through Nivesh Mitra.

To further accelerate this pace of industrialisation in Uttar Pradesh, the state government is preparing to organise ‘UP Global Investors Summit-2020’. In order to achieve the goal of setting up a $1-trillion economy in Uttar Pradesh by organising the Global Investors Summit, the overall economic and social development of the state is expected through promoting environment which is friendly for investment and industries, and by propagating available natural and human resources and investment-oriented policies on the world stage, the minister said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-attracting-global----investors--mahana.html
7,06-3-20,The car as a metaphor,"The automobile has shaped human thought for over a century as the most potent symbol of mobility and one of our enduring signs of personal freedom. But is that image changing in modern times?

Sometimes, not having to write about ‘a’ car allows me the freedom to write on cars because I love the concept of cars, yet I do not know whether this is a love affair that can, or will, last forever in its current form.

In the pantheon of inventions that has changed the world, the internal combustion engine is up there alongside the internet and the printing press. It was an invention that destroyed the tyranny of distance more than any other. Sure, the steam engine did make travel faster but the limitation of steel wheels was evident from the very start and there was that one little thing that unless one owned their own railroad, private ownership of a train was quite out of the question. The car, therefore, was not just a symbol of mobility but of personal one too. A car was never beholden to timetables or the thing that you could go anywhere the road took you. It was and remains a sign of independence. For me, becoming independent of my parents was not the day I turned 18 or when I started college, but the day I put the money down on my first car, incidentally a Maruti Alto when I was 22.

Many people will share this sentiment of mine. While in India, we might even add the motorcycle and scooter to the conversation, the point remains that it is the day that you get your own internal combustion engine to move around, whether it is on two wheels or four, is the day you truly grow up. And yes, many of us might have driven our parents’ cars and bikes, but it is something else when you own your own vehicle, when you pay for the car downright or the monthly instalments. Therefore, the car is a metaphor for freedom, for mobility and if it is that way for men, it is an even more powerful metaphor for women because at a very essential level, a car or a bike for women I believe, is at a level freedom from the tyranny of the patriarchy. Of course, I really do not mean to speak for them, but I genuinely believe more women should drive and ride in India.

Yet, we live in an era when cars are increasingly being seen as a burden. To the environment, as cars not only use critical resources that cost resources to produce but use up petroleum products that, as we all know, pollute the environment. At the same time, cars are a drain on budget-strapped governments, across the world, who are spending huge amounts of resources to maintain roadways that are primarily used by cars particularly in urban areas. The money can and I believe should be deployed on strengthening public transport. Cars are after all fairly inefficient, or rather they are an inefficient allocation of resources, most cars are used by just one person, and on this front do not count the chauffeur if you use one.

Then there is parking. After years of poor urban planning, this is an increasing challenge in cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru to name a few in India alone and it is also an issue elsewhere. The next generations of potential car buyers across the world, albeit less so in India, are seriously debating the pros and cons of car ownership.

The automotive industry is addressing some of their own pitfalls, lower emission vehicles are a fact of life today, and from April 1 when India moves to BS6 fuel norms, this country will have some of the strictest emission norms for new vehicles in the country.

However, state governments across the country have to remove the perfidy of poorly-maintained and illegal motorised vehicles that pollute. One could even argue that poor traffic management across India leads to avoidable pollution. But at the same time, state governments and the Centre will have to do their utmost to improve public transportation, and on that front the large metro projects across the country and the ambitious Regional Railways project in the NCR should help remove millions of vehicles off the streets. City governments should also look at implementing congestion charges and Ola and Uber (and other services) should help as well. There needs to be allowance made for more ride-sharing and carpooling as well, which will allow for better utilisation of cars, just two people instead of one will make a huge difference if car owners are allowed to monetise their seats while commuting.

But the issue is not that. The issue is that the metaphors that cars have always signified are changing. From freedom and mobility, we now talk of cars as polluting and a waste of resources and that is not good for the industry in the long term. But, the industry should also realise that it is in their best interests to support some of the changes, lower emissions and even the development of public transport links. I do not believe that cars are bad, but they are certainly not what they used to be and if the industry is not careful, cars might end up going from being the hero to becoming a zero.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-car-as-a-metaphor-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-car-as-a-metaphor.html
8,06-3-20,How to harness nari shakti,"Chetna Sinha set up the Mann Deshi Foundation with the aim of economically and socially empowering women in Maharashtra's Mhaswad village. She has never looked back

Mhaswad village is a mere blip on India’s vast geographic radar but it shines brightly on the country’s development landscape. The lodestar in this parched village is a woman of indefatigable stamina and unshakable courage. Chetna Gala Sinha has dedicated her life to empowering some of the area’s most impoverished and dispossessed women by giving them the tools to run businesses of their own. Her work has transformed the lives of nearly half a million women and she hopes to help one million women by 2024. Mhaswad village, which has become a crucible for some of the most revolutionary social experiments, nestles in Satara district, on the placid banks of Manganga River, some 300 km south-east of Mumbai.

Rural areas typically face several developmental impediments: Small land holdings; low savings and capital formation; stagnant factor productivity; limited market access; low levels of human development; paucity of resources and a young population alienated from farming and other rural occupations. Reliant for the most part on subsistence agriculture, villagers are packing up in droves and heading to cities. They need solutions tailored to their needs and problems. Short-term palliatives like loan waivers and cash transfers cannot cure or address the pathology of poverty or fix the deep fault lines in the rural economy. Sinha’s work with marginalised communities is now a legend. Described variously as a social entrepreneur, a microfinance banker, an economist, a farmer and an activist, Sinha has set a path that continues to remain relevant and resonant. She has nurtured social entrepreneurship at the grassroots that is redefining the way the world thinks about rural distress. Sinha has been able to build women’s perspectives in the context of development, enabling them to claim space in the political, economic, societal and cultural systems. Women are reframing crucial questions on burning issues, about their experiences, problems, needs and are developing a different narrative.

Sinha grew up in Mumbai where she obtained a postgraduate degree in economics. She then moved to Bihar to work with landless labourers. She came in contact with the youth movement led by Jaiprakash Narayan and was inspired by his socialist philosophy. She met her husband Vijay Sinha, a farmer from Mhaswad, during a farmers’ movement in Maharashtra between 1984 and 1985. She moved from Mumbai to Mhaswad after marriage.

Transplanted to a totally alien culture, Sinha initially found it difficult to strike roots. She spent time helping her husband on the farm and organising the local community on different issues. The world of inequities that surrounded her kept her restless and she soon found her bearings. With the ebullient spirit that was honed in JPs movement, she set her sights on toppling the status quo in her husband’s county. She followed through to tackle inequities and eradicate dysfunction in the local society. “I found life completely different from Mumbai. It opened my eyes to the plight of people at the grassroots level and the challenge of working for their benefit came with the idealism I had grown up with,” recalls Sinha.

In 1996, Sinha founded the Mann Deshi Foundation with the aim of economically and socially empowering rural women. One of Sinha’s first actions was to set up a bank for village women. She believes access to finance is an important piece in the development ecosystem and has necessarily to be at the core of any economic strategy. “Financial services are like safe water and clean energy — they are essential to leading a better life”, says Sinha. Mann Deshi Mahila Sahakari Bank is India’s first bank that runs for and is managed by rural women. It began with 840 women members, each contributing a share capital of Rs 600. Today, it has nine branches, more than 28,000 members and a share capital of Rs 69 crore. It has enabled thousands of women to save, insure and to responsibly borrow —allowing them to build their assets and improve their well-being and financial prospects. The bank offers specially-designed savings accounts, pension services and insurance products as well as individualised loans. Financing is perhaps the biggest problem faced by small businesses in the developing world. People need credit to increase their financial prospects. “The greatest fracture facing India is women’s inequality”, reiterates Sinha. “The majority of women are doing business on roads in cities and villages, selling things in haats but they do not have access to funds. Regular banks aren’t typically an option; they have several formalities, fee and documentation that can be intimidating and require an arduous trek to the nearest town, which can compromise a day’s wages. Banks find this segment unviable because they feel the costs of underwriting and originating these small loans are substantial,” she says.

Mann Deshi serves as an umbrella platform for several community initiatives like cattle camps; mobile para-veterinary services; erection of check dams; running a farmer produce company; local radio stations and sports talent hunts. Some of the more modern innovations include a business school and the Mann Deshi Chamber of Commerce for Rural Women (MCCRW) in partnership with the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI)

Mann Deshi Business School for Rural Women (MDBSRW) is a unique nursery for unlettered women. It places “professional” expertise in the hands of the weakest of the weak and the poorest of the poor: Village women. Set up in 2006, MDBSRW offers a menu of 25 courses, largely developed in-house. These include classes in finance and marketing management and vocational skills such as screen-printing, chutney-making, bag-making, tailoring and catering among others. The courses are certified by the National Skill Development Corporation of India (NSDC). This ingenuity was recognised alongside Harvard Business School and Fuqua School of Business in a Financial Times’ ranking of the best B-schools.

A unique idea is the Business School on Wheels.The state-of-the-art bus travels with computers and micro ATMs. MDBSRW also offers a Deshi MBA, which is a year-long course where women attend workshops on finance, planning, inventory, marketing and accounting. The course syllabus was developed by Mumbai’s SP Jain Management Institute and acclaimed non-profit Accion. When the programme was set up in 2015 just 286 women participated. This year, 958 women graduated. A Deshi MBA student is also provided with a mentor. With chapters of the business school in 12 centres equipped with nine buses, MDBSRW has unleashed an entrepreneurial wave in villages across Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka.

Mann Desha has helped over 4,00,000 women set up businesses and access new markets. Traditionally confined to the home, these village women have now become productive, articulate and confident in their ability to think for themselves. Sinha argues that rural women should be acknowledged for who they really are — a new generation of dynamic entrepreneurs, job-creators and economy drivers, committed to bringing a change in their communities.

Women have also been trained as “barefoot professionals”. Four years ago, Mann Deshi started a unique initiative to train women in goat farming, vaccinations, first aid and artificial insemination. They are popularly known as “goat doctors.” Today the team has 19 para-veterinarians.

The biggest contribution to the local economy are the cattle camps. This year, the cattle camp was set up in January in collaboration with the Bajaj Foundation and two other organisations. It provides fodder, water and shelter needed to sustain cattle from surrounding villages when periodical and recurrent drought stares at them. Spread over 100 acres, it sheltered 7,000 cows and 20,000 goats belonging to more than 50 villages. Along with the cattle shed, smaller tents — made out of cloth, straw, leaves and plastic sheeting — are built for families accompanying the scrawny cattle. People work through the day, chopping sugarcane and preparing wet fodder for the cattle.

Sinha has been awarded the Nari Shakti Puraskar, India’s highest civilian award for women who work in the area of women’s empowerment, Schwab Foundation’s Social Entrepreneur of the Year Award (2013), Forbes Social Entrepreneurs of the Year Award (2017). She has served as a Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum in Davos (2018) and as a Co-Chair of Financial Inclusion at the W20 Summit (2018) in Argentina.

From Mumbai to Mhaswad, Sinha has come a long way. She succeeded because she looked at the familiar problems with fresh eyes. Sinha’s work has several lessons for policymakers, who may think of changing the direction of their discourses. India spends more on programmes for the poor than most developing countries but is not getting the expected dividends that significant public expenditure would seem to warrant. The Government can complement the efforts of crusaders like Sinha by identifying, adapting and successfully scaling up promising interventions instead of rolling out more and more reforms.

9,06-3-20,Waqf board to announce details of trust after Holi,"Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) has deferred its all-important meeting to announce the trust for the construction and maintenance of the mosque in the five-acre land allotted by the Supreme Court in its Ayodhya verdict.

The trust will also build a charitable hospital, a public library and is likely to be named ‘Indo-Islamic Cultural Centre’.

UPSCWB chairperson Zufar Farooqui told reporters here on Thursday that the meeting for approving the trust has been deferred and now it will be held later this month.

However, he said that in today’s (Thursday) meeting, the board addressed several regular cases and heard their counsels. “It was just a normal monthly meeting and the issue of setting up of the trust was not discussed,” he added.

Farooqui also said that the trust would be formed on consensus and there is no such dispute within the board members about it.

Meanwhile, sources revealed the trust would comprise 10 members, most of from Sunni Waqf Board. While Zufar Farooqui is expected to be the chairman of the new trust, two Muslim scholars and one Sunni Waqf Board member with legal background are also expected to join in.

It is also said that the present term of the board members would expire on March 31 next and there is a speculation that the trust could be announced next month after the new board members are appointed.

Sources also said Imran Mabood Khan and Abdul Razzaq, members of the board who have opposed Farooqui’s decision, might not be included in the trust. The opposing members will be given the responsibility of looking after the construction and maintenance on the five-acre alternate land that was allotted to the board by the Supreme Court.

The five-acre plot for the mosque in Ayodhya was allotted by the Uttar Pradesh government nearly 25 kilometers away from the Ram Temple Complex at Dhannipur village in the Sohawal Tehsil of Ayodhya. Litigants in the Babri case have said the land chosen for the mosque was too far from the town and needs to be reconsidered.

“The site for the mosque is too far from Ayodhya. It will be difficult for people to go that far to offer ‘namaz’. The decision should be reconsidered and land must be allotted nearby,” litigant Haji Mahboob said.

Iqbal Ansari, the son of Hashim Ansari and one of the main litigants in the Ayodhya case, said he hoped the allocated area was close to the disputed site. “The allocated land is quite far from Ayodhya. It should be in the city making it convenient for the people. It is now up to the Sunni Waqf Board to accept the land or not,” he added.

In a landmark verdict in November, the Supreme Court granted the ownership of the site claimed by both Hindus and Muslims entirely to Ram Lalla. It then ordered the government to set up a trust to oversee the construction of the temple, and allot five acres of land at a “prominent place” in Ayodhya for a mosque.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/waqf-board-to-announce--details-of-trust-after-holi.html

14,06-3-20,Himachal’s growth rate likely to decline,"In the backdrop of global slowdown, Himachal Pradesh too seemed to be affected as its growth rate is expected to decline to 5.6 percent in 2019-20 however, the per capita income in the State has increased to Rs 1,95,255.

Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur informed about this while laying the Economic Survey for 2019-20 in the Assembly on Thursday. The economic survey had pegged the growth rate at 5.6 percent which was the lowest in the last four years as the growth rate in 2018-19 was 7.1 percent, 6.8 percent in 2017-18 and 7 percent in 2016-17.

The State's per capita income at current prices as per the first revised estimates witnessed an increase of 11 per cent in 2018-19 from Rs 165,025 in 2017-18. The national per capita income is pegged at Rs 1,26,521 in 2018-19.

However, the fruit production declined to 4.95 lakh tonne in 2018-19 against 5.65 lakh tonne in 2017-18, showing a fall of 12.4 per cent in 2018-19. The fruit production in 2019-20 (up to December 2019) is almost double at 7.07 lakh tonne.

The State's economy has shown a shift from agriculture sector to industries and services as the percentage contribution of agriculture in total state domestic product has declined from 57.9 per cent in 1950-51 to just 8.4 per cent in 2018-19.

16,06-3-20,Thalassemia-hit kid’s father abused trying to meet CM,"I tried to meet the CM when he visited to Sundargarh, but one of the BJD leaders misbehaved with me. When I told them that I don’t want money and I only need treatment for my son, he again abused me,” was the voice of the father of a kid suffering from Thalassemia, who was abused by a BJD leader while trying to meet the CM on his visit to Sundargarh on March 3 to seek some assistance for the treatment of his ailing son.

Sources said Kumuda Kishore Mahato of Sundargarh came to know that his child Samarjit was suffering from Thalassemia after eight months of his birth. Since then he had visited several hospitals and consulted many doctors. He was advised by doctors that his son needed blood infusion every month. Even he had consulted doctors in Vellore where he was advised bone marrow transplantation which cost Rs 40 lakh.

Unable to arrange such a huge amount, he wanted to meet the CM during the latter’s meeting in Sundargarh on Tuesday. However, he had to face humiliation and returned empty handed. After being humiliated Mahato said, “Everyone told me as to who will give Rs 40 lakh for treatment. So, I tried to meet the CM to request him for assistance for his son’s treatment.”

After the humiliation to Mahato the slogan of “Mo Sarkar” and big claims of the State government have fallen flat, alleged the opposition parties here. They said for vote bank politics, the BJD Government was luring the poor and innocent people with many lucrative schemes and projects but in ground level all were hollow.

Speaking on the matter, Sundergarh sub-collector, Abhimanyu Behera said, “Instead of going to the venue of the CM’s programme, he should have approached the Chief Minister’s Grievance Cell for help.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/thalassemia-hit-kid---s-father-abused-trying-to-meet-cm.html

The theme of the Police Expo is ‘new age solutions for effective & efficient policing’. The NSA was invited as the chief guest of the event. He went round the Expo and saw the latest technologies and equipments displayed there.

Doval inaugurated the conference and Expo by lighting the traditional lamp and released Haryana Police Journal and compendium of equipments of BPR & D .

Addressing the young Superintendents of Police, Doval shared his insights on the importance of technology in terms of police functioning and maintaining law and order. He said that newer innovations and technology induction in policing can bring change in the overall implementation and enforcing of laws in this country. Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used for security purposes in different districts. There is plethora of data available with the various police departments that can be used as a great resource for planning for internal security. It can be used to study the behaviour of criminals and identify them even in a large gathering like Kumbh mela.

Talking about the role of police personnel, he said that the legislature makes the law and the police enforces it, if you fail in its implementation democracy fails. He said you fail because your constants are too many and variables are few.

Talking about providing technological induction into lives of policemen working at the ground level, he said that this will empower and enable the last man in police force. He asked the young officers to train the policemen in advance technologies and said that integration of technology is more important than its knowledge.

Recalling Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s words, he said that recently the PM in one of his speeches said that if one police station can do one good deed that reaches the masses, the credibility of the police force is emboldened. He said that as young officers they should first identify and define the problem and then approach the agencies like BPR&D , DRDO etc to provide solutions. If no solution is available with them, than they should find solutions themselves. The technology can come and in support for solving a problem. He said we have new threats from drones, which need to be addressed by use and integration of technology.

Manoj Yadava, Director General of Police, Haryana in his address talked extensively about the ‘national security prowess’ of the NSA, He said, “ Mr Ajit Doval is the last word and authority on the national security matters. He is not only a theorist on national security and but also a practitioner. Technology in policing can be a great asset when police personnel use it in an effective manner.”

Sangita Reddy, President, FICCI, in her address highlighted the importance of security in holistic economic growth.

During the first meeting of re-constituted Chandigarh Heritage Items Protection Cell under the chairmanship of UT Advisor Manoj Parida here, it was decided that the Administration will invite internationally renowned auction houses for holding the auction of heritage items.

The Protection Cell approved an action plan for identification, restoration and use of heritage items in Chandigarh. Deepika Gandhi, Director, Le Corbusier Centre, who had prepared the action-plan, gave a presentation elaborating it during the meeting.

Following Administration’s nod to the action plan on Thursday, an expert committee would now be constituted for conducting physical verification of heritage items, certification of genuine heritage items, restoration and preservation of such items and to conduct its auction.

All these works would be done in collaboration with France based Fondation Le Corbusier. A five-member team from the Fondation is scheduled to visit Chandigarh next month to assist the Administration in physical verification of heritage items, its certification and restoration.

Only last month, a French delegation comprising Brigitte Bouvier, Director, France based Fondation Le Corbusier had visited the city to hold discussion with UT Administration on issues related to preservation and restoration of heritage buildings and items.

According to an inventory prepared by the UT Administration in the year 2012, Chandigarh has ‘12793’ heritage items designed by city’s creator Franco-Swiss architect Le Corbusier or his team associated with the founding and planning of the city in 1950s and 60s. There are 190 different categories of the heritage items including drawings, murals, models, tapestries, chairs, tables, among others.

In the past one decade, renowned foreign auction houses have shoveled in millions through the auction of Chandigarh’s heritage items including tables, teak stools, arm chairs, lounge chairs, book cases, manholes, coffee tables, executive desks and others.

“As the value of Chandigarh’s heritage items is very high in international market, the Chandigarh Heritage Items Protection Cell has decided to hold auction of such items to generate revenue,” said a member of Chandigarh Heritage Items Protection Cell requesting anonymity.

The member said that an expert committee would be constituted to carry out physical verification of heritage items. Through this, genuine heritage items would be identified and their certification would be done, the member said. A team from France based Fondation Le Corbusier is scheduled to visit the city in April to help the Administration in the entire process. They will train officials here for carrying out preservation and restoration works, the member added.

As only a three-member Chandigarh Heritage Inventory Committee, constituted by UT Administration was involved in the finalization of heritage inventory in the year 2011 and 2012, doubts looms over the “genuineness” of identified heritage items belonging to the city. During the meeting, concerns were also raised over the theft of heritage manhole covers in the city. There are around 2224 cast iron manhole covers bearing an impression of Chandigarh map, which were designed by architect Le Corbusier in 1950s.

It was decided to include a member from Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh in the Heritage Items Protection Cell to chalk out a plan for the preservation of heritage manhole covers.

Notably, Paris based auction house Artcurial had auctioned a city’s manhole cover for 17,851 Euros (Rs 10.87 lakh) in 2010 while in 2007, another manhole cover bearing the master plan of Chandigarh designed by Corbusier had fetched a whopping USD 21,000 (Rs 830,000) at a Christie’s auction in New York.

ADMN TO APPROACH EMBASSIES ABROAD ON FAKE HERITAGE ITEMS

With renowned foreign auction houses continue to put under hammer the heritage furniture belonging to the city, the Administration has decided to write a letter to Embassies of various countries to draw their attention towards the “fake” heritage furniture and other items that is being sold as Chandigarh’s heritage items.

“The Administration has decided to write to the Embassies of the countries where the heritage items are being auctioned. There are doubts that fake heritage furniture is being sold by foreign based auction houses and the same would be informed to the Embassies,” said the member of Heritage Items Protection Cell.

During the meeting, Chandigarh based advocate Ajay Jagga, who is the member of the Protection Cell raised the issue of auction of city’s heritage furniture held at Chantilly in France in March.

Paris based auction house had held the auction of lot of furniture designed by Pierre Jeanneret, a close associate of city’s architect Le Corbusier. A sofa and two sofa chairs fetched a whopping prize of Rs 53.93 lakh followed by two arm chairs which were sold for Rs 28.60 lakh at the auction.

Meanwhile, UT Adviser Manoj Parida said that awareness would be created at every possible level, domestically or internationally, regarding illegal auction of heritage items of Chandigarh across the globe. For this, use of social media such as Facebook, Twitter etc could also be made.

He also directed the officials to identify three to four places of the city wherein the heritage items could be placed.

Notably, the Administration has attracted severe criticism over regular auction of city’s heritage furniture items abroad. While the UT Administration had in the past taken up the matter with British Embassy and French Embassy to put an end to the auction of the drawings, sketches and furniture designed by Le Corbusier and his associate Pierre Jeanneret, many auction houses continue to put under the hammer lots of furniture designed by city’s creators.

The furniture and other items categorized as heritage was designed in the late 50s for the government offices here but the furniture was replaced in the late 80s and 90s. Most of the UT Departments, unaware of the international worth of this furniture, had auctioned these as a part of junk.

But after several years, it came as a big surprise to the UT Administration when the city’s furniture, sold as a junk for mere rupees in government auctions, went on sale for thousands of dollars by an auction house abroad in 2007.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ut-to-auction-heritage-items-of-chandigarh.html

53,06-3-20,"Ex-Haryana Min, daughter launch political front","Former Haryana Minister Nirmal Singh and his daughter Chitra Sarwara on Wednesday floated a political front, vowing to protect interests of the northern part of the State.

Nirmal Singh, who had served as a Minister in the Bhajan Lal-led Congress Government in the State, had quit the party after his daughter Chitra, who earlier held the post of the All-India Mahila Congress general secretary, was denied ticket from Ambala Cantonment in the assembly elections held last year.

The former minister and his daughter then contested as independent candidates from Ambala City and Ambala Cantt, respectively, but both lost the elections despite getting a sizeable number of votes.

The Haryana Democratic Front, which will be headed by Singh, who has influence in the state's northern region, has appealed to all ''like-minded'' forces to come together to strengthen the new outfit. ""The front will protect the interests of north Haryana. We will be holding a big conference of our workers on March 15 at Ambala,"" said Singh, who has been a four-time MLA.

""The way people supported us in the October 2019 assembly polls, it shows that they want us to be actively involved in politics to serve their cause and raise their voice,"" said Sarwara. She said the front believes in ""clean politics"" and will encourage people with clean image to join them.

Hitting out at the BJP-JJP coalition in Haryana, Singh said they raised hopes of people with tall promises but failed to deliver on the ground.

54,06-3-20,BJP leaders seek Odisha PMAY ‘scam’ probe,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MPs and MLAs from Odisha met Union Rural Development and Panchayati Raj Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in New Delhi on Thursday and sought a probe into the alleged irregularities in implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) in the State.

They alleged gross discrepancies in the assessment of eligibility of beneficiaries, blatant favouritism and nepotism in allotment of houses and utilisation of funds for houses under the PMAY as well as in the housing assistance granted by the Government of India for rehabilitation of people affected by last year’s Cyclone Fani.

“It is shocking to be told about the glaring inconsistencies being reported against the Government of Odisha in the implementation of PMAY scheme, and specifically the foul-play in distribution of housing funds. Media reports across the State have highlighted that that no less than 10 lakh or 85% out of the 12.85 lakh PMAY beneficiaries in Odisha are ineligible for the scheme, meaning that a vast majority of the funds have been misutilised for personal gains while depriving the true beneficiaries of the scheme. A thorough investigation is needed to ascertain the extent of deviation from the Central guidelines in the preparation list of beneficiaries by the Government of Odisha,” said a memorandum submitted by the MPs and MLAs to the Union Minister.

They sought Tomar’s personal intervention in launching a thorough investigation into the allegations by an agency of the Government of India.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-leaders-seek-odisha-pmay----scam----probe.html

77,06-3-20,"Bijubabu's life a saga of adventures, sacrifices","Biju Patnaik was a great Indian and a prodigious Odia too. He dedicated his life to build a great egalitarian and democratic India. His life was a saga of sacrifice and adventure. His ability to create confidence among the people of Odisha and inspire them was phenomenal.

He had a remarkable capacity to transmit his cheerful strength to others. For that Julian Huxley, the great zoologist of international fame and the brother of eminent world philosopher Aldus Huxley speaking about Bijubabu rightly said, “A memorable Indian whose adventures will surly fill a book.""

As per the remark of an eminent economist the long life can be read as something of a history of India back to the time when the country was run by the British. And he gave Indian politics a rare fresh of colour. When Dr Ram Manohar Lohia was seriously ill and admitted in Wellington hospital, New Delhi almost in a stage of coma. It was almost the daily routine of Bijubabu to come and see Lohia in the hospital which proves his loyalty and humanity. The affectionate feelings of Patnaik towords Dr Lohia brings to memory the days of the Quit India Movement of 1942 lunched by Mahatma Gandhi. Bijubabu along with Dr Lohia, Jaya Prakash Narayan, Aruna Asaf Ali and Achut Patwardhan kept the flag of 1942 movement flying after Gandhiji’s arrest. Bijubabu was a young pilot then. He was courageous enough to make the supreme sacrifice by actively responding to the clarion call of ‘Do or Die’ of Mahatma Gandhi. He was arrested and put behind the bars along with other leaders.

Bijubabu was born in Cuttack on March 5, 1916 in the lap of Ashalata Devi and Laxminarayan Pattnaik. Although his father Laxminarayan was in judicial service but was a great nationalist and also a prominent leader of the Oriya movement. Bijubabu inherited the qualities of fearlessness, strongness and love of Odisha right from his parents. He had two brothers and one sister. He had his early education in Mission Primary School and Christ Collegiate School at Cuttack. In 1927 he admitted in the famous Revenshaw Collegiate School where Netaji once was a student. He passed matriculation with first division and got admitted in science class of the famous Revenshaw College Cuttack. In his student career, he was an accomplished sportsman and led the university teams champion in football, cricket, hockey and athletics for three consecutive years. He discontinued studies for a B.sc degree to undergo training as a pilot at the Aeronautic Training Institute of India and Delhi Flying Club. He married Gyan in 1939.

He showed his penchant for the extraordinary at a very young age. Like his role model Napoleon, he seemed to have deleted the word ‘impossible' from his dictionary. When Japan entered the war in 1941, Bijubabu evacuated British families from the advancing invaders. He pioneered risky operations across the Himalayas to help the Chinese revolutionaries in Chiang Kai Shek’s China. He once flew all the way to Stalingrad on yet another mission. The British Government particularly appreciated his efforts to evacuate British families from Rangoon when the Japanese invaded Myanmar during World War-II.

In 1971, Bijubabu formed a State party named ‘Utkal Congress’. He then did not look back and never joined the Congress till the end of his life. After the victory in Bangladesh war in 1971, Indira Gandhi was very ruthless in dealing with those in opposition parties. Biju Pattnaik and Rabi Ray agreed for the formation of a national alternative of all opposition parties at the Centre to save the country from the impending authoritarian rule of Gandhi. Bijubabu was such a veteran leader who lost no time in getting the active cooperation of two former Chief Minister Hare Krushna Mahatab and RN Singdeo. The net result of the efforts was formation of Pragati Dal consisting of ‘ Swatantra Party(Singdeo), Utkal Congress (Pattnaik) and the Sanjukta Socialist Party (Ray) formed in Odisha. The lunching of Pragati Dal was bound to catch the imagination of the people in the State.

Bijupatnaik is considered as a pioneer of the industrial growth of Odisha and established a string of industries in misson. He set up the Kalinga Tubes, the first modern textile mills at Choudwar, the first refrigerator factory at Jobra and a low shaft furnance at Barbil. He started his own airline, the Kaling Airways and in 1947 carried soldiers to Kashmir, when he was threatened from across the newly created border sky.

At great risk, he landed the first platoon of troops in Srinagar. In 1951 he established the Kaling Prize for the popularization of science and entrusted the responsibility to the UNESCO. The MIG factory at Sunabeda, Balimela Dam, Public Corporations, Panchayat Industries, the Express High way and a lot many are his contributions. His ambitious projects, which he named as “ Decade of Destiny” was meant to elevate the State to a new height.

The period of Biju between 1961-67 is aptly described as the golden era in the history of education of the State. At his initiative the Regional College of Education was set up at Bhubaneswar .The Regional Engineering College at Rourkela was established in 1961. The Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology was set up during the Chief Ministership of Biren Mitra when Biju was the Chairman of the State Planning Board. Universities were established in Brahmapur and Sambalpur.

A long illustrious career came to an end on April 17, 1997 when Biju Patnaik passed away at Delhi. In his death, Odisha lost a greatest figure. At a stretch, he was flamboyant, dynamic, reckless, daredevil and dam efficient. Another Biju Patnaik may never take birth in the soil of Odisha. But Bijubabu left a proud legacy like Naveen Patnaik, our beloved Chief Minister.

79,06-3-20,DDA issue rocks U’khand Assembly on Day 3,"The issue of district development authority (DDA) led to pandemonium in the house on the third day of budget session of Uttarakhand assembly on Thursday as both Congress and BJP members came face to face with one another. The deadlock was such that the house had to be adjourned twice.

As soon as the proceedings of the day started, the opposition Congress members demanded that discussions under rule 310 should be held on DDA as people are facing problems due to them. When the deputy speaker Raghunath Singh Chauhan who was presiding over the house asked the Congress members to let the house function, the agitated Congress members marched to the well of the house and demanded discussion on the issue.

The speaker at this juncture refused discussion under rule 310 and but allowed the discussion under rule 58. The Congress members appeared satisfied by the ruling and returned back to their places but the BJP members objected to the decision. The parliamentary affairs minister, Madan Kaushik said that the issue cannot be taken up for discussion as a committee of the house which had members from both BJP and Congress had submitted its report to the speaker. “The house can now discuss the recommendations of the committee and cannot take up the issue for fresh discussion,’’ he said. Other BJP members too joined the minister in opposing the ruling of the chair.

The commotion was such that the speaker had to adjourn the house twice which resulted in loss of question hour. Later the issue was taken up for discussion. The Leader of Opposition (LoP), Indira Hridayesh said the DDAs have become the centres of corruption and common people are facing problems due to them.

80,06-3-20,Will prepare a blueprint for Gairsain’s development: CM,"The Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has said that the basic concept behind creation of the separate State of Uttarakhand was to ensure the development of remote areas and his declaration of Gairsain as summer capital of Uttarakhand is in sync with this concept.

Talking to The Pioneer, the CM said that the Government would seek the opinion of the experts of various fields on development of Gairsain and prepare a blue print. “We will first select the works and then prepare a time bound plan for their completion.

Our objective is to take development to the last person. Our decision on Gairsain would change the mindset of the policy makers,’’ he said. On the question of Congress party's claim that it would make Gairsain, permanent capital of Uttarakhand, the CM said that Congress is in opposition and it is natural for it to oppose Government but the fact is that Congress ruled the State for 10 years and had intelligent CMs like Narayan Dutt Tiwari, Harish Rawat and Vijay Bahuguna but no one took any stand on Gairsain. The CM said that in its vision document released ahead of the assembly elections of 2017, the BJP had promised that Gairsain would be made summer capital of Uttarakhand.

“We have fulfilled 75 per cent of the commitments made in the vision document and it is for the first time that any Government in the state has fulfilled such a high percentage of promises made,’’ he said. On the question of cabinet expansion which is overdue, Rawat said that it would be after March 18.

The BJP government is completing three years in office on March 18. On the contentious issue of reservation in promotions, the CM said that government would soon take a decision on it.

This decision would be impartial, he added. The CM claimed that all work of the upcoming Kumbh Mela 2021 would be completed in time. “All works barring one would be completed in December this year. We have increased the area of Kumbh from 600 hectares to 1500 hectares. The budget for Kumbh Mela would be around Rs 2000 crore,’’ he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/will-prepare-a-blueprint-for-gairsain---s-development--cm.html

On the day, a big crowd gathered outside the assembly building and expressed happiness on the decision.

An atmosphere of Holi prevailed as ecstatic people smeared Gulal on the faces of the MLAs and other leaders. The women staged an impromptu folk dance (Jhumalo) in front of the imposing building of assembly. The chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and other ministers joined the celebrations.

The declaration of summer capital status to Gairsain has infused hope of development among the local population. Arvind Singh Rawat, a resident of Diwalikhal near Bharadisain said that the government should focus on broadening of roads.

Another resident, Dharmendra Panwar said that hospitals and schools should be set up. “There is only one doctor posted at PHC of Junglechatti and we have to take our patients to either Karnprayag or Ramnagar,’’ he said. Grocery shop owner Rakesh Panwar said that the government should first carve out Gairsain district for expediting developmental activity in the area. The demand of Gairsain district is very strong in the area and most the people inquired by this correspondent supported the demand so that a positive step in the direction of capital declaration is taken.

An emotional Keshar Singh, a 73 year old farmer of Kheti village said, “The CM has taken a very bold decision. We hope that the area would now witness a spurt in development activities. The youth of the village would get employment locally,’’ he said. The villagers of Parwari where the assembly building of Bharadisain is located marched to the assembly in a group and thanked BJP leaders. Dhiraj Singh of the village said that the government should construct a stretch of road measuring only 3 km to Bharadisain.

Surendra Singh of Chandpur Gadi located between Adibadri and Gairsain said that the place deserved to be the permanent capital of the state as it is centrally located.

History is associated with this place, Chandpur Garhi was the place where the first ruler of Garhwal set up his capital, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/atmosphere-of-festivity-in-and-around-gairsain.html

Vikanshu and Aish Mohammad were given a new life through this procedure. Vikanshu is a 21 year old resident of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh. He was undergoing regular dialysis for nearly a year now. On the other hand, Aish Mohammad, a 34 year resident of Muradpur Hapur in Uttar Pradesh had also been undergoing regular dialysis for years due to the failure of both her kidneys. Family members of Vikanshu and Aish Mohammad say that doctors at many hospitals in big cities refused to go for transplant.

Checks revealed that Vikanshu was infected with hepatitis for which he was treated. Dr Chandel said that the blood group of Vikanshu and Aish Mohammed did not match with their respective family members. Due to this, they were advised to go for kidney swap transplant.

The Health Minister said this at Assembly portico talking to media persons.

Gupta said, “The Government with an aim to improve the medical facilities at RIMS is contemplating on a proposal under which all private medical stores, nursing homes and private medical hospitals will be closed down within 2 km periphery of RIMS so that the doctors at RIMS do not indulge in private practices.” Gupta however, said that this is just a proposal and not any directive as the Government is thinking over it.

The State government is much strict on private practice of RIMS doctors and in this connection two months back the health department had constituted a special vigilance team to keep track of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Ranchi doctors indulging in private practices.

As private practice by government doctors is banned in the state, the move will be targeted to check any malpractice by medical practitioners in the state. Jharkhand government has banned private practices for its practising government doctors as the government provides them with non-practising allowance (NPA).

The NPA is a special kind of allowance paid to the medical professionals at the posts of Medical and Veterinary Services.

Sources said that though the Government is planning to bring directive it will not be an easy task to shut down all medical shops, nursing colleges and private hospitals within the periphery of 2 km as entire stretch from RIMS to Karamtoli, Morhabadi, Harihar Singh Road and major portions of Bariatu area will be covered.

Sources said that within the periphery of 2 km of RIMS there are several major hospitals and private clinics. Manoj Sinha who runs a medical store near RIMS said, “The government plan to close down medical stores within 2 km periphery will adversely affect patients as people reaches us only when there is non-availability of medicines at hospital.” The health minister also said that in the meeting directives were also issued to health department officials to prepare answers to questions that will be raised at Assembly proceedings.

Gupta said, “In Assembly lawmaker raises questions about various schemes and projects of health department. Our aim is that government gives satisfactory answers to all such questions in the larger interest of people.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/plan-to-close-medical-stores--nursing-homes-near-rims--gupta.html
88,06-3-20,BJP protests over closure of MMKAY,"State BJP Spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo has alleged that it appears that the State government is obliged towards the moneylenders of the State. It is therefore, he said, the government has closed the Mukhyamantri Krishi Ashirwad Yojna (MMKAY).

Pratul said that Raghubar Das government had decided to give incentives for farming from Rs 5000 to Rs 25000 to get the farmers out of the clutches of the Mahajans (moneylenders) and its installments were also deposited in the farmers' account. The rationale behind this was that the farmers would not have to take up farming by taking loans.

“But, Hemant government has stopped this plan and has shown that he wants to send the farmers back to the clutches of the Mahajans. His party president Shibu Soren started the movement against the Mahajans and the JMM will give them the support today. The BJP will oppose the closure of this scheme from Assembly to the roads, because it will be in the interest of the indigenous tribal farmers of the state, who were directly connected with the scheme.”

Pratul said that the announcement of farm loan waiver is also a hoax. “The coalition parties had in their manifesto talked about the loan waiver of the farmers. There was no monetary limit imposed in it. But in the budget, the government announced a loan waiver of up to Rs 50,000 only. The government also did not say what the nature of the loan waiver scheme will be for the farmers who have taken loans from rural banks, cooperative banks and private banks. In Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, there were problems in these places and only 34 per cent of the farmers got the benefit of the loan waiver scheme, even where the governments had talked about giving benefits to 100 per cent farmers,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-protests-over-closure-of-mmkay.html
89,06-3-20,Activists protest to stop NPR in State,"Hundreds of people, from across Jharkhand, gathered at Raj Bhawan on Thursday to demanding from the Hemant Soren Government to reject National Population Register (NPR) and stop all NPR-related activities.

The protest ended with a resolve to continue the struggle against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register for Citizenship (NRC) and NPR and to intensify the pressure on the Hemant Soren Government to stop NRC.

Many people’s organisations participated in this ‘dharna’, convened by Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha (JJM). Across section of communities – Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Dalits, Adivasis and others – were all well represented. Participants also included women from Kadru, Ranchi’s own ‘Shaheen Bagh’, where hundreds of women have united in a continuous sit-in against CAA, NRC and NPR for several weeks.

The ‘dharna’ epitomized a rapidly growing concern among all communities in Jharkhand about the NPR-NRC process, which is due to start on April 1 along with the household listing of the 2021 census. Most people in Jharkhand don’t have the documents that are likely to be required from them if they are asked to prove their citizenship.

Addressing the gathering of protestors’ ex-IAS officer, Kannan Gopinathan, who resigned from the services, last year over alleged growing attacks on the democracy, said, “This is not a Hindu-Musalman issue at all; this act is anti-poor, anti-woman, anti-Adivasi who cannot produce the documents. The biggest danger of NPR is that one Babu at a block can tag anyone as a doubtful citizen. We need to ask questions about unemployment, which is highest in last few decades, 3.25 crore employment has gone in last 5 years, in private sector.”

Speaking on the occasion MLA Bagodar, Vinod Singh said, “It is a very positive step that the movement against NRC in Jharkhand is now being led and energised not only by Muslims but also by large numbers of women and men from all communities. This is not only a Muslim movement. This is a movement of Dalits, Adivasis, Villagers, Poor and others. There are many non-Muslims who have come out to make this message clear.”

Noted social worker Dayamani Barla said that RSS wants to take away the lands and evict the Jharkhandis from their own lands. “We will not let them succeed. This is not a fight of religions it is a fight to save our country and constitution, to save our hard-earned rights,” she added.

Other speakers included Kumar Chand Mardi, Prafull Linda, Jean Dreze, Dharamdas Valmiki, Ibrar Ahmad, Aloka Kujur, Vasavi Kiro, PC Murmu, Naren Kumar Bhuiyan, Prem Sahi Munda, among many others from all walks of life.

Their spirited speeches were interspersed with lively songs, slogans and poems. The creativity, solidarity and peacefulness that have marked most anti-NRC protests so far across the country were on full display.

The statements by the various speakers brought out the “communal, anti-poor, and exclusionary nature of the CAA-NPR-NRC process” especially in the context of Jharkhand with its large Adivasi population.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/activists-protest-to-stop-npr-in-state.html

After Babulal Marandi joins BJP, the party’s strength will increase to 26. If the two MLAs of AJSU are included, the number of pro-BJP MLAs increases to 28. In this way JMM-BJP can send their candidates to Rajya Sabha.

However, after meeting with the State Congress In-Charge, Singh, the CM said that it is sure that the UPA will win both the seats. RPN Singh said that in a conversation with Hemant Soren, it was decided that Shibu Soren will be the candidate for one of the two Rajya Sabha seats in Jharkhand. At the same time, the name of the candidate for the second seat is being considered by the Congress. There was speculation that Singh and Hemant Soren would jointly announce the name of second candidate but it did not happen.

The tenure of two Rajya Sabha members from the State will end on April 9 this year. The election process will start from March 6. Polling will held on March 26 on ballot paper.

It will also be wise to use herbal colours made from flowers and leaves.

To prevent any damage to the eyes from powder colours, Gupta has stressed upon the use of sun glasses. People should also stay away from playing with water balloons. To prevent any stains on the teeth, dental caps can be used.

The Minister has also stated that if one is prone to skin allergies of any kind, it would be better to consult a skin specialist before playing with colours. If anyone is suffering from asthma or any other respiratory disorder, it is advisable to play only with dry colours like gulal.

“The colours used for Holi celebrations are full of chemicals and can cause skin erosions which can further lead to allergic disorders. Herbal colours are certainly better than chemical based colours should be used for playing. In the present scenario, when there is anticipated risk of Cornonavirus, intimate relations and application of colours should be avoided,” said former Professor and Head of Skin Department Dr AS Prasad.

In order to enjoy the festival, use of any sort of dirty materials like mud or water from tanks, sewage should not be used at any cost.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/gupta-urges-people-to-stay-safe-in-holi.html

Singh said, “We have no Pro VC since March 2019. I act as Pro VC too. I am looking after UG examinations along with my PG examinations.”

About posts of deputy registrar and assistant registrars lying vacant the VC said, “Three posts are vacant one of deputy registrar and two of assistant registrars. These posts are to be filled by JPSC only. The university has sent its requisitions for these posts to JPSC. It is JPSC to take the final call.”

Sources said no one has any idea as to when 22 posts of professors, 44 posts of associate professors and 66 posts of assistant professors here will be filled up by JPSC.

Singh said, “Frankly speaking this NPU has no faculty of its own. We run with teachers of the colleges only.”

He said, “Our CCDC A K Pandey is going to have his second term as CCDC over in a few weeks from now and there is no provision for granting any third term to anyone having completed 2 terms as CCDC earlier. Tell me from where we will bring CCDC.”

107,06-3-20,150 CCTV cameras to keep eye on animal enclosures in zoo,"Birsa Zoological Park in Ranchi will get at least 150 CCTV cameras installed around the animal enclosures and set up a special control room to monitor the happenings across the zoo in a bid to avert mishaps similar to the one that occurred on Wednesday, zoo authorities said on Thursday.

A 28-year-old man jumped into the enclosure of a tigress in the zoo on Wednesday and was mauled to death by the big cat.

“We have already given the contract of installing CCTV cameras to a Nagpur-based company. A special control room will also be set up to monitor all the animal enclosures and spot any suspicious behavior by the visitors,” said Director of Birsa Zoological Park, Venkatesh Warlu. “Our staff is on high alert since the incident,” he added.

The deceased crossed a seven feet tall fence, jumped in a 15 feet deep moat and then climbed up the moat to reach the enclosure of an eight-year-old tigress named Anushka. The tigress attacked the man in a snap and killed him with two lethal bites on the neck before zoo authorities could come to his rescue. “He was attacked by the tigress as soon as he entered its enclosure. Our staff did not have enough time to respond,” said Warlu.

Warlu added that Wednesday’s mishap was a stray incident and such incidents do not occur on a regular basis. “The deceased man’s relatives confirmed that he was mentally unstable. Maybe he wanted to commit suicide. Our men even rushed to rescue him but the tigress had attacked him by then,” the zoo Director said.

The deceased, identified as Wasim Ansari alias Bablu, a resident of Booty in Ranchi, worked at a local garage and was under stress after getting estranged from his newly-wedded wife, police said. The zoo was closed for visitors on Wednesday after the incident caused panic among the staff at the zoological park. However, the Birsa Zoological Park opened its doors for visitors on Thursday, officials said.

The Birsa Zoological Park came into existence in 1994 and has been one of the major attractions for residents of urban and suburban Ranchi. The incident that occurred on Wednesday was the first case of its kind reported from the zoo in Ranchi, zoo authorities said.

In a similar incident in Delhi Zoo in 2014, a 20-year-old man was mauled to death by a white tiger in its enclosure. The victim accidentally had fallen into the enclosure while trying to capture the big cat on his camera. Similar incidents have also been reported from the Tata Zoological Park in Jamshedpur in the past.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/150-cctv-cameras-to-keep-eye-on-animal-enclosures-in-zoo.html

Sambhav program has contributed to the Jharkhand State Plan of Action to End Child Marriage launched by the State Government.

And further is also contributing & shaping the implementation of the Tejaswini programme run by the Government of Jharkhand and the World Bank for socioeconomic empowerment of adolescent girls and young women. And Tejaswini has potential to provide sustainability and continuity for the young community leaders shaped by Sambhav.

With equal participation of adolescent girls and boys as their allies in 942 villages, the scale and the gender-transformative impact of Sambhav is unprecedented.

Sambhav worked with 47,000 adolescents between 14–18 years by establishing a girls’ and boys’ adolescent group in each village.

A youth who showed keen interest and leadership skills in each group was then groomed as a peer educator (PE) and trained in 10 life-skills modules such as decision making, problem solving, financial literacy and child rights & protection. The PEs cascaded these trainings down to their youth groups.

Sambhav also worked to fill gaps in forming and strengthening Child Protection Committees (CPCs).

Vibrant village and block level CPCs worked in tandem to identify and address child protection issues in their regular meetings. Parents were oriented and mobilised on child rights issues. Intergenerational dialogues were established to spark conversations at panchayat and block-level meetings that were pivotal in giving children the opportunity and support needed to voice their concerns.

Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Sahiyas were trained on CPC as well as other issues faced by adolescents. Their routine meetings were attended by Sambhav team members to drive AWWs to take on the health and nutritional issues of the adolescents.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/empowering-adolescents-transforming-lives.html
113,06-3-20,CRPF stitches economy in naxal-hit Palamu,"A company of CRPF deployed at a highly naxal stretch Dagra in Palamu district has turned out a friend in local trading and is stitching the rural economy of the locals there.

The CRPF company does business with the local growers -- be they are milk sellers or vegetable growers or chicken raisers.

Sources said a company has always around 60 to 70 combatants, while the numerical strength is 100 or 100 plus. This contingent needs milk, fruits, vegetables, eggs, chicken. The locals provide them food items of the market. Thus a bond of commerce emerges between the locals and the CRPF.

At Dagra camp the CRPF is adding to the pockets of the villagers. CRPF’s company commander here at Dagra Rajinder Singh Bhandari said, “ On an average we buy 40 litres of milk every day from the local cow owners here at Rs 40 per litre and that comes to 1,600 rupees a day and just multiply it for a month or one calendar year and see what amount of money is spent by us on this milk here and every rupee that we dole out bolsters the rural economy of the locals of Dagra.”

Bhandari said, “Summer is coming too fast. The demand for milk will further grow as jawans try making curd and lassi. We need more milk. We have stopped buying pouches of milk. We go for fresh milk now.” Beef is strictly banned and so CRPF jawans go for chicken here which is sold to us by the chicken growers here. Bhandari said jawans who do not eat chicken are given cheese. It comes too from the villagers.

CRPF officials get ghee from the villagers at Rs 500 rupees a Kg. A villager said, “Our ghee is of quality far from any adulteration as we know CRPF will not tolerate any tampering with ghee here.”

Sources said village vegetables here at Dagra stale veggies of big stores of the town as here villagers pluck their veggies out from their fields and sell them to the CRPF camp.

Bhandari said, “We buy fresh vegetables here. It consists of all from green chili to cauliflower, tomatoes to French beans, peas, saag, radish, kaddu ( louki), bhindee, brinjal, potatoes and spices like garlic, ginger coriander etc.”

Bhandari said, “Dagra is a piece of classic neglect. This shopping of us with the villagers has strengthened our bond with them. They find us as their great consumers of field products.”

Sources said it was the former DGP Jharkhand D K Pandey who had most encouraged jawans of the forward security posts across the State to develop trading with locals as a part of their strategy to win over their trust and also to get ground reports from the villagers with regard to extremists.

Commandant 134 battalion of CRPF whose company is deployed at Dagra camp A D Sharma said, “Our boys at Dagra have made the extremists cry for space as our presence has terribly deterred the extremists to indulge in any inanity there.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/crpf-stitches-economy-in-naxal-hit-palamu.html

119,06-3-20,"Ahead of Uddhav’s Ayodhya visit, train full of Shiv Sena activists leave for UP","Ahead of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s visit to Ayodhya on Saturday, a special train carrying Shiv Sena activists on Thursday afternoon left from Mumbai’s Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) to the temple town in Uttar Pradesh.

Amid vociferous slogans of ‘Jai Shri Ram’, ‘Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ki Jai’, ‘Uddhav Thackeray Zindabad’ raised by Shiv Sainiks, a special train – comprising 18 bogies – left from the LTT at Kurla in north-central Mumbai for Ayodhya at around 2 pm. The train will reach Ayodhya on Friday evening and leave from there to Mumbai on Saturday night.

Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will visit Ayodhya on March 7 on completion of the 100 days in office by Shiv Sena-headed Maha Vikas Aghadi government.

As per the schedule drawn up by the ruling Shiv Sena, Uddhav – along with Shiva Sainiks –will have darshan of Lord Shriram on Saturday afternoon. He will perform Aarati on the ghats of Sarayu river in the evening.

Uddhav’s visit is being seen as attempt to send a message across to the Sena cadres as well the Opposition BJP that the there is no erosion in his party’s Hindutva credentials even after forming a government with “secular” Congress and NCP.

Uddhav, who had announced after the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayoidhya dispute case that he would go once again Ayodhya on November 24, 2019, had postponed his visit then, owing to the impasse in the government formation in the state. The public perception was that the Sena would soft-peddle its Hindutva agenda as long as it is running the Government in the state with the Congress and NCP.

It may be recalled that Uddhav had on November 25, 2018 – along with his wife Rashmi and son Aditya, had visited Ayodhya. On June 16, 2019 year after the Lok Sabha polls, he once again visited Ayodhya and offered prayers at the makeshift Ram Lalla shrine.

However, atmosphere has changed after he joined hands with the “secular” and NCP to form a Maha Vikas Agadhi government in Maharashtra. The perception that has been gaining ground in the state political circles that in order to ensure that there is no threat to its government in the state the ruling Shiv Sena is not pursuing the Hindutva as vigorously as it was doing earlier. So much so that its erstwhile ally BJP has been taking pot shots at the Shiv Sena for giving up on its Hindutva agenda for the sake of power.

It is in the backdrop that Uddhav has scheduled his visit to Ayodhya on the occasion of his government completing 100 days in office. Asked if his party’s alliance partners NCP and Congress were reacting to his impending visit to Ayodhya, Uddhav had said early this week: “Whoever wants to join me to Ayodhya, they can do so. After all God is God. The God’s door is open for all. Whoever wants to join me, they can do so or they can go earlier than me”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ahead-of-uddhav---s-ayodhya-visit--train-full-of-shiv-sena-activists-leave-for-up.html

121,06-3-20,MVA to name it as Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj Airport,"Within days of its spat with the Opposition BJP over the issue of renaming of Aurangabad city after Maratha warrior Sambhaji Maharaj, the Shiv Sena-led MVA Government on Thursday announced its decision to name the Aurangabad airport as the Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj Airport.

In an announcement made in the State Assembly, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said: “There have been lots of requests from the elected representatives that the Aurangabad airport be named after Sambhaji Maharaj. The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation has also passed a resolution that the local airport be name ‘Dharmaveer Raje Sambhaji Bhosale Airport’.”

“At a State Cabinet meeting held today, we have approved the proposal to name airport as the Chattrapati Sambhaji Maharaj Airport. After obtaining the consent from both the Houses of the State Legislature, we will be making a formal request to the Civil Aviation Ministry on the naming of the Aurangabad airport as the Chattrapati Sambhaji Maharaj Airport,” the Chief Minister said. The MVA Government’s decision to go ahead and recommend the naming of Aurangabad airport should be seen in the context of the fact a case relating to the reaming of Aurangabad city is pending before the Supreme Court.

BJP’s State President Chandrakant Patil had on Saturday last rooted for renaming of Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar, by saying: “We are descendants of Maratha warriors Chhatrapati Shivaji Mahataj and Sambhaji Maharaj and not of Aurangazeb. Hence, Aurangabad should be named after Sambhaji Maharaj”.

Through an editorial published in its official mouth-piece “Saamana”, the Shiv Sena on Tuesday hit back at the Shiv Sena, by saying: “The BJP has been invoking the name of Shivaji for the past five years. It has become so arrogant that it has published a book that Prime Minister Modi is himself Shivaji Maharaj... It is now demanding that Aurangabad should be renamed as Sambhajinagar. Who prevented (former chief minister Devendra) from renaming Aurangabad after Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj?”.

“From when BJP’s Dadamiya (Patil) has become a historian? If he really likes to be historian, he should have known Hinduhriday Samrat” Balasaheb Thackeray had renamed Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar 25 years ago. He had said: from now on Aurangabad would be known as Sambhajinagar. From thereon every Hindu with self-pride used to call Aurangabad as Sambhajingar,” the editorial had said.

Interestingly enough, the Shiv Sena and BJP had been ruling the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) as an alliance for the past three decades. However, the situation has changed in Aurangabad after the Shiv Sena severed its ties with the BJP in December last year in the wake of the Sena joining hands with the NCP and Congress to form the MVA government in the state.

For the first time, the Shiv Sena will contest the AMC polls to be held in the next few weeks in alliance with the NCP and Congress against the BJP. It is no wonder that the Shiv Sena – much to the discomfort of the BJPb-- wants to cash in on its decision to name Aurangabad airport after Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj.

Reacting to the MVA Government’s decision to name Aurangabad airport as Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj Airport, senior BJP leader Asish Shelar charged that the ruling Shiv Sena was running away from the much-discussed demand for naming the Aurangabad city after Sambhaji Maharaj.

“The AMC elections are round the corner. The Shiv Sena realises that if it decides to name Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar, its alliance partners NCP and Congress might oppose the move. Hence, the Shiv Sena has taken an easy way out of the situation by deciding to name the local airport after Sambhaji Maharaj. This is nothing but running away from the actual demand”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mva-to-name-it-as-chhatrapati-sambhaji-maharaj-airport.html
122,06-3-20,Not all is well with registrar office at Indore collector’s premises,"Hundreds of people are facing problem in the registrar office located at the Indore collector premises as they have to wait for hours for their turn for documentation of their registry.

The major problems are faced by women and senior citizens who come to registrar office. There are 5 offices of sub registrar in this hall where the people were free to go anywhere or at any registrar office for their registry documentation and especially where there is less crowd but now the district registrar administration has ordered for people coming from different tehsils to go at only one registrar office hence it results in long queue and hours of waiting for the people to get their registry done and sometime when the time is over they have to again come at another day.

Indore district is spread in 3 tehsils, Mhow, Depalpur and Sanwer tehsils. The outskirts of Indore district is connected to all these tehsils area and lots of colonies are coming up in this tehsils area and for this the buyer and seller both come to registry office located at the Indore collector office campus. But now the government has fixed one sub registrar office for the people coming from Mhow Depalpur and Sanwer tehsils. Hence there is a long queue at one office and rest 4 offices are empty and have very less work.

The inspector general of registration Amit Rathod told The Pioneer that it is the old order of the Government to get the registry of the different tehsils done at one registrar office and regarding this there was a dispute in Khandwa also so we have implemented this order strictly but in case of Indore as it is a big densely populated city I will review in Indore and see that how many registries are coming from different tehsil office and then take further action.

District Registrar Balkrishna Mourya told The Pioneer that we are examining the footfall and number of registries coming from different tehsil area and if we see that there is long queue at one office we will allow different sub registrar office to start the registry of different tehsil also. People told that due to corona virus the experts suggest that there should be no formation of large gathering and big crowd as it is now a day’s big crowd is prevailing in the registry hall and hence the registry documentation of different tehsils should be opened to the sub registrar as earlier.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/not-all-is-well-with-registrar-office-at-indore-collector---s-premises.html

131,06-3-20,"Rajinikanth opts out of CM post, cadre disagree","nFilm star Rajinikanth , who is on the verge of launching a political party is believed to have told the office bearers of his proposed outfit that he would not be the Chief Ministerial candidate in the eventuality of the party winning the 2021 Assembly election.

Political pundits in Tamil Nadu are seriously discussing the reason for the ‘disappointment’of Rajinikanth who had a two-hour long meeting on Thursday with the district-level office bearers of Rajini Makkal Manram (his fans organisation) at Chennai.

“We had a fruitful inter-active session. They asked many questions and I clarified and explained the issues. But I was disappointed by one of the issues raised by them,” said Rajinikanth while speaking to reporters after the meeting.

He refused to divulge more details about the cause of disappointment and said he would disclose the issue later. “It is not proper to discuss what transpired in the meeting today. I’ll reveal the details at a later stage,” the actor told journalists after the meeting.

But RMM members who took part in the closed door meeting said that Rajinikanth told them that 60 to 65 per cent of the 234 Assembly constituencies from where the proposed outfit would contest will be allocated to persons below the age of 45.

“This was unanimously accepted by all of us. But Thalaivar (Rajinikanth) further stated that he would not be the chief minister if the party wins the election. This was not acceptable to us,” said one of the office bearers.

Stage has been set for launching the political outfit to be led by the actor. Office bearers of RMM said that details like the name of the party and programmes were discussed in the meeting held at the marriage hall owned by the actor. It is widely rumoured that Rajinikanth would announce the name of the party and other details on April 15, the Tamil New Year Day.

Rajinikanth, who had a meeting last Sunday with the representatives of various Islamist organizations in the State who are agitating against the CAA, NPR and NRC , said he was willing to facilitate a meeting between the agitators and union Home Minister Amit Shah so that any misgivings about the Act could be cleared.

Kaja Moideen Bakavi, head, Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organizations, who led the delegation that met the actor had claimed that Rajinikanth understood the merit in their arguments against the CAA.

But the actor said on Thursday that he gave a patient hearing to the views expressed by the delegation and assured them that if they so wanted a meeting with the Union Home Minister could be facilitated to clear their doubts. Interestingly many political outfits including the BJP and the PMK has expressed their willingness to align with the political party to be launched by

Rajinikanth.

“There is apolitical vacuum in Tamil Nadi following the untimely demise of Jayalalithaa,the AIADMK supremo. The DMK too is rudderless since the death of party president MKarunanidhi. People are waiting in anticipation for the arrival of a fresh face in the scene andRajinikanth fits the bill,” said Govindarajan Satyamurthy, political observer and author.

Voters in TamilNadu would elect a new assembly in April-May 2021 as the tenure of the current legislatureis coming to an end in May 2020. Rajinikanth had said earlier that the outfit to be launched by him would contestall the 234 seats in the 2021 assembly election.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rajinikanth-opts-out-of-cm-post--cadre-disagree.html
132,06-3-20,Cong terms it as ‘dictatorial decision’ by Govt,"The Congress on Thursday alleged that the suspension of its seven members from Lok Sabha was a “dictatorial decision” by the Government aimed at weakening the Opposition’s demand for a debate on Delhi riots in Parliament.

Reacting to the development, Congress’ leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said it was a “Government decision” and not one taken by the Speaker. “We got to see spirit of revenge in the House. Order was given to suspend seven of our MPs for the session by a chairperson, not the Speaker,” he said.

“The aim is that we become weak in the discussion on Delhi riots. The Government is scared to discuss the Delhi riots. This is a dictatorial decision of the Government,” he said.

He said the people will decide whether suspending seven members is right or not. “We, Congress workers, are not afraid, (and) if you think by suspending our seven MPs, we will not demand a discussion about the Delhi riots, it will not happen,” Chowdhury said.

Describing the suspension as a “tale of embarrassment for parliamentary democracy”, he said the Opposition will not be weakened in its resolve and will continue to seek immediate discussion on Delhi riots.

Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said it was a “black day” in the functioning of Parliament. “This reflects utter dictatorship of the Government as also complete failure of the Speaker in protecting the rights of the Members of Parliament in holding the government accountable to the law of this country as also to the Parliament,” he said.

Surjewala asked why can’t the Government and The Prime Minister answer the questions raised by the Opposition over the Delhi riots.

Senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP P Chidambaram said MPs sometimes lose their cool when there is grave provocation and in such cases, the House must consider both the provocation and the reaction.

Asked if the Congress will take up the matter with the Speaker, Chowdhury said, “We have a very cordial relation with Speaker but we cannot let ourselves to be beggars. We have not committed any wrong by demanding the discussion on a very sensitive issue in our country.” Gogoi, who was among the suspended MPs, said, “Suspend us for a year, but discuss the Delhi riots and heal the wounds of people.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-terms-it-as----dictatorial-decision----by-govt.html

Doval was deputed to take stock of the situation on the ground late last month following which he also briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“In a democracy, it is extremely important to be totally dedicated to the law. You should be doing things fairly and objectively and it is also important that you are seen as credible,” Doval said.

Doval further told the police officers: “Law-making is the most sacrosanct job in a democracy. It is not done by an imperial ruler or from the pulpit of a religious leader but by the representatives of the people and you are the enforcers of that law.”

“If you (police) fail, democracy fails,” Doval said while inaugurating the ‘Third Young Superintendents of Police Conference’ organised in Gurgaon by the BPR&D, a national police think tank.

“If police personnel are not able to enforce the law, then framing of that law is immaterial. A law is as good as it is executed on the ground,” the NSA underscored.

“The day the society starts realising that the property of the police or the police vehicles one has burnt is actually people’s money, it will bring about a societal change,” the NSA added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/police-should-be-seen-as-credible--fair--nsa-doval.html
136,06-3-20,ED books Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal in money laundering case,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has booked Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal and others in a money laundering case and conducted searches at his premises.

Officials said a criminal case against the former chairman of the airlines has been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after taking cognisance of a recent Mumbai Police FIR filed against him.

The agency conducted searches at Goyal’s premises in Mumbai on Wednesday and also questioned him, they said.

The Mumbai Police FIR relates to charges of alleged fraud by Goyal and others against a Mumbai-based travel company.

Goyal was earlier been grilled by the ED in a case filed under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in September last year.

The agency had carried out similar searches, under FEMA, in August last year against Goyal, his family and others. ED has alleged in the past that the businessman’s empire had 19 privately-held companies, including five incorporated abroad.

The agency is probing allegations that these firms allegedly carried out “doubtful” transactions under the guise of selling, distribution and operating expenses. The ED suspects that expenses at these companies were allegedly fake and at inflated costs which in turn “projected” huge losses.

Alleged shady aircraft lease transactions with non-existent offshore entities are also under the ED scanner. The agency suspects that Jet Airways made payments for lease rental to “ghost firms”, which purportedly routed the ill-gotten money in Goyal’s companies.

137,06-3-20,"No case in Maha, don’t panic, but caution needed: Uddhav","Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said no case of coronavirus infection has been found in the State and there was no cause for panic, but caution was necessary for the next eight to ten days.

Addressing a press conference here, he also said people should refrain from visiting crowded places.

“Extra precaution is needed to be taken during the next eight to ten days....People should celebrate the Holi festival in a restrained way,” he said.

The medical staff at the airports will be increased for conducting thermal screening of all the passengers arriving from other countries, Thackeray said.

Thermal checking is being carried out at Nagpur and Pune airports in the state too, he said.

Mumbai municipal commissioner Pravin Pardeshi, also present at the press conference, said additional quarantine beds have been kept ready at private hospitals in the city.

Pardeshi also stated that people need not wear face masks, which the medical staff who are treating suspected coronavirus patients need.

Some 18,000 passengers arrive at the international airport in Mumbai every day, the commissioner said. So far about 70,000 passengers have undergone thermal checking and 90 of them showed symptoms of the disease. But 83 of these patients eventually tested negative for the virus while the lab reports of seven people were awaited, Pardeshi added.

Earlier, making a statement in the Legislative Assembly, Chief Minister Thackeray said his Government was taking all necessary steps for the prevention of the “coronavirus epidemic”.

“I want to tell people that the next eight days are crucial and we have to remain cautious,” he told the House.

“We need to tackle the crisis effectively without getting scared and panicky,” he said. “If we get scared, we may end up committing avoidable mistakes,” he added.

Adequate testing facilities were in place in Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune, the chief minister said.

“There is enough stock of masks. We need to see if the vacant Seven Hills Hospital in Mumbai can be used for quarantine facilities,” he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-case-in-maha--don---t-panic--but-caution-needed--uddhav.html

Rupani said a patient’s sample sent for coronavirus test on Wednesday has come out negative. Several people, including 87 who recently came back to Gujarat from Iran, are currently kept under observation in the State.

“No positive case of coronavirus has been registered in Gujarat. The State Government has made elaborate arrangements for the treatment of those suspected to be having such symptoms,” Rupani told reporters in Gandhinagar.

A woman patient, who had travelled to Singapore and developed cough and cold, was referred to the Ahmedabad civil hospital by a private hospital.

However, her sample tested negative and she was discharged, authorities at the civil hospital said. “Even if someone is suspected to be having the infection, the government will ensure that he/she is taken to an isolation ward. Screening of those coming from outside is going on at the airports in Ahmedabad and Surat,” Rupani said.

There is no need to panic as the state has enough stock of medicine and isolation facilities, he added.

Rupani urged people to follow the advisories issued from time to time by the Centre and the state government on personal hygiene.

He also asked people that if they fall sick, they should immediately contact government health agencies and even use ‘fever helpline’ number 104 of the state government, which will assist them.

141,06-3-20,Ukrainian divers recover weapon from seabed,"In a sophisticated operation, the CBI scoured through 40-feet of sand at the seabed in a creek near Thane to recover a gun which might be the clinching evidence in the killing of rationalists including Narendra Dabholkar, officials said on Thursday.

The agency relied on the expertise of a Dubai-based company—Envitech Marine Consultants—which used hi-tech Norwegian equipment and Ukrainian divers to detect the gun in a 40-feet thick layer of sand on the seabed in an operation that cost Rs 7.5 crore, to be shared by the governments of Karnataka and Maharashtra. Rationalists Dabholkar, Gauri Lankesh, MM Kalburgi and Govind Pansare were shot dead in similar fashion allegedly by right wing extremists, they said.

The agency is probing the killing of Dabholkar who was allegedly shot dead on August 20, 2013 in Pune by members of Sanatan Sanstha, a right wing extremist group, whereas the Karnataka police is investigating the murders of Kalburgi, Lankesh and Pansare, they said.

“The weapon will be sent for ballistic tests which will give a clear picture whether it was used in Dabholkar’s murder or any other case. Meanwhile, the search operation is still going on to locate other weapons used in similar murders,” an official said.

Initial reports indicate the killers’ modus operandi being similar in all the four cases and that the killings may have some common actors, they said.

Alleged shooter in the Dabholkar case, Sharad Kalaskar, has claimed to have thrown four weapons used in the murders in the creek on the directions of a Sanatan Sanstha member, the agency had said.

Finding a gun in the huge creek area meant managing through tides, looking into dirty water, rocks and sand in the seabed as the suspected weapon could have been at any depth of sand, officials said.

After the interrogation of suspects, the agency narrowed the area where they had thrown their respective weapons from the bridge.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ukrainian-divers-recover-weapon-from-seabed.html
142,06-3-20,Coimbatore tense following attack on Hindu Front leader,"Coimbatore in south west Tamil Nadu wore a tense look on Thursday following the attack on Madukkarai Anand (32), district secretary of Hindu Front (an umbrella organisation of all Hindu outfits in the State) late Wednesday night.

Two motor cycle-borne miscreants attacked Anand with iron rods, knives and swords while he was returning home after attending a pro CAA rally staged at Gandhipuram, a suburb in the communally sensitive Coimbatore city. “He was seriously injured and was admitted to a private hospital where his condition continues to be serious. Our suspicion is centred on activists of Islamic organisations which have been demonstrating against the CAA,” said J S Kishore Kumar, Tamil Nadu Secretary, Hindu Front.

The police have registered a FIR and investigation is on to find out the culprits behind the attack. The Hindu Front has called for a dawn to dusk hartal in Coimbatore district to condemn the attack on Anand, a full time activist of the organization. The call for hartal was given by C Subramaniam, president , Hindu Front, Tamil Nadu.

This is the first attack on Hindu activists after the eruption of widespread agitation against the CAA staged by various Islamic outfits. The State is witnessing rallies and demonstrations supporting and opposing the new citizen bill. Barring the unpleasant incidents in Chennai in which more than six policemen were grievously injured by a mob staging demonstration against the CAA, the protest marches have been by and large peaceful all over the State.

A police official probing the attack on Anand pointed out that the situation in Coimbatore had turned tense following the passing of the CAA.

143,06-3-20,PM Mission Parivartan for Bengal: Holds 1-to-1 meet with BJP MPs,"In a lead up to BJP’s “Mission Parivartan” (change) in Bengal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held exclusive meetings with the saffron MPs from the State gathering from them various information about their constituencies including those on the impact of Central Government schemes which were being opposed tooth and nail by the Mamata Banerjee Government.

“The Prime Minister has wanted to know about general political and social condition of the State,” Malda MP Khagen Murmu who met Modi said adding the one-to-one meetings were aimed at the bigger cause of Mission Parivartan in the State.

The Prime Minister’s initiative — reportedly rare of its kind — underscores the importance the BJP attaches to Bengal politics particularly at a time when quite a few states have gone out of its hand in the recent months. Remarkably the BJP won 18 out of 42 parliamentary seats in the last year’s general elections wresting a whole majority of them from the Trinamool Congress. The State ruling outfit had won 22 seats winning couple of them by a wafer thin margin.

The MPs who have met Modi have discussed threadbare the issues concerning their regions. State party president Dilip Ghosh who is also the sitting MP from Midnapore, said, “Our task is pretty much cut out. We are lucky to be guided by our top brass who have their ears strongly to the ground.”

The BJP’s “goal is well defined --- Bengal needs ‘parivartan’ (change),” Murmu the Malda North MP and CPI(M) discard said.

The BJP’s urgency to wrest Bengal at a time when the party is shedding states one after another becomes all the more manifest from Darjeeling MP Raju Bista’s comment. He quoted the Prime Minister as saying: “desh ke hit mein Bengal jeetna hi hoga (it is important to win Bengal in the interest of the nation).”

Evidently the BJP like many other parties seems to be influenced and enthused by Bengal voters’ characteristic slowness towards bringing inpolitical change in the State. While the Left ruled the state for more than three decades, the Congress lasted from about 23 years. The TMC has been ruling for the past nine years or so and expects to win the state for the third term.

While BJP president JP Nadda recently held a meeting with the state party leaders exhorting them to target at least 200 out of the 294 seats Union Home Minister Amit Shah too spoke in a public rally on March 1 that his part was all set to bag not less than 200 seats.

While Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee would not react to the Prime Minister’s meeting with his party MPs (though she dared Shah to turn his words into votes) the Left and the Congress condemned the BJP and the TMC for polarizing the State politics.

“They are trying to divide the electorate along communal lines. Mamata Banerjee shouts loud in public but parties with Amit Shah in private. When Delhi was burning she was having breakfast with Shah in

Bhubaneshwar.

“She has stopped speaking against the Prime Minister and Shah because she knows that her neck is in their clasp. With the investigations in Sharada and other scams leading up to the topmost TMC brass she can’tresist BJP. She will have to cede power to them. So she is hoodwinkingthe people by maintaining her double standards,” said former CPI(M) MP Samik Lahiri.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm-mission-parivartan-for-bengal--holds-1-to-1-meet-with-bjp-mps.html
144,06-3-20,SC refuses to allow Delhi violence victim to intervene in hate speech case by activist,"The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to allow a victim of the recent Delhi violence to intervene in a matter in which the Centre has raised the issue of alleged hate speeches by activist Harsh Mander during anti-CAA protests.

Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves mentioned the matter before a Bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde and said the riot victim wanted to intervene in the Harsh Mander case, which is scheduled to be heard on Friday.

“We will not allow you to intervene,” Bobde told the advocate. Gonsalves said he had seen the video of an alleged hate speech by Mander and wanted to place it on record.

“We had asked the solicitor general to put it (video of alleged hate speech by Mander) on record. We don’t need you in that proceeding,” the Chief Justice of India (CJI) said.

When Gonsalves said he had appeared for Mander before the high court in the Delhi violence matter, the Bench said, “You can appear for him here also.”

The Delhi Police had on Wednesday filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court against Mander and sought initiation of contempt proceedings against him for alleged “derogatory remarks” making insinuations against the apex court and its judges.

The affidavit was filed after the Centre’s allegation before the Supreme Court that Mander, who has sought registering of FIRs against some BJP leaders for their alleged hate speeches that purportedly led to the violence in Delhi, himself had made certain objectionable remarks against the top court, “majesty of law”, the Government and Parliament.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-refuses-to-allow-delhi-violence-victim-to-intervene-in-hate-speech-case-by-activist.html
145,06-3-20,UK court rejects Nirav’s bail plea for fifth time,"A UK court on Thursday rejected for the fifth time the bail plea of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, who is fighting his extradition to India on charges over the nearly $2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case.

Justice Ian Dove, who presided over the bail hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice, also concluded that the 49-year-old jeweller continued to pose a risk of absconding.

This was the fifth attempt at bail by Modi, who has been lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest in March last year and is scheduled for an extradition trial between May 11 and 15.

He appeared via videolink from prison as his legal team offered a package of “stringent” bail measures, including bail security of 4 million pound, house arrest with a 24-hour electronic tag as well as a private security guard service and a strictly monitored access to gadgets and telephones.

“There are risks involved with this applicant and the question for the court is are those risks adequately guarded against,” noted Justice Dove.

“My central concern of a risk of absconding are not obviated by the measures presented,” he ruled, adding that he was unsatisfied with the arrangements presented to the court adequately contained the risks posed in the very “substantial case” of fraud and money laundering.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) barrister Nick Hearn, arguing on behalf of the Indian government, had reiterated that Modi continues to remain a flight risk and that any additional measures offered for his bail would not make a breach “impossible”.

Modi’s barrister, Edward Fitzgerald, argued that an offer to pay for a security guard from a reputable crisis management company offered “house arrest with effective room arrest” at his luxury apartment at Centre Point in London.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/uk-court-rejects-nirav---s-bail-plea-for-fifth-time.html

A rising propensity for personal loans and attractive risk-adjusted returns are the possible reasons driving the non-banking finance companies (NBFC) to grow on such loans, domestic rating agency Crisil said.

The going has been very difficult for the NBFC segment since the crisis at infra-focused lender IL&FS in September 2018, with liquidity getting scarce and the economy slowing down.

149,06-3-20,China virus could cost airlines $113 bn revenue in 2020: IATA,"The airline industry could lose up to $113 billion in revenue this year due to the impact of the new coronavirus, an industry body warned Thursday, as the epidemic spreads rapidly worldwide.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated revenue losses to airlines’ passenger business of between $63 billion and $ 113 billion — with the higher figure for a scenario where the virus spreads more widely.

The more dire prediction amounts to a 19 per cent loss in worldwide passenger revenues, IATA said.

“Financially, that would be on a scale equivalent to what the industry experienced in the global financial crisis,” said a statement from the group.

It was a far bleaker assessment than two weeks ago, when IATA forecast revenue losses would come in at $29.3 billion. But since then the virus has spread rapidly outside China, where it first emerged late last year, and has now reached some 80 countries and territories.

More than 95,000 people have been infected and over 3,200 have died worldwide.

“The turn of events as a result of COVID-19 is almost without precedent,” said IATA head Alexandre de Juniac, following a meeting in Singapore.

150,06-3-20,Bombay dismisses Kochhar’s plea against termination of employment,"The Bombay High Court on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by Chanda Kochhar against her termination as managing director and CEO of the ICICI Bank, noting the dispute arises from a contract of personal service.

A division Bench of Justices NM Jamdar and MS Karnik accepted the bank’s contention that Kochhar’s petition was not maintainable as the dispute was contractual and concerns a private body.

“The termination of the petitioner is in the realm of contractual relationship,” the court said in its order.

Courts cannot exercise their writ jurisdiction when employment in a private entity is regulated by contracts, it further said.

“Contractual duties are enforceable as matters of private law by ordinary contractual remedies such as damages, injunction, specific performance and declaration,” the high court said. The Bench in its order noted that even if an institution is performing a public duty and is amenable to writ jurisdiction, all its decisions would not be subject to judicial review.

“If the private body is discharging a public function and the denial of any right is in connection with the public duty imposed on such body, the public law remedy can be enforced,” the court said.

It took note of the fact that ICICI was a private bank governed by a board of directors and did not receive any funds from the government.

The ICICI Bank’s counsel Darius Khambata earlier argued that a judicial review cannot be incurred under Article 226 of the Constitution, which empowers high courts to issue directions, orders or writs in such a matter. The bank sought dismissal of Kochhar’s petition. Kochhar was terminated from the ICICI Bank months after she voluntarily left the second largest private sector lender. The high-profile former banker moved the high court on November 30, 2019, challenging “termination” of her employment by the ICICI Bank.

She contended that the bank also denied her remuneration and clawed back all the bonuses and stock options between April 2009 and March 2018, for her alleged role in granting out of turn loans worth Rs 3,250 crore to the Videocon Group which benefitted her husband Deepak Kochhar.Kochhar’s counsel Vikram Nankani earlier argued that her termination came months after the bank approved her voluntary resignation on October 5, 2018 and therefore, the termination is “illegal, untenable and unsustainable in law”.

The ICICI Bank then filed an affidavit, contending the reliefs in the petition are not maintainable and it deserves to be dismissed as ICICI is a private bank and is administered under the Companies Act, not the state or its agency.

Khambata argued that ICICI was a private banking company and Kochhar’s petition seeks to contest what are purely private contractual terms.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/bombay-dismisses-kochhar---s-plea-against-termination-of-employment.html
151,06-3-20,Coronavirus wipes $50bn off global exports in Feb,"UN economists announced a likely $50 billion drop in the worldwide manufacturing exports in February alone as the extent of the damage to the global economy caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) moved further into focus.

Citing the China Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI), Pamela Coke-Hamilton, who heads UNCTAD’s Division on International Trade and Commodities, said that it had fallen to 37.5 - a drop of about 20 points – the lowest reading since 2004.

“This also correlates directly to exports and also implies a two per cent drop in overall exports,” she said, with a resulting “ripple effect” worldwide “to the tune of a $50 billion fall in exports.”

Because China has become the main supplier of finished products and so-called “intermediate” products used in countless industries — from chemical for pharmaceuticals to parts for digital cameras and the car industry — concerns about the long-term disruption to supply chains there, has left many companies around the world “fearful” that their own output may soon be affected, UNCTAD said.

“Of course, if the virus continues to spread and gets out of control, and we see closures not only in China but also in India and the United States and everywhere else in the world, then it would be a big problem,” said Alessandro Nicita from UNCTAD’s Division on International Trade and Commodities.

“Ultimately, the economic impact of this virus depends on the measures that countries apply to contain the virus. So, China has done a great job in containing the virus, but it has sacrificed a little bit the economy, at least in the first few weeks. So, planned closures, restriction to movement of people, which were all necessary; but there is an economic effect when you take those measures.”

In addition to the falling manufacturing levels, UNCTAD also highlighted a decrease in the number of container ships leaving Shanghai in the first half of February (from around 300 a week to 180), which then returned to normal levels in the second half of the month.

“Right now, the impact on the global value chains is already being felt and will continue probably for a few months,” Coke-Hamilton said.

“But if it rebounds, say in the next few months, then the long-term or year-long impact will be a little different and will be better. So, it depends on what happens in China.”

In remarks made at a joint press conference with the head of the World Bank Group, the IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, said that the UN-backed global funds would make up the shortfall, in effect, by offering to inject around USD 50 billion into low-income and emerging market nations, pending requests for support.

“Thanks to the generosity of our shareholders, we have about USD 1 trillion in overall lending capacity,” she said.

“For low-income countries, we have rapid-di bursing emergency financing of up to $10 billion (50 per cent of quota of eligible members) that can be accessed without a full-fledged IMF programme,” she added. The IMF chief added that members can access emergency financing through the Rapid Financing Instrument.

“This facility could provide about $40 billion for emerging markets that could potentially approach us for financial support. We also have the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust – the CCRT – which provides eligible countries with up-front grants for relief on IMF debt service falling due.

“The CCRT proved to be effective during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, but is now underfunded with just over $200 million available against possible needs of over $1 billion.”

She called on member countries “to help ensure that this facility is fully re-charged and ready for the current crisis”, and said that the Fund was “fully committed to supporting our member countries, particularly the most vulnerable. We have the tools to help and we are coordinating closely with our partner institutions.”",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/coronavirus-wipes--50bn-off-global-exports-in-feb.html
152,06-3-20,‘SBI-led consortium to take over Yes Bank’,"The government has given the go-ahead to State Bank of India and other financial institutions to take over capital-starved Yes Bank, and an announcement is likely to be made soon, highly placed sources said on Thursday. The board of SBI, the country’s largest lender, is meeting in Mumbai on Thursday, but it could not be immediately ascertained whether takeover of Yes Bank is on the agenda.

Yes Bank, which is grappling with bad loans, is looking to raise fresh capital but the plans are facing uncertainties. It has also delayed announcement of 2019 December 2019 quarter results due to the ongoing crisis. The bank’s capital buffers have come down due to non-performing assets. The sources said the government has cleared a plan for a SBI-led consortium to acquire a controlling stake in the bank. In a clarification to stock exchanges on reports that the government is said to have approved SBI’s plan to buy stake in Yes Bank, the state-owned lender said it would disclose developments, if any, as per Sebi regulations. “... we will abide by the timelines under Regulation 30 of Sebi (LODR) Regulations 2015 in disclosing the developments, if any in the matter to stock exchanges,” it added. Yes Bank said it would like to clarify that as on date, the bank has not received any such communication from RBI or any other government or regulatory authorities or from the SBI. “... we are unaware of any such decision. Therefore, we are not in a position to comment on such news item,” Yes Bank said in a filing to the stock exchanges.

The bourses had sought clarification the reports. Further, Yes Bank said in the usual and ordinary course of its business continues to explore various means of raising capital/ funds through issuance of securities to diverse set of investors to meet its business or regulatory requirements. The bank also said that it would keep stock exchanges updated on disclosures required to be made under Sebi regulations. Yes Bank has been passing through a tumultuous period ever since the Reserve Bank, in August 2018, asked the then chief executive Rana Kapoor to leave by January 31, 2019, amid concerns on governance and loan practices. Under his successor Ravneet Gill, the lender has disclosed large under-reported stressed assets. The bank reported its maiden loss in the March 2019 quarter. Yes Bank had initially planned to raise capital of over USD 2 billion in the current fiscal. Later, its board rejected a USD 1.2 billion investment in the bank by Canadian investor SPGP Group/ Erwin Singh Braich.

Mumbai-headquartered Yes Bank was incorporated in 2004. The bank’s asset size stood at Rs 3,71,160 crore at the end of June 2019. Promoters of Yes Bank — Madhu Kapur, Yes Capital (India) Pvt Ltd and Mags Finvest — hold 8.33 per cent stake in the crisis-ridden bank, as per data available on the stock exchanges. The bank’s co-founder Rana Kapoor has sold his entire stake in the bank. Besides, foreign portfolio investors hold 15.17 per cent stake, state-owned LIC has 8.06 per cent, and mutual funds own 5.09 per cent.

154,06-3-20,Equities eke out gains; SBI spurts on takeover buzz,"Markets surrendered most of their early gains to end modestly higher on Thursday as investors weighed the impact of rising coronavirus cases in the country. After rallying over 478 points during the day, the 30-share BSE Sensex settled 61.13 points or 0.16 per cent higher at 38,470.61. On similar lines, the broader NSE Nifty advanced 18 points or 0.16 per cent to finish at 11,269.

Kotak Mahindra Bank was the top gainer among the Sensex constituents, climbing 2.74 per cent, followed by HCL Tech, TCS, Bharti Airtel, HUL and Asian Paints. SBI jumped 1.05 per cent following reports that the government has given the go-ahead to the lender and other financial institutions to take over capital-starved Yes Bank. Laggards included RIL, Tech Mahindra, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, dropping up to 2.06 per cent.

According to analysts, despite trading significantly higher through the day on positive global cues, markets failed to hold on to most gains as domestic investors turned increasingly risk averse amid rising cases of coronavirus in the country. One more case of novel coronavirus was reported in the national capital region on Thursday, taking the total number in the country to 30 so far, including 16 Italian tourists.

Global stocks rallied as investors were hopeful that the collective efforts of global governments and central banks would cushion the economic blowback of the coronavirus epidemic. The IMF on Wednesday said it will make available about USD 50 billion through its rapid-disbursing emergency financing facilities for low income and emerging market countries that could potentially seek support on account of the coronavirus.

“Fund allocated by IMF and easing monetary measures is marginally supporting global markets but India is underperforming due to suspected virus cases. Foreign investors continued to sell with a notion that epidemic effect will be more on emerging markets. “Volatility is expected to persist, issues related to telecom and weak asset quality of banks could hurt market for short to medium term,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

BSE telecom, FMCG, consumer durables, bankex, teck, healthcare and capital goods indices ended up to 1.21 per cent higher, while energy, realty, metal, oil and gas, power and utilities ended in the red. Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices settled 0.31 per cent higher. Bourses in China, Shanghai, Seoul and Tokyo ended with robust gains, while those in Europe fell up to 1 per cent in early trade.

Brent crude oil futures inched up 0.04 per cent to USD 51.16 per barrel.

156,06-3-20,Lenders approve Rs 23K crore resolution plan for RCom; major share for Chinese banks,"With lenders approving a Rs 23,000 crore resolution plan for Reliance Communication, as much as Rs 5,500 crore will flow to Chinese banks, clearing about 55 per cent of their principal dues, including of those lenders to whom firm’s promoter Anil Ambani had allegedly given a personal guarantee. In a regulatory filing, RCom said “that in the e-voting conducted pursuant to the meeting of the committee of creditors held on March 2, 2020, which e-voting concluded on March 4, 2020 at 8 pm (IST), the committee of creditors of RCOM has, by way of voting share of 100 per cent of the committee of creditors, approved the resolution plan submitted by UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited.

“Further, in respect of the subsidiaries of RCOM, i e, Reliance Telecom Limited and Reliance Infratel Limited, which are also undergoing corporate insolvency resolution process under the provisions of the Code, resolution plans submitted by UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited, and (Jio’s subidiary) Reliance Digital Platform & Project Services Limited through its division Infrastructure Projects respectively, have been approved by the committee of creditors of each of the aforesaid companies by 100 per cent voting share,” it said.

It, however, did not give details saying the plans will be submitted to the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal for final nod. While Reliance Jio will get the tower and fiber assets of Reliance Infratel Ltd for Rs 4,700 crore, UV Asset Reconstruction Co Ltd (UVARC) will get assets of RCom and Reliance Telecom (spectrum) for Rs 14,000 crore, they said.

After considering a clawback clause, the resolution plan fetched Rs 23,000 crore, which will go towards paying dues of Chinese banks, who are the largest lenders, they said, adding Chinese banks will receive Rs 5,500 crore and their principal debt would stand reduced to Rs 4,500 crore. Against the alleged personal-guarantee of one debt, the Chinese banks would receive Rs 1,800 crore

(USD 250 million) and their exposure will reduce by 55 per cent to USD 300 million (Rs 2,200 crore).

The Chinese banks — Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd, China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China — had dragged Ambani to the UK court to recover outstanding. The sources said the total principal secured debt of banks is around Rs 33,000 crore.

Under the plan, 38 lenders of RCom can recover over 70 per cent of their outstanding of Rs 33,000 crore secured debt, they said. “The committee of creditors (COC) has approved the resolution plans of RCOM and its subsidiaries RTL and RITL with an absolute majority of 100 per cent by the lenders at the COC meeting, as against the mandatory requirement of 66 per cent,” a source said. Lenders submitted claims of around Rs 49,000 crore in August of which Rs 33,000 crore estimated to be secured debt.

Reliance Jio and UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited were the highest bidders for RCOM assets at the CoC meeting held on January 13, 2019. Jio had placed a bid of around Rs 4,700 crore for the tower and fiber assets of Reliance Infratel Ltd (RITL), while UVARCL has made an offer of Rs 14,000 crore for spectrum, real estate assets, enterprise, and data center businesses held by RCom and Reliance Telecom Ltd.

In addition, the creditors will clawback the priority payments of Rs 4,300 crore made to Chinese (Rs 1,300 crore) and Indian lenders (Rs 3,000 crore). “Loans of Chinese lenders will reduce by nearly 65 per cent to around Rs 4,000 crore from around Rs 12,000 crore. This is the highest-ever recovery of dues by financial creditors in the telecom sector, which has seen the exit or shut down of 11 out of 12 telcos since 2012,” the source claimed. According to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, the recovery to lenders in the case of Bhushan Steel and Essar Steel was 63 per cent and 60 per cent, respectively. “The bidders have committed to pay 30 per cent of the proceeds of around Rs 7,500 crore within 90 days,” the source said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/lenders-approve-rs-23k-crore-resolution-plan-for-rcom--major-share-for-chinese-banks.html
157,06-3-20,RBI to be ‘proactive’ in tackling virus threat: Das,"The Reserve Bank of India will be proactive in dealing with threats stemming from the coronavirus outbreak and will have assessed the potential impact on India by the next rate decision due April 3, Governor Shaktikanta Das told BloombergQuint.

“If required, the RBI will act as and when required and, as in the past, the RBI will be proactive and act in time,” Das said, when asked if the central bank needs to make an emergency move. His comments come just days after the US Federal Reserve cut rates by 50 basis points in a surprise decision, triggering speculation that other central banks will follow suit.

In a report, Deutsche Bank said it saw increased possibility of the RBI delivering an atleast 25 basis points rate cut before its April 3 decision.

159,06-3-20,EPFO cuts interest rate on deposits to 7-year low of 8.5%,"Retirement fund body EPFO on Thursday lowered interest rate on provident fund deposits to a seven-year low of 8.5 per cent for the current financial year.

The the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) had provided 8.65 per cent rate of interest on EPF for 2018-19 to its around six crore subscribers. The decision was taken at a meeting of the the EPFO’s apex decision making body — the Central Board of Trustee (CBT).

“The EPFO has decided to provide 8.5 per cent interest rate on EPF deposits for 2019-20 in the CBT meeting today,” Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar said here after the meeting.

The Minister also said that the EPFO will have a surplus of over Rs 700 crore on providing 8.5 per cent rate of interest on EPF for this fiscal.

A ministry source said, “The EPFO would have left with a surplus of over Rs 300 crore if it had provided 8.55 per cent rate of interest on EPF for this fiscal. There would have been a deficit if the EPFO had provided a rate of more than 8.55 per cent for current fiscal.”

The EPF interest rate announced for the current fiscal is lowest since 2012-13, when it was 8.5 per cent.The EPFO had provided 8.65 per cent interest rate to its subscribers for 2016-17 and 8.55 per cent in 2017-18. The rate of interest was slightly higher at 8.8 per cent in 2015-16.

It had given 8.75 per cent rate of interest in 2013-14 as well as 2014-15, higher than 8.5 per cent for 2012-13.

Now, the labour ministry requires the finance ministry’s concurrence on the matter. Since the Government of India is the guarantor, the finance ministry has to vet the proposal for EPF interest rate to avoid any liability on account of shortfall in the EPFO income for a fiscal.

The finance ministry has been nudging the labour ministry for aligning the EPF interest rate with other small saving schemes run by the government like the public provident fund and post office saving schemes.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/epfo-cuts-interest-rate-on-deposits-to-7-year-low-of-8-5--2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/epfo-cuts-interest-rate-on-deposits-to-7-year-low-of-8-5-.html

A unidentified spokesman for the department was quoted in a news release as saying. “There is currently no evidence that pet animals can be a source of infection of COVID-19 or that they become sick.” Scientists suspect the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 that causes the disease originated in bats before passing it on to another species, possibly a small wild mammal, that passed it on to humans.

165,06-3-20,Travel within,"With the outbreak of Covid-19 in the country, tourist bookings decline majorly but domestic options see an uptick. So tour operators are introducing discounted schemes and suggesting measures to ensure safety, says Chahak Mittal

Out there, a new deadly virus is ready to threaten our lives once again. This time, it’s very much alive in the air that we breathe. And there’s no way to find out if you have inhaled it already. It has the potential to wipe out millions of us and affect a country’s economy and various businesses. And the first industry to have been seriously hit is the travel & tourism sector. History is evidence of how epidemics have a direct and immediate impact on hotels, restaurants, airlines, and travel aggregators and agencies. The Covid-19 or the Coronavirus is badly affecting the travel economy with a global curfew and restrictive advisories. A China tour operator recently declared bankruptcy and Chinese tourist enterprises are shutting their services one after the other.

With the recent outbreak of the virus in the national capital, travel operators are complaining of a sharp decline in tourist bookings, especially to South Asian countries and parts of Europe. Tourists are cancelling their long-planned vacations, honeymoons and corporate trips. But there is a silver lining. Those who have cancelled their plans are shifting to domestic travel options. As per the Travel Agents Federation of India, with a number of cancellation of bookings, there has been a loss of `200-300 crore. One hopes that by travelling within, we can survive the aftershocks.

Number of bookings declines

Nishant Pitti, co-founder and CEO, EaseMyTrip, said, “There has been a huge drop in outbound travel, especially in the bookings for the Southeast Asian countries. We have witnessed a sudden hike in the number of cancellations since the outbreak. Travellers have become very cautious about their travel plans and they are either postponing their trips, changing their destinations or cutting trips short to return home sooner. Cancellations have risen up to 30 to 35 per cent.”

Specifying the destinations, MakeMyTrip spokesperson said, “Data on our platform indicates that flight bookings for Southeast Asian countries have been significantly impacted. Countries in the West, including the US and Europe are seeing a huge dip. However, we continue to extend complete support and comfort to our travellers amid the chaos. And together with airline partners, we have been proactively offering refunds to travellers in impacted areas.”

Spotlight on India

Even though international travel might have been adversely affected, travel experts claim that domestic travel in the country has seen a surge amid the outbreak. Nishant added, “There hasn’t been much drop in domestic travel, which is only 10 to 15 per cent.”

Anand Menon, brand leader, Travel Tours, Leisure Travel Brand of FCM Travel Solutions, said, “We have seen a 12 to 13 per cent dip in leisure and 10 to 11 per cent dip in corporate travellers from India to abroad, especially China. While the east-bound traffic has been adversely affected, domestic traffic has seen an uptick.” He added that apart from domestic destinations, there has also been a surge in Eastern European countries like Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia and Serbia.

Rajeev Kale, president and country head, Holiday, MICE, Visa, Thomas Cook (India) Ltd, agreed that with the international condition worsening, the spotlight has “clearly shifted” to India. He said, “We are now encouraging the uptake of over 15 per cent demand for domestic tourism. Destinations that have witnessed high demand for summer 2020 include Andamans, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir, Kerala and the North East.”

Opting of domestic destinations is also coupled with the growing trend of Indian travellers choosing multiple micro-cations or bite-sized breaks against merely one long annual vacation, points out an expert.

Ensuring safer travel

Cancelling a trip or taking a short haul are certainly the safest options in such a crisis. However, what are travel operators doing to ensure safer travel options for travellers? As a safety measure, experts suggest that travellers should avoid visiting affected areas and follow all guidelines prescribed by the Health Ministry.

Daniel D’souza, president and country head, Leisure, SOTC Travel, said, “We have instituted a safety protocol for our tour managers, coaches and on-ground operations relating to travel from affected areas. We have also rolled out the ‘SOTC Ultra Flexi Scheme’ for new customers. Under the scheme, travellers can be reassured on flexibility on departure dates; only actual visa charges will be charged in case of cancellations which are due to the virus; cover under our DIGIT Insurance will be provided for the full sum insured for Europe, USA, Africa and Australia and New Zealand.”

Experts suggest basic tips like washing hands regularly with soap or an alcohol-based solution, coughing or sneezing into a disposable tissue, watching for symptoms such as of respiratory infections, wearing a mask at crowded places. Rajeev (TCI) said, “Our tour managers are being equipped with emergency contact numbers on-ground at each destination and are co-ordinating with our local destination partners and suppliers to ensure every care and precaution is taken towards the safety of customers.”

Varesh Chopra, regional director, South Asia and the Middle East for the Globus family of brands, Cosmos Vacations, said, “As an added precaution, we are restricting anyone who has travelled from/visited or transited through China, Macau, or Hong Kong, within the 21 days prior to the start of their vacation. If anyone has recently travelled overseas, we recommend that travellers check the current travel policy of their final destinations, which has changed or regulated by many governments.”

For TIRUN (The Indian Representative of Royal Caribbean Cruises), regardless of nationality, boarding is being denied to anyone who has travelled from, to, or through mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Italy, Iran, or South Korea, 15 days prior to embarkation. Varun Chadha, CEO, added, “Our policy also denies any person who has had contact with, or helped care for, anyone suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19, or who are currently subject to health monitoring for possible exposure to virus.”

The cruise company is also making sure that the ships and the terminals are sanitised before and after every sailing. Varun said, “There is also special sanitising of high traffic areas onboard multiple times a day. We’ve added medical staff too.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/travel-within-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/travel-within.html

167,06-3-20,Moratorium on Yes Bank credit negative: Moody's,"The Reserve Bank on India's moratorium and withdrawal cap on Yes Bank is credit negative, and the lack of coordinated action action highlights continued uncertainty around bank resolutions, Moody's Investors Service said on Friday.

The central bank on Thursday imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account and superseded the board of the private sector lender with immediate effect.

“RBI's moratorium on Yes Bank is credit negative as it affects timely repayment of bank depositors and creditors,” Moody's Investors Service Vice President – Senior Credit Officer, Financial Institutions, Alka Anbarasu said.

Yes Bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

For the next month, Yes Bank will be led by the RBI-appointed administrator Prashant Kumar, an ex-chief financial officer of State Bank of India (SBI).

Moody's said it expects Indian authorities will take steps to prevent the weakness in the bank's viability from significantly impacting its depositors and senior creditors.

“The lack of a coordinated and timely action highlights continued uncertainty around bank resolutions in India,” Anbarasu added.

The board of SBI on Thursday gave an ""in-principle"" approval to invest in the capital-starved Yes Bank, which has been struggling to execute a capital raising plan for the last six months.

Its core equity tier-I ratio had slipped to 8.7 per cent as of September.

The bank had also delayed its December quarter results.

The last lender to be placed under a similar action was PMC Bank in September last year. While the withdrawal limits have been increased over time to Rs 1 lakh now, many PMC Bank depositors are still in the lurch.

The BSE bankex was trading lower by nearly 3 per cent.

The broader market was also hit hard, with the BSE benchmark tanking 1,459.52 points.

In a rare move, capital-starved Yes Bank was placed under a moratorium, with the RBI capping deposit withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account for a month and superseding its board.

The announcement came late Thursday evening.

Yes Bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

170,06-3-20,"Trump cheers Bloomberg implosion, but Biden worries linger","While Super Tuesday left the Democrats with a pair of front-runners President Donald Trump believes he can define and defeat, there are still some private worries in the White House.

There is concern that the Democrats’ messy nomination contest may end up producing an emboldened version of the very man who once worried Trump so much as a foe that it led to the president’s impeachment. That would be Joe Biden.

Still, there was plenty for Trump to like in Tuesday’s 14-state round of voting that transformed the Democratic race into a delegate shootout between an avowed proponent of democratic socialism (Bernie Sanders) and a longtime Washington insider (Biden). It banished from the race former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, whose endless millions had gotten under the president’s skin, and it pushed aside Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who could have proved to be a formidable rhetorical challenger against Trump.

That sets up Trump to run for reelection on familiar territory and allows him to revive some of the same lines of attack that proved successful in 2016.

The public reaction from Trump and his campaign on Wednesday was gleeful as Biden’s remarkable campaign comeback reset the Democratic nomination fight into a two-candidate contest with Sanders.

Those around the president have long asserted that Sanders, with his unapologetic support for “Medicare for All,” free college and other wish list items, is too liberal for most of the nation. They also believe Biden has lost a step and is saddled with a decadeslong Washington record and questions surrounding the conduct of his son Hunter.

“Truly is a ‘heads we win, tails they lose’ situation,” said Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh.

But there are some caveats in the campaign’s confidence.

Trump and his team have spent the last year trying to lump the Democratic contenders together as left-wing radicals. Biden’s working-class appeal and more pragmatic policy approach aren’t a ready fit with that GOP framing. Trump allies have pointed to Biden’s embrace of liberal positions on gun control, but he steered clear of the more extreme positions of his rivals on health care.

Watching the results Tuesday night from the White House residence, Trump cheered the collapse of Bloomberg, who sank more than $500 million of his own money into his campaign yet performed woefully the first day his name appeared on the ballot.

The president unleashed a series of tweets the next morning that belittled the Democratic field — including Warren, who was assessing whether to move forward — and he was so eager to talk about the race that he invited reporters to ask him about it during a White House meeting with airline executives.

“No questions about the election?” Trump asked before registering several hot takes that would not be out of place on the morning cable news shows he frequently watches.

Before Bloomberg dropped out Wednesday morning, Trump goaded the billionaire, who has promised to continue his free-spending anti-Trump effort on behalf of the eventual Democratic nominee. “You can’t buy an election,” Trump said. “It’s a beautiful thing.”

Trump took particular delight in Bloomberg’s implosion, having long resented the former mayor’s significantly greater wealth and ease in moving around Manhattan’s elite social circles. He told confidants that Bloomberg’s political downfall, beginning with a widely panned debate performance last month, should forever silence those in the media who claimed that he was jealous of Bloomberg or that the “wrong” New York billionaire was sitting in the Oval Office, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorised to discuss private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-cheers-bloomberg-implosion--but-biden-worries-linger.html
171,06-3-20,How winning turned Biden into confident candidate,"Joe Biden strode confidently to the podium, shutters clicking, a bank of cameras beaming to a national audience. “Those of you who have been knocked down, those of you who have been knocked out, this is your campaign,” Biden said Wednesday. “We welcome all of those who want to join us. We’re building a movement.”

The former vice president has found his stride and his voice as he becomes a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Gone is the sometimes mumbling, almost wistful 77-year-old, standing before small Iowa crowds full of voters lamenting the state of the union. “What in God’s

name is happening?” he’d ask, after deviating from anything approaching prepared remarks.

Instead, there’s a confident candidate, jabbing at Bernie Sanders, his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, yet reserving his biggest swings for the Republican president he hopes to topple in the fall. “If we give this man another four years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally change the character of this nation,” Biden said Wednesday.

But Biden also tries to seem above the trenches, promising to unify a fractious Democratic Party and a general electorate roiled by Donald Trump’s presidency.

It’s part scrappy Joey Biden, the kid from Scranton, Pennsylvania, who learned to navigate a severe stutter but still talks of the searing humiliation. It’s part Delaware senator, the deal-maker promising to replace Washington churlishness with comity, dignity and diplomacy. It’s part two-term vice president, the national officeholder who believes “with every fiber of my being” that he can return in the top spot this time and “heal the nation.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/how-winning-turned-biden-into-confident-candidate.html

174,06-3-20,The great addition,"Actor Ali Fazal has shot for his second major Hollywood film, Death on the Nile. He says he has come back with a great addition to his understanding of an actor’s job.

The Victoria & Abdul actor had shot for three months for Death on the Nile, directed by Kenneth Branagh.

Talking about his experience, Ali said: “Honestly, it’s a nascent part of my career in the West so I’m only learning with each passing day and project. And being on sets of Death on the Nile too was a progressive growing experience for me.”

He feels that when you shoot with people who are masters of their craft, you will land up learning a lot of things.

“I’m humbled by the experience and the time I spent on the sets. I have come back with a great addition to my understanding of an actor’s job, as it’s a part of our lives to keep learning with each part that comes our way,” said Ali.

“In this day and age, actors are no longer transitioning but merely expanding their skill sets. I aspire to work in different countries, platforms, regardless of their languages. I have found people who push me to seek parts and not projects and that’s my blueprint going forward,” he added.

The film also stars Wonder Woman actor Gal Gadot, Emma Mackey, Armie Hammer and Annette Bening amongst others.

“They were all extremely kind, professional and warm. The entire bunch is a wonderful group of people who bring a certain energy every time they walk onto the sets. So I hope I managed to learn from them and I hope I have brought my best to the table. We were a diverse bunch who were bringing some very valuable contributions that it almost felt like the Olympics. It was the amalgamation of these unique energies that made it so interesting,” said the actor.

He has another international project in his kitty though he is tight-lipped about it.

Ali had made his Bollywood debut with a special appearance in the 2009 blockbuster 3 Idiots.

He then starred in Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011) and went on to achieve success with films, including Fukrey.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-great-addition-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-great-addition.html
175,06-3-20,Harman & girls have firepower to win T20 WC,"Former captain Jhulan Goswami has put her money firmly behind the Indian team, saying that the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side has the arsenal to win their maiden Women’s T20 World Cup title. India qualified for the final as their semi-final clash against England got washed out at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday.

“It is great news. They have dominated the World Cup. They topped the group and made it to the semis. The semi-final was washed out but this is part of the game,” Jhulan told IANS. But in Heather Knight's England, India had the toughest challenge as they have never beaten them in the competition. However, Goswami said now that they are in the final, their real task would be to not get bogged down by the pressure of the big stage and keep playing fearless cricket.

“Pressure will be there. World Cup final is the biggest stage. Handling the pressure is the key. They have played fearless cricket so far and I am hopeful they will continue playing good cricket and will win the World Cup,” said Goswami who was part of India’s gut-wrenching 2017 50-over World Cup final loss to England at Lord’s.

The 35-year-old added that reaching the final is an achievement in itself and the fearless brand of cricket the team has played can help them win the trophy.

“Reaching the final and in this fashion is a big achievement. They should continue playing the fearless cricket they have been playing,” said Goswami who is the only player in the world to take more than 200 wickets in women's one-day internationals.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/harman---girls-have-firepower-to-win-t20-wc.html

“They wanted to see today’s game, but unfortunately, they didn’t get to watch.

“It means a lot because from day one I wanted them to watch me playing cricket and today I got this opportunity. They have come here to watch all of us playing, and I hope we get all support from all the parents and try to win this tournament.”

Her parents will remain in Australia to watch India play in the final at the iconic MCG, which will take place on her 31st birthday.

Harmanpreet said the team knew the importance of winning all matches from the beginning.

177,06-3-20,"Lanning, Schutt lead Southern Stars win","Four-time champions Australia used their rich big-match experience to surpass a spirited South Africa by five runs in a rain-hit semifinal here on Thursday, setting up a title clash against first-timers India.

There were fears that the second semifinal between Australia and South Africa at the SCG too will be washed out like the India and England match earlier in the day. But the weather improved just enough to get a game albeit a curtailed one.

Australia skipper Meg Lanning led from the front with unbeaten 49 off as many balls to take her team to 134 for five in 20 overs. Rain returned during the innings break and South Africa were set a revised target of 98 runs in 13 overs as per the D/L method.

South Africa ended at 92 for five despite a fighting 41 not out off 27 balls from Laura Wolvaardt, leaving them dejected.

Hosts Australia, who did not have the services of injured star all-rounder Elysse Perry, were ecstatic after Jess Jonassen was able to defend 19 runs in the final over with South Africa getting only 13.

With the win, Australia advanced to their sixth successive final out of the seven editions held so far.

“It was extremely tense. Even in the last couple of balls it just wasn’t safe. They needed 19 off the last over and we knew we had to nail it. But that’s T20 cricket for you; I was extremely nervous,” said skipper Lanning.

On the final against India, she added: “India are a class side, they have been playing excellent cricket. We are going to have to play really well. We have been improving each day, it hasn't been an easy road.

“We wanted to give ourselves a chance of playing in the finals, and now we just need to enjoy ourselves. We are travelling to Melbourne tomorrow, train on Saturday and play on Sunday. I doubt there’d be much sleep happening tonight.”

South Africa skipper Dane van Niekerk said her team tried its best.

“...We have to give credit to Australia for the way they bowled and we just came six short. We brought them back with the ball really well, they got off to a flier and we thought they’d get to 160.

“All the bowlers did really well, and credit to them for how they brought it back. It was very emotional to see the ladies like that.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/lanning--schutt-lead-southern-stars-win.html
178,06-3-20,Unhappy Knight calls for rule change,"England captain Heather Knight on Thursday called for a rule change after a rained-out semifinal clash against India knocked them out of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup here.

ICC regulations dictate that in the event of a semi-final washout, the winners of each group automatically go through to the final in Melbourne on Sunday. The world body had earlier declined Cricket Australia’s request for a reserve day.

“They’re the rules that everyone signed up to,” Knight said of the absence of a reserve day.

“You’d hope now that there has been this situation and the game tonight is potentially going to be rained off as well, so you’d hope now there is going to be a rule change and moving forward, no other team will have to experience going out of a World Cup purely because of rain,” she said after the abandonment of the game.

“Hopefully it changes,” she added.

“It’s gutting. You put in a lot of hard work. There’s not a lot we can do about it..We’re just going to have to rue that first game and try to move on but it’s going to be a bitter pill to swallow for a few of us now.”

179,06-3-20,Rain takes India to final,"An unbeaten run in the group stage propelled India into their maiden Women’s T20 World Cup final against defending champions Australia after their last-four clash against England was washed out here on Thursday, prompting both captains to say that reserve days are essential for knockout clashes.

Persistent rain since morning delayed the toss and eventually the semifinal was called off without a ball being bowled, taking Indians into the summit clash and leaving England players in tears.

""Really frustrating. Not how we wanted the World Cup to finish for us. No reserve day, no chance of getting play, and ultimately that loss against South Africa cost us,” a dejected England captain Heather Knight said after the game was abandoned.

Her India counterpart Harmanpreet Kaur also agreed that the semifinals should have had a reserve day, a request which was made by host Cricket Australia but turned down by the ICC.

“Unfortunate we didn’t get a game, but there are rules and we have to follow it. Having reserve days in the future will be a great idea,” said Kaur.

Knight said her team paid the price for not starting the tournament well.

“It's all very English isn’t it, talking about the weather and getting knocked out. It felt that we gained a bit of momentum in the last few games and we were pumped up for the semifinals,” she added.

“Lessons are to win the first game I guess (laughs). It's become a trend, not to start well in tournaments, and that has cost us.”

India had topped Group A with four victories in as many matches while England had finished second in Group B with three wins and a defeat.

“From day one, we new we have to win all the games because in case the semis don’t happen, that would be hard for us. In that sense, credit to the team for winning all the games,” said Kaur.

“Everybody is looking in great touch - Shafali (Verma) and Smriti (Mandhana). They are giving us good starts, and that helps. Me and Smriti are trying to spend more time in the nets,” she added reflecting on her and Mandhana's so far indifferent form.

“We are looking more positive now. Unfortunately we haven't come up with big innings, but our teammates are, and at the end of the day it’s a team game.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rain-takes-india-to-final.html
180,06-3-20,‘Underdogs’ India look to upset Croatia,"In a bold decision, underdogs India on Thursday preferred Ramkumar Ramanathan over number one singles player Sumit Nagal for their clash against top seeds Croatia in the Davis Cup Qualifiers beginning here today.

The hosts will be led by world number 37 Marin Cilic and the 2014 US Open champion is the only top-50 singles player in their ranks.

The absence of their best-ranked player Borna Coric (33rd) means that Indians can go after their second singles player Borna Gojo, who is yet to win a match in the Davis Cup.

Getting two points from Gojo is very much possible for the visitors, considering that he is placed 277th in the ATP rankings, which is below all three Indian singles players.

Nagal (127) is India’s best-ranked player and he along with Ramumar Ramanathan (182), and Prajnesh (132) is capable of beating Gojo though they have not competed against him yet.

Non-playing captain Rohit Rajpal, while explaining the surprise decision, said that conditions demanded that Ramkumar should play instead of Nagal.

“The courts are medium-paced with low bounce. It is suiting Ramkumar more because Sumit is not getting the bite with his top-spin from back of the court,” Rajpal said.

“It is important to get one point on the opening day, so we made Prajnesh our number one player instead of Sumit. It’s a strategy made in the best interest of the team and the nation,” he elaborated.

Rajpal also said that it was a team decision and the coach Zeeshan Ali, all seniors players were discussed.

Prajnesh, who missed the last tie because of his marriage, admitted that the lack of a strong second singles player in the rival line-up could work to India’s advantage.

Ramkumar will play second singles against Cilic.

Leander Paes and Rohan Bopanna will play the doubles rubber against Mate Pavic and Franko Skugor.

The doubles will be a crucial match in the tie, the winner of which will qualify for the year-end Davis Cup Finals, to be held in November in Madrid.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---underdogs----india-look-to-upset-croatia.html

182,06-3-20,Twist in the tale,"Locura is the place to head to if you are looking for a little extra in every dish that you order, says Ayushi Sharma

The sky was grey. As I looked up, the first drops came steady and soft on my face. The light ‘pitter patter’ of the rain suddenly turned into wet thuds as we walked towards Locura, an all-day bar and lounge in South Extension. We wondered if there would be window panes through which we could hear the gentle tapping of raindrops falling against the glass. Entering the place reminded me of a childhood game where we could jump and dance on the alternating black and white stripes on the ground. Walking past a floor piano, I instantly recalled the film BIG, where Tom Hanks and Robert Loggia play on a giant floor piano at FAO Schwarz. So we bounced and skipped to make our way to the table, which was exactly where we wanted it to be (right next to a large French window).

It was time for what we came for. Executive chef Sajal Mazumdar curated the menu, especially for us. He told us that the menu ranges from innovations of modern Indian, playful twists of the Continental to tasteful European, Oriental and Italian cuisine. The very first dish that he brought to the table was the Laping, a cold and spicy Tibetan preparation with a twist — being the dry ice — that he poured on the dish. Served with a chilli soy sauce gravy, Laping was like a small wrap with a filling of mung bean enriched with a variety of ingredients such as coriander, garlic, green onion sauce and red chilli peppers inside. It was jelly-like and slippery while at the same time, tender. Adding the chilli sauce on the top further enhanced its taste and the dry ice made it look appetising. We somehow had the feeling that this would stand out from the remaining meal that was yet to be served.

Next up was vegetarian crystal dimsums, filled with crushed broccoli and corns. They were delightfully chewy and delicate in flavour. Chef Sajal shared that it’s the addition of starch that makes the translucence of crystal dumplings possible. Plus, the starch also gives the dumpling wrappers that pleasant chewy texture which is a hallmark of a well-made one. After having two dimsums each, our tastebuds were still stuck on the flavours of Laping. We craved for more.

Moving on, we had spring rolls, which were brought in four tiny shot-glasses, one-third of which were dipped in a sweet but mildly chilly sauce. Prepared with fresh vegetables and spicy condiments, they were slightly sour, which made our rising taste graph decline a bit. And when asked chef Sajal, he told us it was because of lemon cough drops. However, undoubtedly, they were the crispiest ones we have ever had.

Chef Sajal fussed over us like a mother worried about feeding her children. It certainly gained the place a few extra points. Next, he brought their special — Locura cheese salad, which had fresh Tomini cheese, crispy lettuce with mustard and cocktail mayo — all produced in-house. Salad isn’t just a summer affair. When the weather turns a little cooler, these need a lot more oomph and weight. This one did just that. For starters, not every cheese is right for a salad. A smooth, creamy Brie is just too soft and buttery. You want something with substance that you can crumble, shred or cube and which will lend interesting, contrasting texture to the greens. The cheese that chef Sajal used was perfect. The two of us reached a similar conclusion that we had never tried such a fresh and healthy recipe. Each ingredient in the salad made sure to make its own place. To accompany the healthy snack, we ordered Pina Colada, a sweet cocktail made with rum, blended with cream of coconut or coconut milk and pineapple juice. It tasted just right.

Moving further, the most creative one, presentation-wise, he presented the Naga skull filled with cottage cheese. It was a replacement of a non-vegetarian dish — Naga skull lamb served with fries. Bread was shaped like a skull and stuffed with a blend of vegetables, mashed cottage cheese, all tossed up in butter and spices for a rounded experience. The dish was a completely novel way of presenting a pav bhaji. We both took our first bites and instantly changed our mind that placed Laping as the centerpiece of the menu. This was the most tempting and delectable delicacy in the whole menu.

As I neared a saturation, the last dish in line, a dessert actually, was the Crostata Di Cioccolata. The speed of the service was uniform but we told them to bring our dessert a bit late. After all the food that we had, it would take time for us to to let the food settle down a bit. The dessert was totally worth the wait. It was made with gooey Italian chocolate tart, vanilla crumble and dark chocolate. The night ended on a good note with the raindrops still pouring down the window pane, the only difference being our stomachs were full and hearts were content.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/twist-in-the-tale-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/twist-in-the-tale.html
183,06-3-20,A notch higher,"If you are looking for comfort food albeit with enhanced taste, The Irish House is the place to head to. By Sakshi Sharma

There was something unusual on the top floor of the DLF Mall of India, Noida. The heart of the disturbance lay in the food court where we could spot a scattered crowd and perturbed chefs from a distance, all of whom were focussed on the floor. We stepped closer to get a better view and noticed that they were busy trying to usher out a pigeon which was unable to find its way out of the confines of the place. We laughed and quickly moved towards the Irish House, which was too self-absorbed to be aware of what was happening outside.

Stepping inside, we took in the brick walls with beautiful photo frames, coloured glass windows and giant-size beer-shaped bottles on a steel panel — the setup gave a carefree Saturday night vibe on a Tuesday.

We first ordered Meat fest pizza. Its thin and crispy crust was topped with chorizo, cheese stuffed chicken sausages, chicken meatballs and grilled onions. The balance between the crispy crust and soft meatballs was truly satisfying. A pizza lover who digs meat would dig this one.

Next in line was the Holy veg macaroni dipped in the chef’s special cheddar cheese sauce — creamy and peppery. We then ordered Herbivore’s chargrilled and Carnivore’s grilled platter. The former had an array of spiced chargrilled carrots, baby corns, bell peppers, broccoli and zucchini. Served with a mango jalapeno dip and smoked BBQ, the platter looked vibrant and was a treat not only for the eyes but the gastronomic senses too. The latter had grilled chimichurri sauce and jerk chicken, Turkish lamb pops, smoked BBQ chicken wings and roasted potato wedges. We had thought that the platter was a good idea to taste a little bit of everything but soon realised that it left no space for other dishes.

Shrimpy chilli garlic with grilled baby potatoes and scallions with a peri-peri and pommery mustard glaze was up next. The shrimps looked like the peels of a newly-sharpened pencil and were crispy. The dish raised our expectations for the forthcoming dishes.

Then it was the turn of Chicken dinner, the name giving us the feel of a proper meal. My friend jumped up reading its name as it resembled the victory slogan of the famous PUBG game — ‘Winner winner, chicken dinner.’ I wondered if he had ordered the dish solely for this reason. It had crumb-fried chicken stuffed with chicken ham, mozzarella, parmesan and cheddar cheese, which certainly fulfilled our expectations, which had climbed a notch after the last dish. The creamy mushroom sauce and garlic fries added to the taste.

We then moved towards our favourite part of a meal, the dessert. Being waffle lovers, we ordered Drunken waffle wich without giving it much thought. Fresh waffles packed with bourbon cream and a warm chocolate sauce appeared before us and the presentation, was impressive for sure. We jumped to take the first bite... and realised that this was not how we wanted to end our night. The waffle which appeared fresh and was expected to be crispy was soggy and tasted stale. So we decided to ask for a Vintage tiramisu. The subtly sweet classic Italian favourite — ladyfingers dipped in coffee, layered with luscious mascarpone cheese and topped with sabayon sauce and cocoa was certainly an improvement over the previous one. To make sure that our night ended with the best, the chef prepared a Dual chocolate cake for us. We realised that the dark and white chocolate mousse cake with a chocolate sauce drizzle was certainly everything that our hearts desired from the start.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-notch-higher-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-notch-higher-a-notch-higher.html

185,06-3-20,Janneman maiden ton helps SA seal series,"Janneman Malan, snubbed for South Africa’s upcoming tour of India, hit a match-winning century as the Proteas clinched their one-day international series against Australia with a six-wicket victory in the second match at the Mangaung Oval on Wednesday.

Malan made 129 not out to enable South Africa to chase down a target of 272 and seal the series with a game to spare their first win in five series in all formats in home internationals this season.

Malan, 23, was out for a first-ball duck on his ODI debut in the first match in Paarl on Saturday and was not selected in a 15-man squad which will depart on Sunday for a three-game tour of India.

“They were great partners to have in the chase,” said Malan. “My partners kept me calm when I was itching a bit.”

He made his runs off 139 balls and hit seven fours and four sixes.

Malan had to share the man-of-the-match award with fast bowler Lungi Ngidi, who took six for 58.

Finch said his team had finished 20 or 30 runs short because of their costly late-innings collapse.

“When you’ve got ‘in’ batters batting right to the end it makes a huge difference,” he said.

Ngidi said: “I was given the challenge before the game by the coach (Mark Boucher) to knock over the big three.”

Finch and Warner posted 50 off the first 37 balls of the innings before Ngidi had Warner caught at cover. He followed up by dismissing Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne off successive balls.

Labuschagne’s wicket was Ngidi’s 50th in his 26th ODI — the fastest South African to the landmark.

D’Arcy Short, who gained a place on the tour when Glenn Maxwell was ruled out because of surgery, made 69, his maiden one-day international half-century, before he was out in the 42nd over to start Australia’s slide.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/janneman-maiden-ton-helps-sa-seal-series.html
186,06-3-20,Kohli just out of form:Sehwag,"Former Indian opener Virender Sehwag believes Virat Kohli, who struggled in New Zealand across formats, is just suffering from lack of form and “doesn’t have hand-eye coordination issues”.

“When you are out of form, nothing works for you. It is not that Virat is not making efforts but luck has deserted him,” Sehwag was quoted as saying by Sportstar.

“Virat certainly doesn't have hand-eye coordination issues. Your hand-eye issue deteriorates over a period of time. Not overnight. I am sure it is just lack of form. Also, he has got out to good deliveries.”

In the two Test matches against Kane Williamson’s men, Kohli managed just 38 runs at an average of 9.50 — his worst in recent times. He amassed a total of 218 runs in the 11 innings (four T20Is, three ODIs and four Tests) that he played against the Black Caps and ended a pathetic tour with just 14 in his last innings.

The end result was that the number one Test side had to face a crushing defeat at the hands of Black Caps, who made amends following their 5-0 whitewash in the T20Is and came back strongly to win the ODIs and the Test matches — 3-0 and 2-0, respectively.

“Here (in New Zealand) the ball has seamed a lot and if you are not getting runs then the challenge multiplies. Of course, you can adapt, playing more on the front foot, by leaving the ball,” said Sehwag.

“For me, it is important to know which ball to leave and you can do that when you are feeling confident. The pressure also may have got to Virat,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kohli-just-out-of-form-sehwag.html
187,06-3-20,Mashrafe steps down as B'desh ODI captain,"Bangladesh pace bowler Mashrafe Mortaza, one of the country’s biggest sports stars, stepped down on Thursday as captain of the national one-day side, possibly ending his international career.

Friday’s 50-over game against Zimbabwe in Sylhet will be his last as captain, said the 36-year-old, who already has a new career as a member of parliament. Mashrafe said he would remain available for selection as a player, but selectors are under pressure to bring in fresh blood ahead of the 2023 World Cup in India.

“I would like to thank Bangladesh Cricket Board for keeping confidence in me for such a long period,” said Mashrafe.

“I will try to give my best as a player if I get the opportunity.”

Mashrafe, who withdrew from a lucrative national team contract in January, said the decision to rebuild the team for the next World Cup had convinced him to step down.

“Until yesterday I was undecided, but this morning I thought ‘that’s enough’” he said.

Mashrafe, who has had seven operations on his knees, acknowledged that he had been lucky to play so long.

The bowler has cult status in Bangladesh for his role in taking the team from being international whipping boys to becoming a respected limited-overs side.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mashrafe-steps-down-as-b-desh-odi-captain.html
188,06-3-20,"Rahul & Pant doing well, but Dhoni is missed: Kuldeep","India spinner Kuldeep Yadav has once again highlighted the position former skipper MS Dhoni has in the Indian set-up. The bowler has said that while KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant have been performing well behind the stumps, the experience that Dhoni brings is being missed in the team.

“Mahi bhai obviously brings a lot of experience with him and he has given the Indian team a lot. So when a player like that is not playing of course you miss him. They (Rahul and Pant) are young and are doing well. Both are keeping well so it has not made too much of a difference, but yes, you do miss his presence,” Kuldeep told reporters on Thursday.

While Pant was pushed as Dhoni’s replacement post the 2019 World Cup, the 22-year-old’s inconsistency with the bat led to Rahul taking his place behind the stumps. Consequently, Rahul’s supreme form with the bat and ability to play in a variety of positions across the order seems to have led to him making the position his own.

“They are catching well and batting pretty well. I have not felt too much of a difference in that way. Every player has their good days and bad days and it’s important to back them when they have bad ones. It’s not that you play for one day, there are lots of days in a year for cricket,” he said.

Kuldeep felt that from a bowler’s point of view, adjusting to Rahul or Pant from Dhoni has not been too much of a leap.

Kuldeep and Yuzvendra Chahal’s rise as a deadly wrist spin duo was a theme for India going into the 2019 World Cup. Since then however, the return of Ravindra Jadeja to the limited-overs setup has led to the pair rarely getting to play together in a match. Kuldeep said that it’s all down to the team management when asked if he expects to play once again with Chahal at the T20 World Cup later in the year.

“Our team is very strong and we will make as much effort as possible to put up a strong performance. As far as wrist spin goes, it depends upon what the management decides. If there are two players who are very good at forming batting or bowling partnerships, it is always great for the team. So it will be good if we play together,” he said.

“It’s all on the team combination. Jadeja has been playing very well as a batsman, bowler and fielder. Because of him the combination has become stronger. He gives a lot of depth to the batting. Whenever Chahal and I get chances we try to perform to our best.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rahul---pant-doing-well--but-dhoni-is-missed--kuldeep.html
189,06-3-20,‘Reds bearing fruit of Klopp’s work’,"Liverpool FC legends Emile Heskey and Jason McAteer, who are in the city for Liverpool FC World Show that will take place at Select City Walk, Saket on Saturday (March 7) said on Thursday that current European Champions recent success in England and Europe is the result of manager Jurgen Klopp’s work that he has done in the past four years since he was appointed to take charge at Anfield.

“Klopp is one of the best managers in the world and has transformed this Liverpool side. His recruitment has been fantastic and he has built a squad that can cope up with the demands of club competitions and the Premier League.”

“He is a fantastic manager who has improved every player and now we are just bearing the fruits of what the last four years he has done for us,” said Jason McAteer, who represented Reds from 1995 to 1999.

Jurgen Klopp’s side is currently at the top of Premier League table, 22 points ahead of two-time defending champions Manchester City and is set to end the club’s 30 year wait for first Premier League title.

The Merseyside club just needs four more wins to secure the title that has eluded them for three decades.

Even though Liverpool has ‘almost secured’ the English title, their recent form is bit patchy, where the club has lost three of the last four games played and face a must-win tie at Anfield on March 11 against Atletico Madrid in Champions League round of 16.

But Heskey isn’t too much concerned about the results and said, “Generally they bounce back very well, so I can see them doing that again. Liverpool’s recent form is not a problem at all.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---reds-bearing-fruit-of-klopp---s-work---.html

The tiny, land-locked country, famous for measuring Gross National Happiness has emerged as a popular tourist destination in recent years.

But the government immediately shut borders to foreign visitors for two weeks in an effort to limit the impact of a disease that has wreaked havoc in more developed countries around the world.

The 76-year-old man arrived in Bhutan from India on March 2, and was admitted to hospital on March 5 with a fever, where he tested positive for COVID-19, the office of Prime Minister Lotay Tshering said in a Facebook post.

The post added that there would be ""two weeks' restriction on all incoming tourists with immediate effect"".

Schools in three areas -- including the capital Thimphu -- will be closed for two weeks from Friday.

The patient, who has not been named, left Washington on February 10, touring India from February 21 to March 1.

Health officials say they have traced roughly 90 people he came into contact with in Bhutan, with his 59-year-old partner, driver and guide all being placed in quarantine. None is currently showing symptoms.

The deadly virus that originated from China has spread to nearly 80 countries and has taken the lives of more than 3,300 people.

“We will be able to respond to the challenges emerging out of the coronavirus epidemic,” Das said at an industry event here.

While noting that there are enough resources to fight the crisis, given the robust forex reserves, he also called for the IMF to launch a non-stigmatised currency swap lines to ease the liquidity pressures globally.

“RBI stands ready to intervene in whatever way required to respond to epidemic challenges,” Das said, as he expects global growth to slow down due to coronavirus.

He also said that all central banks are resolved to work in close coordination.

On the domestic sector, he said certain sectors which depend on China will be impacted due to the epidemic, but mitigatory steps are being taken for it.

The impact on India will be limited as our economy is not much integrated with the global value chain; and to that extent we will be insulated, said Das.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rbi-ready-to-intervene-in-whatever-way-required-to-respond-to-coronavirus-challenges--governor-das-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/rbi-ready-to-intervene-in-whatever-way-required-to-respond-to-coronavirus-challenges--governor-das.html

“The resolution (to Yes Bank) will be done very swiftly, it will be done very fast. 30 days which we have given is the outer limit. You will see a very swift action from RBI,” Das told reportters here.

The decision on Yes Bank was taken at a larger level, not only to deal with the problem in an individual entity, but also to maintain stability and resilience of the Indian financial and banking sector, he said.

“Let me assure you that our banking sector continues to be sound and safe,"" Das said, adding that RBI was ready to effectively deal with the challenge ahead.

""We stand committed to maintaining stability of financial and banking sector,” he said.

On the timing of the action on Yes Bank, he said there is always debate over RBI acting prematurely or taking too long to act.

“A market-led and bank-led resolution of the problem is always preferable. You have to give time to the bank management to take step and efforts. And the bank did take efforts. When we found that we cannot wait and should not wait any longer, we decided to intervene.

“I think the timing is appropriate. I can assure you that RBI will come out with a scheme very shortly,” Das said.

Yes Bank was on Thursday placed under a moratorium, with the RBI capping deposit withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account for a month and superseding its board.

The bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

197,06-3-20,Shooters well prepared for Olympics: Bindra,"22008 Beijing Olympics Gold medallist Abhinav Bindra is hopeful that even though there are few youngsters in the Indian shooting contingent for 2020 Tokyo games, their age and inexperience won’t come in between them going for glory in the world’s biggest sporting event that is scheduled to take place in Japanese capital from July 24 to August 9.

Referring to the likes of Saurabh Chaudhary and Manu Bhaker, who are still in their teenage but have made enough name for themselves in the shooting world after stellar performance in Commonwealth, Asian Games and Youth Olympics along with ISSF World Cup events, India’s only Gold medallist in Olympics said, “They all have a lot of exposure, so they are well prepared. A lot of these young athletes have gone through youth Olympic games, so they know what it is like to be associated with a multidiscipline game.”

Speaking about India’s chances in the upcoming games, he said, “On paper, we can go past the six medals won in London.

198,06-3-20,Mbappe takes PSG into French Cup final,"Kylian Mbappe hit a hat-trick as Paris Saint-Germain cruised into the final of the French Cup with a thumping 5-1 win at Lyon on Wednesday.

The World Cup winner took his goal tally in all competitions to 30 during a win that was eased by Fernando Marcal being sent off just before Neymar put the French champions ahead in the 64th minute from the penalty spot.

The defeat Lyon ends a five-match unbeaten run that included an impressive 1-0 win over Juventus in the Champions League and the weekend’s triumph over local rivals Saint-Etienne.

“It was a solid, serious display full of concentration,” said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel.

“After the Dortmund match (lost 2-1 in Germany), Mbappe has responded brilliantly. He uses his speed so intelligently ... he is in good form.”

Mbappe equalised for the away side with a simple tap-in just three minutes after Martin Terrier had given the raucous home fans hope with a neat 11th-minute opener.

The 21-year-old was also key to PSG taking the lead in the 64th minute from the penalty spot.

Collecting the ball out on the left wing, he casually saw off two Lyon defenders before floating over a cross to fellow forward Edinson Cavani, who controlled the ball only for Marcal to then handle before the Uruguay striker could let his shot go.

Neymar slotted home the subsequent spot-kick after confirmation of the handball by VAR, while Marcal had to leave the field after being handed his second red card.

“I prefer to say nothing about the penalty,” said Lyon boss Rudi Garcia, who side face PSG in the League Cup final next month.

“When you are 10 against 11 playing such a strong team it’s no longer a contest.”

Mbappe made sure of the Parisian’s visit to the Stade de France next month with a superb solo effort with 20 minutes left, embarrassing Bruno Guimaraes and Marcelo before calmly slotting past Anthony Lopes.

Pablo Sarabia added a fourth with a stinging low strike 11 minutes later, and Mbappe completed his hat-trick in stoppage time, tapping home Neymar’s cross after good work on the left from the world’s most expensive footballer.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mbappe-takes-psg-into-french-cup-final.html

Manish had no trouble going past Taiwan’s Chu-En Lai in a unanimous 5-0 result to set up a contest with third seed Chinzorig Baatarsukh of Mongolia.

Also advancing to last eight is Sachin Kumar in 81 Kg category after he won 5-0 against Samoa’s Loapa Dee.

In the morning session, Ashish notched up a thumping win over fourth-seeded Kyrgyz Omurbek Bekzhigit Uulu, prevailing 5-0 in the lop-sided contest to set up a clash with Indonesia’s Maikhel Roberrd Muskita.

Muskita defeated New Zealand’s Ryan Scaife in his pre-quarterfinal bout. Making the semifinals would assure both Ashish and Manish of their maiden berths in the Olympics scheduled in July-August this year.

Ashish opened the day for India and produced a tactically nuanced performance. Up against a spunky rival, he played the waiting game to perfection, allowing Uulu to expend himself trying to connect.

Uulu swung his arms more than the Indian but it was Ashish who connected more accurately in the opening three minutes.

The Kyrgyz boxer kept up the pressure in the second round as well and managed to land a couple of solid rights, which caught the Indian off-guard and led to scores being split.

But Ashish’s powerful and precise right hand served him well in the final three minutes as judges ruled unanimously in his favour.

Manish, on the other hand, put his power to good effect. The nimble-footed Armyman hardly gave any opportunity to his rival and scored at will on counter-attacks.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ashish--manish-enter-quarters.html

“When someone insults you and your family is there and your family gets involved with somebody who is insulting you, in this case a younger brother, I think Eric did what we professionals cannot do but, I repeat, probably everyone of us would do,” said Mourinho.

“I am with the player and I understand the player.”

Dier scored his penalty in the shootout, but Erik Lamela, Troy Parrott and Gedson Fernandes missed from the spot to condemn Spurs to a fourth straight defeat in all competitions.

On the prospect of the club taking disciplinary action against Dier, Mourinho added: “If the club does that I will not agree, but he did wrong.”

Jan Vertonghen headed Tottenham into an early lead, but Mourinho’s decision to hand 36-year-old goalkeeper Michel Vorm his first appearance of the season backfired.

The Dutchman spilt a long-range effort from Kenny McLean and Josip Drmic bundled home the rebound to level 12 minutes from time.

Both sides then tired badly in extra-time, but neither could find a winner and Mourinho again blamed his stretched resources without the injured Harry Kane and Son Heung-min to injury for defeat.

“Some of my players were really in trouble and they made an incredible effort to try,” said Mourinho.

“I don’t have one single negative feeling towards my players. I can cope with negative moments in football, but I feel really sorry for my players.”

Norwich will host Derby or Manchester United in their first quarter-final since 1992.

City win

Manchester City will travel to Newcastle in the last eight after winning a 20th consecutive domestic cup tie 1-0 win at Sheffield Wednesday thanks to Aguero’s winner.

Wednesday goalkeeper Joe Wildsmith failed to get a strong enough hand to the Argentine’s low strike eight minutes into the second half.

A solitary goal was scant reward for the dominance of Pep Guardiola’s men, but they maintained hopes of a cup treble after lifting a third consecutive League Cup on Sunday and beating Real Madrid 2-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.

“He is a good manager and crazy,” said Aguero of Guardiola’s relentless demand to keep winning.

Leicester also booked their place in the last eight with a much-needed 1-0 win over Birmingham thanks to Ricardo Pereira’s late header.

The Foxes have won just one of their last seven Premier League games to stall their charge towards the Champions League next season and will host Chelsea in the quarter-finals.

“In the second half we dominated — lots of quick combos and the goal was coming. It was an excellent display.”

Sheffield United will host Arsenal in the other quarter-final tie.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/spurs-pay-price-for-penalties-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/spurs-pay-price-for-penalties.html
201,06-3-20,"Don't wanna bowl to Verma, Mandhana during powerplay: Oz pacer Megan Schutt wary of hammering , Mar 6 (PTI)","Clobbered by Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana recently, Australian pacer Megan Schutt says she hates playing against India and doesn't want to bowl at the marauding duo during powerplay when the two teams clash in the Women's T20 World Cup final here on Sunday.

Schutt, who took a crucial 2/17 in Australia's five-run win over South Africa in the rain-hit semifinal on Thursday, has still not recovered from the drubbing she got at the hands of Verma in the tournament-opener.

She was hit for four boundaries by Verma in her opening over of the tournament, and Schutt admitted her concerns about bowling to Indian openers.

""I just hate playing India - they've got the wood over me,"" Schutt was quoted as saying by the official website of the ICC.

""Smriti and Shefali have got me covered. That six Shafali hit me for in the tri-series was probably the biggest one I've ever been hit for.

""There are obviously some plans we're going to revisit as bowlers. (But) clearly, I'm not the best match-up to those two in the Powerplay. They find me quite easy to play,"" she added.

Schutt bore the brunt of Verma and Mandhana's attacking fury in the very first over of last month's tri-series as well. She was struck for four by Verma off the first ball and lifted for a six by Mandhana.

But both the sides will again meet each other in Sunday's summit clash, where India will have an edge after stunning the defending champions by 17 runs in the tournament opener.

""We're at that final we've been talking about for so long and against India, which is super fitting considering the tri-series we had. It couldn't really be a bigger challenge for us,"" Schutt said.

""It's not really a bad thing, it's good we're going up against a team we've played a lot recently and it's the same for them as well.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/don-t-wanna-bowl-to-verma--mandhana-during-powerplay--oz-pacer-megan-schutt-wary-of-hammering----mar-6--pti--2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/don-t-wanna-bowl-to-verma--mandhana-during-powerplay--oz-pacer-megan-schutt-wary-of-hammering----mar-6--pti-.html

The rupee too depreciated 53 paise to 73.86 against the US dollar in morning session.

Incessant foreign fund outflow also spooked market participants, traders said.

After sinking 1,459.52 points in early trade, the 30-share index was down 1052.33 points, or 2.74 per cent, at 37,418.28, and the NSE Nifty plunged 318.30 points, or 2.82 per cent, to 10,950.70.

On a net basis, foreign institutional investors (FPIs) sold equities worth Rs 2,476.75 crore, while domestic institutional investors bought shares worth Rs 2,510.89 crore on Thursday, data available with stock exchanges showed.

Shares of Yes Bank tanked 25 per cent after the capital-starved lender was placed under a moratorium, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) capping deposit withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account for a month and superseding its board.

Yes Bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

The rare move, made by the RBI and the government, came hours after finance ministry sources confirmed that State Bank of India (SBI) was directed to bail out the troubled lender.

SBI cracked over 6 per cent, and was among the top losers on Sensex.

IndusInd Bank, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, Axis Bank and Ultratech Cement were also in the red.

According to traders, investor sentiment was hit by intense selling in global equities as heightened volatility on concerns over the economic impact of coronavirus on world economies plagued markets.

Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo cracked up to 3 per cent.

Stock exchanges in the US too ended up to 3 per cent lower on Thursday.

208,06-3-20,"RBI caps Yes Bank withdrawal at `50K, supersedes board","Troubled private sector lender Yes Bank was placed under a “moratorium” on late Thursday, with the RBI capping depositor withdrawals at `50,000 per account for a month and superseding the board with immediate effect.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took the decision in consultation with the government to protect depositors’ interest.

The RBI also superseded the board of Yes Bank, which has not been able to raise required capital for the last six months. It also appointed former Chief Financial Officer of SBI, Prashant Kumar as the administrator of Yes Bank.

“The Reserve Bank came to the conclusion that in the absence of a credible revival plan, and in public interest and the interest of the bank’s depositors, it had no alternative but to apply to the central government for imposing a moratorium under Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949,” the RBI said in a statement late in the evening.

The statement said the bank management had indicated that it was in talks with various investors and they were likely to be successful. The bank was also engaged with a few private equity firms for exploring opportunities to infuse capital.

“These investors did hold discussions with senior officials of the Reserve Bank but for various reasons eventually did not infuse any capital.

“Since a bank and market-led revival is a preferred option over a regulatory restructuring, the Reserve Bank made all efforts to facilitate such a process and gave adequate opportunity to the bank’s management to draw up a credible revival plan, which did not materialise,” the statement said.

In the meantime, the bank was facing regular outflow of liquidity, the apex bank said, justifying its actions.

The actions come hours after sources said the government has approved a plan wherein State Bank of India (SBI) and other financial institutions would bailout Yes Bank.

If the plan is implemented, it would be the first major instance in many years where a private sector lender would be bailed out using public money.

In 2004, Global Trust Bank was amalgamated with Oriental Bank of Commerce and in 2006, IDBI Bank took over United Western Bank.

The curbs on Yes Bank come after similar action was taken against fraud-hit cooperative lender PMC Bank in September, where depositors are still in the lurch.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rbi-caps-yes-bank-withdrawal-at--50k--supersedes-board-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/rbi-caps-yes-bank-withdrawal-at--50k--supersedes-board.html
209,06-3-20,"Absconding councillor Tahir held in IB man’s murder, rioting cases","The Delhi Police arrested absconding AAP councillor Tahir Hussain (suspended by the party) on Thursday after a court here dismissed his plea seeking to surrender before it.

After his name surfaced in the killing of Intelligence Bureau (IB) official Ankit Sharma during the recent communal violence in North-east Delhi, the cops were looking for him and had conducted several raids in the riot-hit and other areas of the Capital.

Hussain will be produced before a court on Friday.

On Thursday, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) Vishal Pahuja of the Rowse Avenue court rejected Hussain’s plea saying the relief sought by him was outside its jurisdiction.

Hussain had moved the surrender application before the court saying he is willing to join the investigation and wanted to surrender in the case.

The court said as per the provisions of 177 Criminal Procedure of Code (Ordinary place of enquiry and trial), the offence shall ordinarily be enquired into and tried by court within whose local jurisdiction it is committed.

“In the instant case, the offence has been committed within the jurisdiction of Dayalpur police station which falls within the jurisdiction of Karkardooma Court. The reason given in the application for moving this application does not justify the conduct of the applicant to choose this forum for seeking the reliefs,” the ACMM said.

Advocate Mukesh Kalia, appearing for Hussain, submitted that there is a grave apprehension of threat to his life and therefore he has not surrendered before competent court as there is charged environment in Karkardooma District court.

He said Hussain has no connection or involvement in the FIR registered by the police and he is being falsely implicated. “Considering the gravity of the situation, Hussain wishes to surrender before the court,” he said.

The court said the Delhi High Court has specifically made a division of the jurisdictions, be that of the police stations or the courts district-wise and work has been allocated accordingly.

It said, “This court is a special designated court dealing with the matters of MPs/MLAs. The High Court has designated this court as special court to deal with cases on fast track with endeavour to dispose of the same within one year as its objective.

“The applicant does not fall in the aforesaid category, hence this application cannot be even entertained by this court.”

Hussain has been booked in the murder case of the IB staffer amid violence over the new citizenship law last week. Delhi’s ruling AAP had then suspended him for alleged involvement in the violence which has left at least 44 people dead and around 250 injured.

The family of Sharma (26), who was found dead in a drain near his home in northeast Delhi’s riot-hit Chand Bagh area, has accused Hussain of being behind the killing.

On the complaint of Sharma’s father, the police registered an FIR against Hussain, who has rejected the charge.

Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi four days ago after violence between anti-and-pro-Citizenship (Amendment) Act groups spiralled out of control.

210,06-3-20,"Crisis over, Nath tells Cong; 1 MLA resigns","The Congress seemed to have survived a major crisis in Madhya Pradesh with Chief Minister Kamal Nath conveying to the party high command that all the (remaining) MLAs, who were “abducted” by the BJP are expected to be back soon.

However, “disgruntled” Congress MLA Hardeep Singh Dang, who was one of the ruling camp MLAs taken away allegedly by the BJP outside the State, resigned from the Madhya Pradesh Assembly on Thursday. His resignation letter is yet to be received by the Secretariat.

Of the 14 MLAs who went “missing” , ten are already back to the Congress fold. Four others camping in hotel in Bangalore are expected to be back to Bhopal in the next 24 hours, Congress sources said.

They added the “missing” MLAs included 11 from the Congress, two from the BSP and one from Samjawadi Party.

The Congress said its Government in MP was “stable” despite BJP’s attempt to destabilise it ahead of Rajya Sabha elections.

Sources in the party said senior leaders, including Kamal Nath, are in touch with the MLAs and conveyed to the leadership that the Government was fully “stable”.

Karnataka Congress strongman D Shivakumar is back in action after it was reported BJP leaders “forcibly” took four MLAs to Bangalore.

The Congress currently has 113 MLAs, and one Independent Pradeep Jaiswal has joined the party. So in the House of 230 with two vacancies, the Congress has 114 MLAs.

A group of Congress, BSP and SP MLAs reached Bhopal in a special plane along with Madhya Pradesh Finance Minister Tarun Bhanot on Wednesday late night.

The Congress on Thursday morning held a Press conference at AICC headquarters in which it claimed the BJP “abducted 14 MLAs” to bring down its Government in Madhya Pradesh.

In a statement the party said the Congress Government in the State was stable and that the plans of the BJP will never materialise. The BJP is now “steeped in despair” and its defeat in the upcoming by-elections to the Jora and Agar assembly seats is now imminent, the Congress said in the statement.

“Two BSP MLAs, Ramabai Parihar and Sanjeev Kushwaha, have reiterated their support for the Congress even today. Radhe Shukla of the Samajwadi Party has also expressed her faith in the Government. Independent MLAs Kedar Davar and Vikram Singh Rana are also with the Congress,” said a Congress statement.

The BSP and SP legislators, who were brought back by a special plane by Congress leaders to Bhopal, denied charges of horse-trading and abduction by BJP leaders and reiterated their support to the Kamal Nath Government. BSP MLAs Ram Bai and Sanjeev Singh Kushwaha and SP legislator Rajesh Shukla denied that any BJP leader contacted them and offered a deal.

Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad accused the BJP of trying to bring down the Kamal Nath Government by “abducting the MLAs” of the ruling alliance.

Three Rajya Sabha seats are falling vacant in Madhya Pradesh and they are currently held by Congress’ Digvijaya Singh, and the BJP’s Satyanarayan Jatiya and Prabhat Jha.

“The BJP has been systematically destroying democracy in every State since it came to power. It started with Arunachal Pradesh, then Karanataka and then recently in Himachal Pradesh, despite the BJP not being in majority, a BJP CM took oath,” Azad said briefing the media.

“What is going on in Madhya Pradesh is not a first. It is perhaps the third or fourth attempt. We condemn this and if this goes on, we will take strict action against it. We urge other parties to join us in this fight. We have never done politics of this kind where we scare and intimidate people to join us,” he said.

Congress leader and party chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the BJP “abducted 14 MLAs” and accused the saffron party of being hand in glove with the “mafia” in Madhya Pradesh who want to topple the Congress government in the state.

Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said in the sinister design of the BJP in breaking State Governments, they have hatched a plan to dig the grave of democracy in the country.

“By doing this heinous activity, they want to destabilise the Congress regime. They are putting pressure on Congress leaders in Madhya Pradesh by adopting the carrot and stick policy,” he said, urging all Opposition parties to unite against the “authoritarian” Government.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/crisis-over--nath-tells-cong--1-mla-resigns.html

She said the steps taken are in the interest of depositors, banks and the economy.

“We are fully of seized of the development. RBI governor has assured me that there will be no loss to any depositor,” she added.

Sitharaman insisted the immediate priority to ensure Yes Bank customers are able to withdraw money within Rs 50,000 limit.

For the next month, Yes Bank will be led by the RBI-appointed administrator Prashant Kumar, an ex-chief financial officer of SBI.

The board of country's largest lender State Bank of India on Thursday gave an ""in-principle"" approval to invest in the capital-starved Yes Bank.

Yes Bank has been struggling to execute a capital raising plan for the last six months. Its core equity tier-I ratio had slipped to 8.7 per cent as of September.

The tournament, sanctioned by the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF), was to be held from March 15 to 25 in the capital's Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range.

The Olympic Test event was scheduled to be held from April 16.

""The tournament in Delhi will now be held in two parts before the Olympic Games. Dates for the events will be announced shortly,"" a National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) official said.

The decision comes after the government imposed several restrictions on the entry of travellers from affected countries such as China, Italy, South Korea, Japan and Iran, in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

In all, 22 countries had pulled out of the event, a source in NRAI told PTI.

""While 22 was the last count till Thursday night, some counties who had withdrawn, have also reapplied for visas,"" the source said.

The government's list of guidelines also states that the visa of all foreign nationals, who have visited the affected countries in the year 2020 and have not yet landed in India, will be cancelled.

The Delhi event was to be a combined World Cup for rifle/pistol and shotgun shooters.

In the wake of the Coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, many sporting events across the world have been either cancelled or postponed in recent weeks.

""It is critical for the State Government to put in place effective response and preparedness measures. The capacity of public healthcare facilities must be augmented to respond to any potential outbreak,"" Gandhi said.

""Increased disease surveillance, and strengthening the testing facilities could help early detection and containment,"" she said. ""The State Government must lend all possible support to public health care responders to carry out their duty effectively.""

The Congress leader pointed out that the World Health Organization had warned of severe shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially for frontline health workers, and had estimated that manufacturers must increase production by 40 per cent to meet requirements.

""I urge the State Government to ensure adequate supply of PPE, especially in public healthcare facilities, and initiate effective measures to prevent hoarding and black-marketing,"" she said. ""It is equally important to strengthen the intensive care facilities to meet any potential contingency.""

216,06-3-20,Sitharaman hits back at Chidambaram for jibe over Yes Bank crisis,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday hit back at senior Congress leader P Chidambaram for his jibe over crisis-hit Yes Bank's loan book swelling five times under BJP rule, saying ""self-appointed competent doctors"" created more problems in handling crisis at three banks during the UPA regime.

She blamed Chidambaram for the crisis at Global Trust Bank in July 2004 and the problems at IDBI which had to merge with on-the-verge of collapsing United Western Bank in 2006.

The Congress-led UPA had come to power in May 2004 and Chidambaram was the finance minister.

Addressing a press conference after the RBI superseded the board of Yes Bank and placed withdrawal restrictions, she said the crisis-hit lender's exposure to stressed corporates dates before 2014.

""The exposure of Yes Bank to some of the very stressed corporates has been before 2014. These are public domain names and I am not violating any customer privacy — Anil Ambani (Group), Essel Group, DHFL, IL&FS (and) Vodafone are some of the very stressed corporate to whom Yes Bank has been exposed,"" she said.

Sitharaman said she is revealing these names as the opposition parties were ""very keen to point fingers"".

""I am not here to continue carrying the stories of legacy. Yes, the Indian banking system has had severe challenges thanks to the way in which the government which existed between 2004-14 had handled the matter. I have reasons to put the blame on them,"" she said.

Sitharaman went on to question Chidambaram's handling of the crisis at two banks under the UPA-1 rule.

""So-called self-appointed competent doctors"" were in charge when United Western Bank was ""almost on the verge of collapse in 2006 and was forcefully merged with IDBI,"" she said. ""Today if I have problems restoring good health of IDBI, I am giving you good examples of how self-appointed competent doctors had handled UWB merger with IDBI.""

IDBI, she said, went down because of UWB. ""That was the treatment offered by those who speak today.""

""We have ensured that the interest of customers is kept safe, we are doing that. Their solution for UWB has resulted in IDBI also losing"" its base, she said adding Global Trust Bank was merged with OBC and Ganesh Bank of Kurudher was merged with a private bank.

""Easy merge it and wash your hands off,"" she said. ""In all three you merged and washed your hands off.""

The former finance minister Chidambaram had in a series of tweets questioning the crisis at Yes Bank and asked why should state-owned State Bank of India (SBI) invest in the beleaguered lender.

When overall bank credit between 2014 and 2019 grew by about 10 per cent, Yes Bank's loan book grew by about 35 per cent, he said. ""Who knows, FM may blame the UPA for the miraculous jump between 2014 and 2019 !!!""

FM is a short form of finance minister.

""I understand FM has made a statement blaming the UPA. That's normal for a government living in ignorance. Does the FM know the numbers that I have tweeted? If she does, will she please explain how the loan book jumped in five years from Rs 55,633 crore to Rs 2,41,499 crore?""

In another tweet, Chidambaram said, ""SBI should take over the loan book of YES Bank for one rupee, recover the loans, and simultaneously assure the depositors that their money will be safe and will be returned.""

Sitharaman said she has repeatedly said that she will not allow any institution to fall off a cliff.

""I do remember I said in the context of non-banking finance companies and we have been a daily basis monitoring the banking and shadow banking institutions,"" she said.

Questioning Chidambaram's handling of banks, she asked action against how many people were taken by the UPA to task for the problems at banks.

""And here you see them quickly jump to say 'oh no no you don't know what you are doing? You don't know how you are handling the economic affairs',"" she said. ""We are ensuring the customers' interest is intact, we are ensuring that depositors are assured and money is safe. You forcefully merge it off, let go off offenders and now ask questions uncomfortable for yourself.""

Stating that she has no problem answering questions on the handling of the economy, the minister said her government's approach so ensures institutions don't collapse and that they are kept in good health and interest of customers and depositors are kept safe.

""We assure all the depositors that their money is safe. We shall ensure that speedily this will be resolved and restructuring will happen in the interest of depositors and economy,"" she added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sitharaman-hits-back-at-chidambaram-for-jibe-over-yes-bank-crisis-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sitharaman-hits-back-at-chidambaram-for-jibe-over-yes-bank-crisis.html

In a bid to keep the lawmakers abreast about the steps being taken, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan told Parliament that public health authorities are focusing on India’s “core capacities for disease preparedness and response.” He also informed that States have been asked to form rapid response teams at district, block and village levels.

India has so far reported 30 cases of COVID-19. These include the previous three cases from Kerala, who have now been discharged. In addition, there are three from Delhi and NCR, (two with travel history from Italy, and one with travel history of Iran, six contacts of the first Delhi case with travel history of Italy, one from Telangana with history of Dubai travel and Singapore contact.

Till date, a total of 6,49,452 passengers have been screened at the airports from 6550 flights while around 29,607 persons are under the community surveillance and contact tracing. Besides the Pune lab, testing of clinical samples has also been initiated in 15 more laboratories. Another 19 laboratories are being prepared to test samples to ensure adequate geographical spread across the country.

India Inc on its part too has stepped up their employee safety efforts.

A day ago, Paytm announced shutting down its various branches for two days after one of its employees in Gurugram unit was found to be positive for the COVID-19.

219,06-3-20,"7 Cong MPs snatch papers from Speaker table, lose Session","The Lok Sabha on Thursday suspended seven Congress members for the remaining period of the Budget Session for “gross misconduct” and “utter disregard” for House rules after they snatched papers from the Speaker’s table.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said, “Snatching papers from the Speaker’s table is utmost disrespect to the Chair.”

The Congress described the suspension of MPs as vengeful and demanded suspension of a Rajasthan MP over his controversial remarks against Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her family members.

Reacting to the development, Congress’s leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said it was a “Government decision” and not one taken by the Speaker. Asserting that the Congress members had done nothing wrong, Chowdhury said it was a “dictatorial decision” and one that was motivated by “revenge politics”.

“We saw revenge politics in House, orders were given by the chairperson to suspend seven Cong MPs for this session,” he said, adding, “Whether suspending seven MPs is right, people will decide. We will not be scared and will continue to raise the Delhi riots issue.”

Gaurav Gogoi, who was among the suspended MPs, said, “Suspend us for a year, but discuss the Delhi riots and heal the wounds of people.”

Before the suspension motion was moved and passed , the House witnessed repeated adjournments. As soon as the House reassembled at 3 pm following an adjournment triggered by Rajasthan MP Hanuman Benwal’s remarks against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul, BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi, who was presiding the House, named Gaurav Gogoi, TN Prathapan, Dean Kuriakose, Manicka Tagore, Rajmohan Unnithan, Benny Behanan and Gurjeet Singh Aujla. The members were asked to leave the House immediately.

Once a member is named by the Chair, he or she cannot attend the House for that day.

She said when the House was discussing the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020, some members “forcefully” snatched and tossed papers from the Speaker’s podium.

“Such unfortunate incident has possibly happened for the first time in the parliamentary history...I condemn this behaviour,” she said while naming the members.

The Parliamentary Affairs Minister then moved a motion to suspend the members from the House for the remaining period of the Budget Session. The motion was passed by a voice vote amid protests by Opposition members.

“...That this House having taken serious note of gross misconduct of these members’ utter disregard to the House and authority of the Chair and having been named by the Speaker resolve that these members be suspended from the service of the House from the remainder of the session,” he said.

Lekhi then asked the seven members to leave Lok Sabha chambers immediately and then adjourned the House for the day.

All this while Congress members were in the Well demanding suspension of Beniwal, an MP of Rashtriya Loktantrik Party, a regional outfit from Rajasthan which is backed by the BJP, over his controversial remarks against Sonia Gandhi and her family members with a reference to coronavirus screening and related safety measures.

Congress members stormed the Well of the House as soon as Beniwal said there should be a probe on whether coronavirus is being spread from the “home” of Sonia Gandhi as a large number of people who were found to be affected by the virus are from Italy.

“Earlier, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said that party leader Rahul Gandhi had forewarned the Government on the impending threat from coronavirus. There should be a probe to find out if the spread of the virus originated from Sonia Gandhi’s home,” the Rajasthan MP remarked.

Beniwal made the remark during the House proceedings before 2 pm when Rajendra Agarwal was in the chair. He said the remarks of Beniwal will not go on records and immediately adjourned the House till 2 pm.

At 2 pm when House resumed its proceedings Congress members stormed into the Well demanding suspension of Beniwal. As Rama Devi, who was in the chair then, continued to run the proceedings of the House, Congress members intensified sloganeering saying, “Suspend the MP, Modi Sarkar shame shame”.

At this point the process of passing the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was underway, when Gogoi of the Congress was seen throwing papers kept on the Lok Sabha Speaker’s podium. Soon after, Rama Devi adjourned the House till 3 pm. When the House resumed proceedings at 3 pm, Lekhi announced suspension of seven Congress MPs and adjourned the House for the day after the House passed a resolution for suspension of Opposition members.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/7-cong-mps-snatch-papers-from-speaker-table--lose-session-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/7-cong-mps-snatch-papers-from-speaker-table--lose-session.html
220,06-3-20,Turkey-Russia agreed ceasefire in Syria's Idlib comes into force,"A ceasefire in northern Syria agreed between Russia and Turkey came into force on Friday, aiming to halt intense fighting that has sparked a humanitarian disaster and raised fears of their armies clashing.

The deal struck between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan comes after an escalation of violence in Idlib, the northwestern province of Syria where Ankara is battling Moscow-backed government forces.

Nearly a million civilians have fled their homes due to the bloodshed and dozens of Turkish soldiers have been killed.

Putin and Erdogan agreed on the ceasefire from midnight on Friday (2200 GMT) after more than six hours of talks in Moscow.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ""hopes that this agreement will lead to an immediate and lasting cessation of hostilities that ensures the protection of civilians in northwest Syria"", his spokesman said in a statement Thursday.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor, which had reported bombings just minutes before the midnight deadline, said there was ""relative"" calm in the region after the ceasefire came into operation.

The Britain-based Observatory reported that Russian and Syrian air strikes had halted but said there was ""artillery fire... By Syrian regime forces on the positions of insurgent groups"" in areas controlled by jihadists in parts of Aleppo and Hama bordering Idlib.

The situation in Idlib, the last rebel stronghold in Syria's nine-year civil war, had become critical as Ankara for the first time launched a direct offensive against President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

Earlier, Putin told a joint press conference that the agreement would ""serve as a good basis for ending fighting"" in Idlib.

Erdogan, however, added that Turkey reserved the right to ""retaliate with all its strength against any attack"" by Damascus.

The agreement will also create a security corridor along the key M4 highway in northern Syria, where Turkish and Russian forces will launch joint patrols from March 15.

Russia has requested a closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council for Friday in order to brief members on the agreement, a diplomatic source told AFP.

But there was scepticism over the deal among those displaced by the fighting.

""I don't think this will last long,"" Mouawiya Agha, originally from Sarmin in the south of the province, told AFP.

""It will end like the ones before,"" said the 33-year-old father of four, referring to an agreement reached in the Russian city of Sochi in 2018 that created a ""de-escalation"" zone in Idlib.

Turkey has long backed certain rebel groups against Assad but its priority now is to stop an influx of refugees among those fleeing an offensive the regime has been pressing on Idlib since December.

Ankara has demanded the European Union support its actions in Syria and last week opened its border with EU member Greece to migrants -- a move decried by some in the bloc as ""blackmail"".

In the run-up to Thursday's talks, Russia and Turkey had traded accusations of violating the deal.

Turkey officially declared an operation against the Assad government over the weekend, after 34 Turkish soldiers died in an air strike blamed on Damascus.

It has since downed three Syrian warplanes and killed dozens of soldiers and allied fighters, according to monitors.

Two more Turkish soldiers were killed by Syrian regime fire in Idlib, the defence ministry said, just hours before the ceasefire took effect.

The Turkish defence ministry said early Friday Turkish armed drones ""neutralised"" 21 regime troops in strikes at 4pm local time Thursday in retaliation for the soldiers who were killed.

The deal leaves open the fate of the Turkish observation posts in Idlib, which have been surrounded since Damascus launched its offensive.

But it does mark the first time Russian and Turkish forces will operate jointly in Idlib.

The security corridor along the M4 highway, which connects second city Aleppo to the coast through Idlib, will run six kilometres (around four miles) deep both north and south of the highway.

The joint Russian-Turkish patrols will operate between the town of Tronba in Idlib and a village in Latakia province, a regime stronghold.

Fighting continued elsewhere in Idlib on Thursday, with Russian air strikes killing at least 15 civilians gathered outside the town of Maaret Misrin, the Observatory said.

Erdogan warned Europe on Wednesday that it must support Turkey's ""political and humanitarian solutions in Syria"" if it wants to avoid a repeat of the 2015 migration crisis.

Thousands of migrants have massed at the Turkish-Greek border since Erdogan gave them the green light to try to enter Europe, leading to clashes with Greek police.

Turkey hosts roughly 3.6 million refugees from Syria -- and hundreds of thousands from elsewhere -- and Erdogan's move has sparked concern in Europe of a renewed influx of migrants.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/turkey-russia-agreed-ceasefire-in-syria-s-idlib-comes-into-force-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/turkey-russia-agreed-ceasefire-in-syria-s-idlib-comes-into-force.html
221,06-3-20,Elizabeth Warren drops out of US presidential race,"Senator Elizabeth Warren suspended her US presidential campaign on Thursday after a disappointing Super Tuesday that included a third-place finish in her home State of Massachusetts.

The 70-year-old leader, however, did not announce who she was endorsing for the Democratic presidential primaries which has now been reduced to a direct contest between former US Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.

""Today, I'm suspending our campaign for president,"" Warren said, two days after she failed to win a single Super Tuesday State.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday in Massachusetts, Warren said she'd likely endorse one of the two major Democratic candidates left in the race, but ""not today"".

""I need some space and I need a little time right now,"" she said.

Warren is the fourth Democratic leader in the last one week to withdraw from the party's race to the White House.

Biden had a convincing Democratic primary win in Massachusetts along with nine other Super Tuesday States.

A day before, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg had announced to withdraw from the race.

On the eve of the Super Tuesday, two other presidential aspirants Senator Amy Klobucher and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg withdrew from the race. All three of them rallied behind Biden to help him win the Democratic party's nomination and to challenge incumbent President Donald Trump in the November elections.

""Our work continues, the fight goes on, and big dreams never die,"" Warren told her supporters.

""I may not be in the race for president in 2020, but this fight — our fight — is not over. And our place in this fight has not ended,"" she added.

With the exit of Warren from the race, Hindu Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard remains the only female candidate in the Democratic party's presidential race.

However, she has failed to gain any traction in the primaries so far.

Trump was quick to take a dig at Warren.

""Elizabeth ""Pocahontas"" Warren, who was going nowhere except into Mini Mike's head, just dropped out of the Democrat Primary...THREE DAYS TOO LATE. She cost Crazy Bernie, at least, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas. Probably cost him the nomination! Came in third in Mass,"" he said in a tweet.

The Democratic Party at its national convention in Wisconsin will elect its nominee for the November polls.

The nominee must have 1991 of the 3979 pledge delegates. As of Thursday, Biden was leading the pack with 596 pledged delegates, followed by Sanders with 531.

On March 10, six States would hold their primaries: Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington.

This would be followed by primaries in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio on March 17. Political pundits believe that by then a front runner for the Democratic party would have secured his position.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/elizabeth-warren-drops-out-of-us-presidential-race-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/elizabeth-warren-drops-out-of-us-presidential-race.html
222,06-3-20,Facebook drops Trump ads after Pelosi cites census confusion,"Facebook on Thursday began taking down ads for the reelection campaign of President Donald Trump that direct people to a survey labeled a “census,” hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said people would confuse it with the once-a-decade head count.

Facebook said in a statement that it was enforcing its policies to prevent confusion over the 2020 census, which begins next week for most people.

“There are policies in place to prevent confusion around the official U.S. Census and this is an example of those being enforced,"" the Facebook statement said.

Earlier in the day, Pelosi had called the survey sponsored by the Trump reelection campaign, “an absolute lie."" “A lie that is consistent with the misrepresentation policy of Facebook,"" Pelosi said. “But now they're messing with who we are as Americans. I know the profit motive is their business model, but it should not come at the cost of counting who is in our country.""

The ad says, “President Trump needs you to take the Official 2020 Congressional District Census today."" Clicking on a red button saying “Take the Survey” leads to a website with questions asking visitors about party affiliation, whether they intend to support Trump and which media organizations they get their information, among other questions.

Similar mailings have been distributed around the U.S.

On Thursday, four Democratic House members — Reps. Carolyn Maloney of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Gerry Connolly of Virginia, and Katie Porter of California — demanded in a letter that the Republican National Committee stop any mailings or online ads that resemble Census Bureau documents.

In a statement, the Republican National Committee said it would add language to future mailings, making it clear what it is.

“This is a standard direct mail piece that has been utilized for decades. These mailers are fully compliant with the law, clearly marked as a fundraising solicitation from the Republican National Committee, and in no way resemble the official government census,"" the RNC statement said.

Census Bureau officials have been on high alert for online misinformation aimed at confusing people about who is eligible to fill out the form or how to properly file it, along with imitation websites posing as the official census site.

The bureau has spent the last year forging relationships with the major tech platforms -- Facebook, Twitter and Google — to put out accurate information about how the census works and yank misinformation about the form from their sites.

In January, Facebook began banning ads that discourage people from participating in the census or portray it as “useless.” The ban applies to ads on both Facebook and Instagram, which Facebook owns. The platform also announced that misleading posts about the census would be subject to removal. Typically, the platform does not remove false or misleading content from its site, unless it gives wrong information about voting.

The Trump campaign on Tuesday began running different versions of the census ad on Facebook across the country from Trump and Vice President Mike Pence's official Facebook page. The campaign purchased thousands of the online ads that were viewed thousands of times before Facebook began removing them Thursday.

Former Census Bureau director John Thompson said the Trump campaign has put a new spin on an old campaign strategy: For years, Republicans have sent fundraising mailers that mimic the census.

Although it's hard to tell if those tactics have had any impact on the response rate to the census, Thompson said “the less confusion, the better” when it comes to the once-every-decade survey.

Trump's ads and the Republican mailers could dupe some people into thinking they've already filled out the official census form, and if there's any consequence at all, it could be that the move backfires on Trump's own supporters, Thompson said.

“I don't know that they would want to have confusion,” said Thompson, who served in the Obama administration. “It could have a reverse impact on the Trump administration, (it) could create an under-representation of their constituents in the census.”

Meanwhile, in the U.S Senate, Democratic senators told U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, they felt misled by his testimony almost two years ago on the origins of a failed citizenship question. Ross was testifying Thursday before the Senate Committee on Appropriations.

The U.S. Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration last summer from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 questionnaire. The administration had said the question was being added to aid the Justice Department in enforcing a law that protects minority voters' access to the ballot box. But the high court said the administration's justification for the question “seems to have been contrived.” Opponents argued it would have intimidated immigrants, Hispanics and others from participating in the once-a-decade head count that determines how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is allocated and how many congressional seats each state gets.

“Your statements were totally false,"" Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont told Ross during the hearing. “There is now an avalanche of evidence showing you repeatedly pressured both the Justice Department and the Census Bureau for nearly a year to support adding the question."" Ross denied misleading the senators.

“”My statements were correct then. They were true then. They are correct now. They are true now,"" Ross said.

Leahy responded, “The evidence we've seen shows they were not true."" This is the first census in which the Census Bureau is encouraging most people to answer the questionnaire online, although people can still answer the questions by telephone or by mailing in a paper form. Residents can start answering the form next Thursday.

Separately, a federal judge in Maryland on Thursday denied a request for a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit the NAACP had filed against the Census Bureau, claiming its preparations for the 2020 census were inadequate. The NAACP wanted the judge to compel the bureau to hire more census takers in the field and open more field offices in hard to count communities.

“Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that if the census proceeds as planned, there will be a differential undercount of the magnitude they fear, or if I were to order the funds spent as they want, the 2020 census would not produce an equal or worst undercount for hard-to-count communities,"" U.S. District Judge Paul Grimm wrote.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/facebook-drops-trump-ads-after-pelosi-cites-census-confusion-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/facebook-drops-trump-ads-after-pelosi-cites-census-confusion.html

226,06-3-20,Nirbhaya rapists to hang on March 20,"If execution is delayed, SC to hear on March 23 Govt’s plea for hanging 4 convicts separately

Four convicts of the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder will be hanged on March 20 at 5.30 am, according to the death warrant issued by a Delhi Court on Thursday.

However, the Supreme Court on Thursday said it will step in on March 23 if convicts are not hanged on March 20. It would hear on March 23 the appeal filed by the Centre challenging the Delhi High Court order that the four death row convicts have to be executed simultaneously. The apex court said it would examine the legal issue arising out of the case on whether there could be separate hanging in a case where there are more than one death-row convict.

In Delhi court on Thursday, Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Dharmendra Rana fixed the new date after being informed by the Delhi Government that the convicts have exhausted all their legal remedies.

The death-row convicts are Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).

Their lawyer told the court that there was no legal impediment for it in proceeding to fix the date of execution. The Delhi Government had on Wednesday moved court seeking fresh date for the execution hours after President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the mercy petition of Pawan.

The Delhi Government had told the court that all legal remedies of the convicts have been exhausted and nothing survives now. The lawyer for the prosecution also said no notice was required. The court had on Monday deferred till further order the hanging of the convicts that was scheduled for Tuesday.

Meanwhile, in the apex court on Thursday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed the Bench, headed by Justice R Banumathi, that the trial court has fixed March 20 as date of execution of the four convicts who have exhausted all their legal remedies.

Mehta told the Bench, also comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Bopanna, that these convicts have made a mockery of the system by their delaying tactics and taken it for a ride. The Bench said it would hear the matter on merits on March 23 and made it clear that no adjournments will be granted.

The execution of their death warrants has been deferred thrice so far due to delays by them in exhausting legal remedies.

A 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ‘Nirbhaya’ (fearless), was gang raped and savagely assaulted in a moving bus in South Delhi on December 16, 2012. She had died after a fortnight.

Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused. Ram Singh, the sixth accused, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar jail days after the trial began in the case.

227,06-3-20,Pakistan does not want any security role for India in Afghanistan,"Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said Pakistan does not want any security role for India in Afghanistan as he accused New Delhi of playing the role of a ""spoiler"" in the war-torn country, according to a media report.

After months of negotiations, the US and Taliban signed a landmark peace deal in Qatari capital Doha on Saturday, effectively drawing curtains on the United States' 18-year war in Afghanistan since 2001.

Speaking in the Senate on Wednesday, Qureshi said that Pakistan neither desires “any security role of India in Afghanistan” nor wants presence of militant organisations — Al-Qaeda and the ISIS — in the landlocked country, The Nation reported.

The foreign minister told the Upper House that India had always played role of a spoiler, the report said.

“There were spoilers in the past and they are even today, within and outside Afghanistan, who want to get their own objectives,"" Qureshi said.

India has been a key stakeholder in Afghanistan as it had already spent around USD 2 billion in reconstruction of the war-ravaged country.

India has been maintaining that care should be taken to ensure that any peace process does not lead to any ""ungoverned spaces"" where terrorists and their proxies can relocate.

Ahead of the peace deal, India conveyed to the US that pressure on Pakistan to crack down on terror networks operating from its soil must be kept up though Islamabad's cooperation for peace in Afghanistan is crucial.

Qureshi on Sunday also warned that ""spoilers"" could try to sabotage the peace process in Afghanistan.

He also said that Pakistan wanted to resolve all issues with Afghanistan bilaterally.

Reiterating that Pakistan was never part of the peace talks and their role “has always been and will always be” that of a facilitator, the minister said Pakistan cannot give guarantee or take responsibility to peace in Afghanistan.

""This is a shared responsibility, and all (stakeholders) will have to play their role. There are many powers, interests and motives (involved),” he said.

He said that the true test of the Afghan leadership begins now as Afghan people want peace.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pakistan-does-not-want-any-security-role-for-india-in-afghanistan-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/pakistan-does-not-want-any-security-role-for-india-in-afghanistan.html
228,06-3-20,"Caffeine may boost problem-solving ability, not creativity: Study","Caffeine consumption may increase the ability to focus and solve problems, but it doesn't stimulate creativity, according to a study.

While the cognitive benefits of caffeine -- increased alertness, improved vigilance, enhanced focus and improved motor performance -- are well established, the stimulant's affect on creativity is less known, the researchers said.

""In Western cultures, caffeine is stereotypically associated with creative occupations and lifestyles, from writers and their coffee to programmers and their energy drinks, and there's more than a kernel of truth to these stereotypes,"" said Darya Zabelina, an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas in the US.

The study, published in the journal Consciousness and Cognition, differentiates ""convergent"" from ""divergent"" thinking.

The former is defined as seeking a specific solution to a problem, for example, the ""correct"" answer, while the latter is characterised by idea generation where a large set of apt, novel or interesting responses would be suitable.

Caffeine was shown to improve convergent thinking in the study, while consuming it had no significant impact on divergent thinking, the researchers said.

For the study, 80 volunteers were randomly given either a 200 milligramme (mg) caffeine pill, equivalent to one strong cup of coffee, or a placebo.

They were then tested on standard measures of convergent and divergent thinking, working memory and mood.

In addition to the results on creativity, caffeine did not significantly affect working memory, but test subjects who took it did report feeling less sad.

""The 200mg enhanced problem solving significantly, but had no effect on creative thinking,"" said Zabelina.

""It also didn't make it worse, so keep drinking your coffee; it won't interfere with these abilities,"" she said",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/caffeine-may-boost-problem-solving-ability--not-creativity--study-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/caffeine-may-boost-problem-solving-ability--not-creativity--study.html
229,06-3-20,'This is not a drill': WHO urges world to take virus more seriously,"World health officials have warned that countries are not taking the coronavirus crisis seriously enough, as outbreaks surged across Europe and in the United States where medical workers sounded warnings over a ""disturbing"" lack of hospital preparedness.

Global markets tumbled again over concerns about the impact on the economy and as countries took more drastic steps to prevent contagion of a disease that has killed more than 3,300 people and infected nearly 100,000 in about 85 nations.

Cases soared in Italy, France, Greece and Iran, while a cruise ship was held off the coast of California to test passengers showing symptoms of the disease -- echoing a harrowing episode in Japan several weeks ago that saw hundreds infected on a luxury liner.

The epidemic has wreaked havoc on international business, tourism, sports events and schools, with almost 300 million students sent home worldwide.

Even religion is affected: The Vatican said Pope Francis may have to change his schedule, Bethlehem was placed under lockdown, and Saudi Arabia emptied Islam's holiest site in Mecca to sterilise it.

China -- where the virus emerged late last year -- still accounts for the majority of cases and deaths, but infections are now rising faster abroad, with South Korea, Iran and Italy major hotspots.

The World Health Organisation warned Thursday that a ""long list"" of countries were not showing ""the level of political commitment"" needed to ""match the level of the threat we all face"".

""This is not a drill,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.

""This epidemic is a threat for every country, rich and poor.""

Tedros called on the heads of government in every country to take charge of the response and ""coordinate all sectors"", rather than leaving it to health ministries.

What is needed, he said, is ""aggressive preparedness"".

In the United States, the largest nursing union said a survey of thousands of nurses at hospitals showed ""truly disturbing"" results.

""They show that a large percentage of our nation's hospitals are unprepared to safely handle COVID-19,"" said Jane Thomason, a hygiene specialist with the union.

Nurses are working without necessary personal protective equipment and lack education and training for handling the disease, said National Nurses United director Bonnie Castillo.

The US Congress passed an emergency USD 8.3 billion spending bill to combat the coronavirus Thursday as cases surged in the country's northwest and deaths reached 12.

More than 180 people are infected in the US.

But President Donald Trump has downplayed the risk, saying the WHO's conclusion of a 3.4 per cent mortality rate was ""false"".

Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of health, estimated the death rate at ""somewhere between 0.1 per cent and one per cent"" -- closer to the seasonal flu -- due to a high number of unreported cases.

A National Guard helicopter dropped test kits on the deck of the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of San Francisco to determine if any of the nearly 3,500 guests and crew had contracted the new coronavirus.

Health officials sounded the alarm after two passengers who had been on board during a previous voyage later fell ill, and one of them died.

The ship belongs to Princess Cruises, the company that operated the Diamond Princess -- the coronavirus-stricken ship held off Japan last month from which more than 700 people tested positive and six died.

Cases in China have gradually fallen as tens of millions of people remain under strict quarantine to contain the virus.

But fresh infections rose for a second consecutive day on Friday, with 143 new cases, and 30 more deaths.

China's death toll now stands at 3,042 with over 80,500 infections.

Beijing faces a new concern with the number of cases imported from abroad rising to 36.

But cases are increasing faster in other countries.

Japan imposed a quarantine on arrivals from South Korea and China, angering Seoul which summoned the Japanese ambassador to protest the ""irrational"" move.

South Korea has the second biggest number of cases outside China, with over 6,000 infections and 42 deaths, prompting the country to extend school breaks by three weeks.

Italy, which has the biggest outbreak in Europe, has ordered schools and universities shut until March 15, and on Thursday reported a sharp rise in deaths, bringing the total to 148.

France also reported a steep jump in cases, bringing its total to 423 with seven deaths, as President Emmanuel Macron warned the country was heading towards an ""inevitable"" epidemic.

Fears about the economic fallout caused stock markets in Asia to open lower on Friday, with Tokyo losing more than 3.0 per cent by the break.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-this-is-not-a-drill---who-urges-world-to-take-virus-more-seriously-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/-this-is-not-a-drill---who-urges-world-to-take-virus-more-seriously.html
230,06-3-20,"11 coronavirus deaths in US, working hard to keep numbers low: Trump","The US has seen 11 deaths and reported 129 coronavirus infection cases, President Donald Trump said on Thursday, asserting that his administration is working ""very hard"" to keep the numbers ""as low as possible"".

The coronavirus outbreak which first originated in China in December last year has infected over 95,000 people and resulted in more than 3,200 deaths worlwide.

""With approximately 100,000 coronavirus cases worldwide, and 3,280 deaths, the United States, because of quick action on closing our borders, has, as of now, only 129 cases (40 Americans brought in) and 11 deaths,"" Trump said in a tweet.

""We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!"" said the president who has made his deputy Vice President Mike Pence head of the efforts of his administration to address the challenges posed by the deadly virus.

Trump also retweeted posts of some of the lawmakers who have appreciated his handling of the coronavirus crisis.

""I want to commend the President for how he has handled the Coronavirus situation, especially his early decision to shut down access into our Country from China, despite strong opposition to that decision,"" Senator Tom Cotton said.

Pence told Fox News that the American people should know that according to all experts, the risk of contracting the coronavirus for the average American remains low.

""Nevertheless, beginning in January this president took unprecedented action suspending all travel from China, quarantining Americans that came home. We recently established screening in Italy and in South Korea while we put travel advisories on areas of those countries,"" he said.

""But our focus is specifically now on putting the healthy and safety of Americans first. We have over 100 Americans who have contracted the disease. Most are recovering and doing well,"" he added.

Pence on Thursday travelled to Washington State to meet with the Governor and ensure that the US capital has all the support that it needs to confront the concentration of cases.

232,06-3-20,US tests stranded cruise ship passengers for coronavirus,"Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of San Francisco were confined to their cabins Thursday as tests were conducted to determine if any of the nearly 3,500 guests and crew had contracted the new coronavirus.

Authorities said the Grand Princess, which had been scheduled to dock on Wednesday, would remain at sea until the test results of those who had shown symptoms of the virus are known.

The California National Guard said it had flown test kits to the ship Thursday morning and the findings were expected to be announced early Friday.

Carolyn Wright, a passenger, told AFP that the captain announced Thursday evening that there were ""no confirmed cases of coronavirus"" and that final results would be released the following day.

Health officials sounded the alarm after two passengers who had been on board during a previous voyage between San Francisco and Mexico later fell ill and one of them died.

Several other passengers who had remained on the vessel for its next voyage to Hawaii also developed flu-like symptoms during that trip.

Officials said there were 2,383 passengers and 1,100 crew on board the ship.

Wright said there was no panic on board and people seemed to be taking the setback in stride.

""I can't get over how the news is sensationalising our ship,"" said the 63-year-old professional photographer from New Mexico who was travelling with a friend.

""There were two cases on the previous cruise and they act like everybody on board has the plague.""

She said passengers had been free to roam about the ship but on Thursday were told after lunch to remain in their cabins.

""I think it's all closing the barn after the horse has left,"" Wright said via text messages.

""I'm not really worried. If you look at the odds, our risk is pretty low.""

She said the passengers -- most of them between 60 and 90 years old -- were in good spirits ""although that may change if we are stuck in our cabins for too long.""

""Everyone was calm and content up until now,"" she said.

""But room service isn't answering and people are going to get upset quickly without food or liquor.""

Health officials said it was unclear when or where the ship would be allowed to dock.

Various agencies ""are working to determine if COVID-19 is present on the ship,"" Mary Ellen Carroll, the head of the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management, told reporters, referring to the formal name of the virus.

She said 35 people had shown flu-like symptoms during the 15-day cruise, but many have already recovered.

Carroll said once test results are back, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and California state officials will determine the most appropriate location for the ship to berth.

""The location needs to provide for the safety of the surrounding community, as well as the passengers and crew,"" she said.

""The CDC and the state are considering a number of locations, including San Francisco.""

California Governor Gavin Newsom said authorities were trying to contact some of the 2,500 passengers who were on board the previous voyage.

The Grand Princess belongs to Princess Cruises, the same company which operated the Diamond Princess -- the coronavirus-stricken ship held off Japan last month from which more than 700 people tested positive and six died.

233,06-3-20,Genetic sequencing tests being done on pet dog of coronavirus patient in Hong Kong,"Genetic sequencing tests are being carried out on the pet dog of a confirmed coronavirus patient in Hong Kong, which could reveal if the virus has mutated or not, an official has said.

Thomas Sit, the Assistant Director for Inspection & Quarantine of Hong Kong government's Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department, said that coronavirus is what is known as an RNA virus which eventually mutates.

""That is why the University of Hong Kong School of Public Health needs to do a genetic analysis to compare this dog's genetic sequencing to the virus isolated from the patient so that they can compare. So if it is totally identical, then there is no mutation. The testing is still ongoing,"" state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Sit as saying during a press briefing on Thursday.

He reiterated that international experts agreed that the dog has a low level of infection, despite its blood tests not being ready yet.

""From the first sample to our last sample tested, it has already been six days. The dog's nasal or oral mechanism, their secretion they should have - if contaminated - they should have a way to clean the virus, it would not stay for that long if it was just a contamination,"" he said.

""I think it will take at least five or seven days for the blood results because it is not an easy test, it is not a quick test. We need to grow a virus and then neutralise the serum, so it takes some time,"" he added.

Sit added that it was too early to say whether animal-to-animal transmission was a possibility.

""At this stage, we do not have enough data to have a 100-per cent answer as to whether it is infectious to other dogs or not. But if the dog's owner is positive, it is better to take precautionary measures to prevent onward transmission,"" he said.

Sit also advised dog owners to wash their hands, wear gloves and try to stop their dogs from licking their surroundings to prevent the virus from spreading further.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/genetic-sequencing-tests-being-done-on-pet-dog-of-coronavirus-patient-in-hong-kong-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/genetic-sequencing-tests-being-done-on-pet-dog-of-coronavirus-patient-in-hong-kong.html

It played on that fear and I felt abandoned so I drank. That night I went to a party, there was other stuff there and it was only three months before I ended up in the hospital with an over dose,"" she shared.

Lovato also shared how she dealt with eating disorder.

""I got the help I needed at the time and I took a 'one size fits all' approach and that was just sobriety.

237,06-3-20,Sona Mohapatra: Never wanted to be biggest playback singer,"Sona Mohapatra left a corporate job over a decade ago to be a musician. She now has a film of her own. She says she has never seen herself just as a singer and definitely not as somebody who wanted to be the biggest playback singer.

Also, no two days are the same for her.

""I wake up everyday so excited. I feel like I am a three-year-old. I cannot believe the blessed life that I have,"" Sona told IANS.

She believes that people are living in very interesting times right now.

""Nobody needs to be restricted as an artiste. I have never seen myself just as a singer and definitely not somebody who wanted to be the biggest playback singer. I always saw myself as an artiste, (as) somebody who will express herself in different ways, be a storyteller,"" she shared.

She finds films a powerful medium where ""so many of my interests came together, be it travelling or love for Indian folk music or exploring more about the kind of artistes across the centuries in India who have inspired me like Kabir, Mirabai, Amir Khusro, at the same time tied in this very contemporary milieu of where I inhabitate"".

""I live in fancy five stars (hotels) as a pop star. I get two lakh people showing up at my concerts, I get trolled, I get acid attack threats, I am morphed onto porn sites - all of that exciting stuff alongside the fact that India is such a generous and beautiful country,"" she added.

Along with her, Deepti Gupta, the director of her documentary ""Shut Up Sona"", has love for the country's roots.

""We made this journey of three years, 300 hours of footage, and in terms of a genre, I think it's first of its kind,"" said Sona.

The film's premiere at a Mumbai film festival last year was a significant event for her.

""As an artiste, I wanted to start with my own country. That's where I wanted an impact. This whole idea of going abroad and taking validation 'we have won so many laurels that's why you should watch us', was something like no, we should be celebrated at home,"" she said.

""People were laughing so much through the film. People in India have this misconception about documentaries that it's very serious, a niche thing and everything is very slow. Mine is a 'masaledar' documentary. It's a total fun ride and it made a lot of people emotional too. So I felt there must be something honest and true in it,"" she added about the film that the Delhi audience also got to watch at the Asian Women's Film Festival on Thursday.

""Shut Up Sona"", which was screened at the International Film Festival Rotterdam, revolves around her journey as a rock star, her brand of music, love for her country's roots and culture and how she has become symbol of hope of a larger movement.

Sona feels glad that she got to express herself in another medium.

""I had no one telling me that 'iska gaana nikaldo' (remove her song) , 'iski awaz bhaari hai' (her voice is heavy). I hope many more artistes, women take charge of the narrative and tell their stories. There should be much more of a feminine perspective in mainstream,"" said Sona.

""We need to see more of us in the open and not just by being the pretty face or waiting for a break or waiting for somebody else to give us an opportunity. I thought the opportunities for me were drying up. No one was giving me the next opportunity. I said 'okay either I start believing that I am not talented enough and sit down at home or I make my own journey happen'. That's the reason why I said 'let's just make a film',"" said the artiste, known for songs such as ""Bolo na"" and ""Ambarsariya"".",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sona-mohapatra--never-wanted-to-be-biggest-playback-singer-2020-03-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/sona-mohapatra--never-wanted-to-be-biggest-playback-singer.html

239,06-3-20,'Baaghi 3': The same old Tiger trick,"""Baaghi 3""; Cast: Tiger Shroff, Riteish Deshmukh, Shraddha Kapoor, Ankita Lokhande, Jameel Khoury, Jaideep Ahlawat, Vijay Varma; Direction: Ahmed Khan; Rating: Two and half star (* * and 1/2 stars)

The ""Baaghi"" films are basically all about creating enough situations to let (a preferably shirtless) Tiger Shroff flex biceps, bash up baddies and show off some cool dance moves. It's worked over two films, and that is good enough an excuse to bankroll a new sequel to flaunt the same old Tiger trick.

""Baaghi 3"" is all about cashing in on a ready fan base that is still game to relish a readymade formula. Over three films, the franchise has only grown bigger and more lavish with the trademark extravaganza that cocktails mayhem, melodrama, mush and music in that order. Strictly for franchise fans, ""Baaghi 3"" is as big as it gets.

For Tiger, his last two releases very much set the template on what fans demands from him right now. The ""Student Of The Year"" brand of soppy dish won't do, while the ""War"" variety of sexed-up machismo is guaranteed to have them hungering for more. Tiger's new film has been set up keeping that in mind.

""Baaghi 3"" is billed as a ‘spiritual sequel' -- which is to say the film conveniently draws on the formula that worked for the earlier ""Baaghi"" films without retaining any connection with those prequels in terms of characters or story. The only thing common across the three films so far is that Tiger Shroff's protagonist is called Ronnie, besides of course the fact that any resemblance that Ronnie has consecutively borne with Sylvester Stallone's Rambo is strictly intentional.

The ""Baaghi"" films basically have the same plot. Someone close to Ronnie ends up in a situation of distress in an alien land, and he must go out of his way to the rescue. In the first film, it was his lover in Bangkok. In the second, he was out saving his little daughter in Goa. This time it is the turn for some brotherly bond. With a bigger budget to splurge, the bandwagon moves to Syria.

Producer Sajid Nadiadwala's story casts Tiger and Riteish Deshmukh as brothers, who share a deep bond of affection. Ronnie, the more dashing of the two has been protective about Vikram since they were young. In a turn of events Vikram, a cop, is sent to Syria where, he soon realises, it was a trap. Who should then be Syria-bound but Ronnie -- it is a question of rescuing his brother, after all.

Quite simply, this is about Ronnie the one-man army taking on an entire nation's army. An overdone package of action unfolds through a screenplay that is barely there but has inexplicably needed multiple brains to be readied (Farhad Samji, Sparsh Khetarpal, Tasha Bhambra and Madhur Sharma).

The mayhem that unfolds is neither logical nor imaginatively executed, as Ronnie goes about snarling, frowning and mauling at anything and everything that comes in his way. The rampage looks dated -- it seems to bear the hangover of a zillion action films of the past decades. It is also absurd, you realise, as Ronnie virtually takes on an entire nation singlehandedly to save his brother.

Of course, there are the twists. But somehow these seem inadequate in setting up a thriller quotient.

This isn't a film you would go in expecting much of acting prowess on Tiger's part, and he doesn't try. Rather, his focus is clearly on the stunt-and-dance drill. After all, those are what his fans would go in to watch. On those counts, Tiger does not disappoint.

All other characters apart from Ronnie, including Riteish Deshmukh's Vikram and 'heroine' Shraddha Kapoor, are necessary props, rendered half-baked by weak writing.

""Baaghi 3"" tries working as an old-school action fest and falters. The film was never meant to be original fare. This is a Tiger Shroff showcase strictly for his fans, a technically glossy package meant to cash in on his machismo and dancing groove.

240,06-3-20,"Apple to launch 12.9-inch iPad Pro, MacBooks by 2020 end","Apple is reportedly planning to launch a 12.9-inch iPad Pro and multiple notebook models with Mini-LED backlit displays by the end of 2020.

Known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also mentioned that the company was developing six products with Mini-LED displays for release by the end of 2021 -- 12.9-inch iPad Pro, 10.2-inch iPad, 7.9-inch iPad mini, 27-inch iMac Pro, 14-inch MacBook Pro and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, Mac Rumors reported on Thursday.

The report claimed that the iPhone maker would also adopt Mini-LED backlighting for ""a few models of LCD monitors"", but it was unclear if that referred to the iMac/iMac Pro or standalone displays.

Earlier, Kuo had revealed that the iPhone maker was expected to release new iPad Pro models with rear 3D sensing in the first half of 2020.

Kuo in a research note with TF International Securities said the iPad Pro models will gain 3D sensing through the rear-facing camera system.

Apple is expected to use a time-of-flight system, which measures the time that it takes for light to bounce off of objects in a room to generate a 3D map.

Meanwhile, the upcoming MacBook may be a 5G-enable MacBook models in the second half of 2020.

The Cupertino-based company is reportedly considering using a ceramic material for the 5G antenna board in its upcoming MacBook, although they cost six times more than metal ones. This would dramatically improve cellular reception and transmission speed.
