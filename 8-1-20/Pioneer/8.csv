0,08-1-20,All eyes on Delhi durbar,"Will AAP be able to retain its novelty factor? Does the BJP need to reinvent its campaign pitch?

Now that the Delhi elections have been announced, coming as they do bang in the middle of a student-led churning in India against the status quo of habit in politics, the focus is on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). This is its litmus test as it did stir up the political process when its leaders began the transformation story with “India Against Corruption,” drew in civil society and students, attempted a pan-India blitz, even nudged in an alternative narrative but failed to make a big splash nationally. But it still got Delhi and learnt tough lessons from its missteps — being deserted by its acolytes with higher ambitions, repeating the mistakes of the Indian politician’s playbook, blaming the Centre for vindictive power plays, even earning the ire of voters who thought that they had been short-changed. Yet AAP won the war of perception by delivering the toughest part of governance. That’s performance. This is its only credo and novelty. This election will prove whether that can be pro-incumbency in a highly polarised context. There can be no doubt that it has shown incremental success in converting the old rhetoric of bijli, sadak and paani of its predecessors into the Delhiite’s new aspiration. Power reforms were the reason the Congress, then led by Sheila Dikshit, got mass acceptability between 1998 and 2013. The focus was on improving the quality of power supply through privatisation of the electricity distribution sector. And when that frayed at the edges, the mess was a fertile ground for the AAP to emerge as a champion of people’s right to a good life. It questioned the privatisation model, alleging financial irregularities by distribution companies to inflate tariffs at public expense. The reduced power bills will top AAP’s performance sheet. Or free water within consumption limits. It has set the nation’s agenda in education reforms by allocating 26 per cent of the Budget to education, upgrading standards and performance of Government schools and introducing the “happiness curriculum.” The mohalla clinics have revolutionised health delivery modules, the night shelters have eased the woes of the homeless and doorstep delivery of services have endured with the citizenry. And while the Urban Development Ministry has now approved regularisation of unauthorised colonies, the AAP Government has to be credited for making it inevitable by upgrading their infrastructure. Of course, it has been socialist to consolidate its votebank but it has already talked about decongesting and redesigning road infrastructure and launched free wi-fi to appeal to urban sensibilities. Some PWD projects are almost complete. Many observers had thought that the tidal personality cult of Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha elections last May, which swamped every Opposition leader, including Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and pushed back AAP to third place in voting percentage, would be the end. But Kejriwal was quick to seize the trade winds, stopped blame games or even talking about Modi and steered clear of lambasting Hindutva. Instead, he’s been seeking votes on the basis of his performance, asking people not to vote if they don’t like his work and emphasising he was only concerned about Delhi and not the nation. This self-deprecatory and localised, neighbourhood approach has foxed the BJP.

Lack of State leadership is the BJP’s Achilles’ heel, besieged as it is with faction fights. It suddenly finds itself without a credible counter-narrative on deliverables as it has predictably pitched its campaign on Modi’s personality and its hyper-nationalist agenda. With Kejriwal choosing not to fall for the BJP’s tested provocation on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the students’ protests, the lofty vision of a Ramrajya would fall flat without an alternative Delhi development plan. In fact, the BJP’s aggressive adversarial pitch and “everybody hates Modi” plan have fallen flat with Kejriwal choosing to disengage from any area that crosses paths with the Centre, even full Statehood and police, and sticking to his territorial limits. The problem is the BJP has misread Delhi as a barometer of the national pulse without realising that its people are the most vote-conscious, their loyalty pledged only to whoever has the better Excel sheet. That’s why its candidate Kiran Bedi lost to Kejriwal in 2015 despite the break-up between the Congress and AAP. Besides, AAP has cultivated caste/regional groups like Purvanchalis, Jats and Uttarakhandis and women, something that both the BJP and the Congress haven’t been able to harmonise. The Congress has lost the gameplan after Dikshit’s death and may not even be a vote-cutter but push the elections to a bipolar duel. February 11 will tell us what won hearts in the end.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/all-eyes-on-delhi-durbar-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/all-eyes-on-delhi-durbar.html
1,08-1-20,Doctors’ oath,"As doctors were stopped from treating injured JNU students, IMA asks if we are in a civil war

The Indian Medical Association (IMA), which has always been adamant about staying away from politics simply because it should not colour the way doctors react and treat their patients, has come out against the violence at JNU in strong terms. Questioning the “New Truth in India” as AIIMS doctors and nurses were stopped by goons from attending to injured students, it has asked, “How does it reflect on the nation, if it cannot protect its doctors and nurses reaching out to the injured? Is this a civil war? What is the message that goes out to the nation?” The IMA has clearly decided not to be a silent majority and speak out as a responsible community. This is the same IMA, which in August 2019, had accused the medical journal, The Lancet, of committing a “breach of propriety” while commenting on “a political issue,” when it slammed the Narendra Modi-led Government for its clampdown in Kashmir. But now that doctors, too, are at the receiving end of a police State, it is bent on upholding the Hippocratic oath, one which binds them to the business of saving lives, even of the enemy’s. The IMA had even questioned police action inside hospitals on December 22, during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, calling the crackdown “a new low in the civic life of the nation.”

So does the medical body’s slow change of stance mean that realisation is slowly dawning in civil society that we have to speak and stand up against the acts of subversion of democracy that we are witnessing in our lifetime? Perhaps, the IMA change in stance has been influenced by the fact that junior doctors in premier institutes like AIIMS have also participated in protests and solidarity marches against the CAA. Perhaps, it has woken up to the need for addressing the students’ angst and concerns as citizens and not shoving them under the carpet. This is in sharp contrast to the JNU administration, which is yet to take any step to engage with protesting students. No arrests have been made. Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar is at best indifferent to the plight of those under his care and has not visited the injured faculty members and students. Neither has any police officer been sacked for inaction, nor has any probe been initiated against the cops’ partisan role during the violence and claims by a fringe Hindu group, the Hindu Raksha Dal, that it was responsible for the mayhem in JNU. The country cannot afford to be dumbed down anymore.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/doctors----oath-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/doctors----oath.html
2,08-1-20,"Foster debate, not violence","The hooligans who vandalised JNU must be arrested. This might give some kind of closure to aggrieved students. But we need to rekindle the culture of debate and dialogue

As one gets down to write about one of the most disturbing episodes in the history of university politics in independent India, it becomes difficult to aim for balance. When bloodied faces of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) girls and menacing images of masked mobs brandishing hammers, machetes, iron rods and sticks flash across one’s mind, how does one show restraint in expressions?

It is possible that a few readers might misconstrue my opening observation as a clever but pliant pretext to dodge public condemnation of the attack on JNU. Some might even argue that if I were to write anything other than a spirited declamation of the State and the JNU administration, I would be doing the institution a great disservice. However, if no denunciation of violence is sufficient — and the horror of it cannot be summarised in language — must public intellectuals be endlessly polemical in their writings and speeches? Ever since the JNU crisis escalated, we have been swarmed with accusatory articles of two varieties: One that calls for clampdown on “urban Naxals” and the “tukde tukde” gang, that allegedly thrive is JNU’s subsidised campus, and a second that accuses a State-corporate nexus of attempting to privatise higher education and muzzle voices. I feel emboldened to argue that it is precisely this practice of using public forums to launch no-holds-barred assaults on adversarial viewpoints that has aggravated the crisis. This may not be the occasion to philosophise but to me, the sight of masked-assailants targetting political adversaries suggests a heightened state of intolerance and a complete refusal to communicate.

Simmering intolerance: As has been repeatedly pointed out, the crisis in JNU, to a great extent, is a fallout of a hostile rhetoric that has been doing the rounds on news channels and social media. The nature of this rhetoric is such that it refuses to allow even the slightest concession to its opponent. It is, therefore, no surprise that over the last few years, even as India kept debating “intolerance”, tolerance has been the greatest casualty. For months on end, agitated citizens tuned in to news debates, hoping to find answers to issues that had suddenly come to seize the public sphere. But the domineering news anchors and the blaring experts offered precious little other than orchestrated shouting duels. For a sizeable segment in India, which includes students, shopkeepers and senior citizens, such inflammatory debates, accessed through TVs and smartphones, provide an escape from the monotony of their placid lives. To argue after Professor Craig Jeffrey, this has been our “national timepass” or the politics of waiting in India. It is, therefore, all the more important that on a day such as this, we refrain from indulging in competitive intolerance or freestyle rhetoric.

While it is indeed a painful truth that balanced attempts at seeing the other side in contentious debates are socially not so rewarding but given the circumstance, it has become imperative. Occasional self-criticism, reflection and survey of the socio-political trends, which have dragged us to this point, will, perhaps, throw up strategies to escape this quagmire.

Breakdown of communication: Let us also admit that over the past two decades, in spite of the giant strides that we have taken in the field of mass communication, our ability to communicate has diminished significantly. If intolerant rhetoric is public enemy number one, breakdown of communication occupies the second spot. Further, those little conversations that we manage to have with our adversaries are so toxic that they end up pushing us in back into our respective cocoons, instead of helping us crawl out of them. As we debate, we interrupt, hoot, caricature, abuse and threaten.

In Think Again: How to reason and argue, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong argues that these days, people do not have close friends with radically different political views. It is indeed true that today, the majority prefers to live in communities, both real and virtual that are similar with respect to religion, politics, news sources and even social media networks. Moreover, if at all we encounter people with views hostile to our own, we avoid interacting with them. Consequently, the ideological schisms that divide us have widened more than ever. The world, including India, has transformed into a parliament of ideas with little possibility of syncretic exchanges and every chance of violent confrontations.

If you ever speak to the JNU alumni, you will find that the stories of campus camaraderie that cut across political ideologies and all other affiliations are aplenty. Most will admit that while the campus debates were always intense, they never even bordered on hatred, let alone violence. However, of late, things have taken a rather unfortunate turn. Shortly after the violence on January 5, a friend from JNU posted something to the effect that hereafter she would banish all BJP/RSS sympathisers from her life and that she would never ever interact with any of them or engage them in debates. If dialogue is not the way forward, how then do we propose to take things further and resolve the crisis?

Beyond JNU: This breakdown of communication inside the campus is matched by a similar disruption of communication with the world beyond. People outside the campus, even academicians based in prominent regional centres, are upset because media houses and activists have persistently refused to engage with the plight of universities beyond Delhi. For anyone, who has studied at provincial universities, scenes such as those witnessed by JNU on January 5 are commonplace. The present outcry over JNU, which is being projected as the last citadel of knowledge and democratic values in India, tends to overlook this reality. While the slightest suggestion of State intervention in Delhi-based institutions provokes massive outpouring of grief and indignation in certain sections of media, activists from Delhi had turned a blind eye when universities across India were being systematically dismantled. And those responsible for destruction of the likes of Patna University, Allahabad University and Lucknow University, among others, were socialists and the self-proclaimed followers of Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan (JP). According to Andre Beteille, the JP Movement did not lead to any significant moral cleansing of the students.

Student politics today: In 1970, writing on university politics in India, PG Altbach dismissed student activism as a spent force. He felt that it had lost its pre-independence idealism and sense of purpose. Although Altbach was proven wrong by the JP Movement, yet it is fair to argue that the months preceding Emergency saw the last major show of student unity. Since then, these movements have been spontaneous, sporadic and mostly disjointed. This can be attributed to a number of factors. First, owing to the expansion of institutions of higher education, the student population has become much more heterogeneous than earlier. Second, emphasis on commerce and technical education, as opposed to liberal arts and social sciences, has rendered them largely indifferent to socio-political issues. Third, our public institutions, such as the Parliament and judiciary, have become much stronger than earlier. Fourth, the extent and practice of students activism is not the same everywhere. Those based in metropolitan centres are more aware of politics and, therefore, more prone to activism. This difference has been further sharpened by an ever-widening rural-urban divide. Fifth, to most onlookers, student politics is a waste of time, resources and a breeding ground for corrupt politicians of the future. It is no surprise that calls for banning campus politics have become so ubiquitous in public discourses. Given the glorious legacy of student politics in India, this is highly undesirable. However, under the changed circumstances, some initiation in campus behaviour, culture and political socialisation should be made a part of orientation programme.

The hooligans, who vandalised JNU, must be arrested. This might give some kind of closure to the aggrieved students. But we need to rekindle the culture of debate, dialogue and cordial disagreement too.

3,08-1-20,There’s nothing anti-Hindu in it,"Faiz’s poem Hum Dekhenge that attacks oppression was written in the times of martial law in Pakistan. IIT-Kanpur’s administration should have known that

The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur has set up a panel to consider whether the poem Hum Dekhenge by the famous Urdu poet Faiz is anti-Hindu. This followed the recitation of the poem by students of IIT-Kanpur on December 17, 2019, on their campus during a gathering in support of the students of Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi, who were assaulted by the police during their anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) agitation. One need not go into the inanity of such a step by the IIT authorities who seem to have no understanding of Urdu poetry or of this particular poem.

No poetry in England, America, France, Germany, Russia and in any language, whether it is English, German, Hindi, Sanskrit, Bangla, Tamil and so on, in fact, no poetry in the world, expresses the voice of the human heart in such a powerful and yet elegant manner (andaaz-e-bayaan) as Urdu poetry does.

Mirza Ghalib is regarded by many as the greatest Urdu poet of all times and Faiz the greatest Urdu poet of the 20th century. I had the privilege of meeting Faiz once when he visited my hometown Allahabad in 1981 and was honoured at a massive function on the Allahabad University’s lawns.

Urdu poets often express their thoughts not in direct language but indirectly, through hints and allusions. Urdu shers (couplets) often have a literal, superficial meaning but they also have a deeper, real meaning which is conveyed by indication, suggestion and metaphors. It is this deeper, real meaning which the poet is seeking to convey. But to understand it, one has to ponder deeply and apply one’s brains to understand what the poet is trying to say. This is particularly done by poets in times when it may be dangerous to talk directly, such as during martial law. It was during this time that Faiz’s poem Hum Dekhenge was written.

Take for instance Faiz’ sher: “Gulon mein rang bhare baad-e-naubahaar chale. Chale bhi ao ki gulshan ka kaarobaar chale.” Now the literal meaning of this couplet is: “Among the colourful flowers, the new spring breeze is blowing. Come, so that the work of the garden can be done.” But that is only the superficial meaning of the couplet. The word “gulshan” literally means garden but here it means the nation. So, the real meaning of the sher which the poet is conveying is this: “The objective conditions in the country are ripe. Come forward patriots, the country needs you (for a revolution).”

Similarly, when we read Urdu poetry we must rack our brains and try to understand what it is really that the post is seeking to convey. Coming now to Faiz’s poem Hum Dekhenge one must remember it was written during General Zia-ul-Haq’s oppressive martial law regime when it was dangerous to talk directly. So part of the poem uses traditional Islamic imagery. However, it is used to attack Zia’s dictatorship and restore democracy, not for establishing orthodox Islam. The poem was sung by Iqbal Bano, deliberately wearing a sari (regarded by some as an Indian and unislamic dress for Pakistani women), despite the ban on public recitation of Faiz’s poems at that time. In fact, Iqbal Bano was later banned from singing anywhere in Pakistan. Many from the audience were rounded up, grilled and detained.

Some of the lines of the poem which are now being described as anti-Hindu are: “Jab arz-e-khuda ke kaabe se sab but uthwaaye jaayenge. Hum ahl-e-safa mardood-e-haram masnad par baithaye jaayenge.” The literal meaning of this couplet is, “When from the abode of God (Kaaba) all icons will be removed. Then, we the faithful, who were debarred from sacred places, will be placed on the royal throne.” It is alleged that these lines are anti-Hindu as Hindus worship idols, and these lines are clearly against idol worship. But this is only a superficial understanding. What it means is that self-styled icons of power will be thrown out and God’s beloved or common people will rule. Faiz was a life-long communist and he could hardly have meant that he wanted Islamisation of society. In fact, it was his antagonist General Zia who wanted Islamisation. To understand these lines we must see the context and also see the couplets preceding and succeeding them.

Before these lines, the verses in the poem are: “Jab zulm-e-sitam ke koh-e-giraan, rui ke tarah udh jaayenge. Hum mehkoomon ke paaon tale, yeh dharti dhad dhad dhadkegi. (When these high mountains of tyranny and oppression turn to fluff and evaporate. And we oppressed, beneath our feet will have this earth shiver, shake and beat.)” The succeeding lines are: “Sab taaj uchaale jaayenge, sab takht giraaye jaayenge. (When crowns will be thrown off and overturned will be thrones.”

It is obvious from this that there is nothing anti-Hindu in this poem and it is the height of absurdity to regard it so. It is a poem powerfully attacking the oppressors of the people and expressing a conviction that one day the oppressed will become the rulers of their own destiny as has been promised to the people. The administration of IIT, Kanpur, which is otherwise a reputed institution, has made itself a laughing stock before the whole country by setting up a panel to review if the poem is anti-Hindu or not.

4,08-1-20,Population explosion must be next target,"Prime Minister Modi should not only mobilise the support of other political parties but also of the chief ministers. If India wants to be a superpower, then addressing the population explosion is imperative

Will there be a move to contain the population explosion in the country? After Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort that “keeping one’s family small is an act of patriotism” hinting at some measures to contain the population, there were expectations that a Bill might be introduced in this regard in the upcoming Budget Session.

Addressing the issue for the first time in his Independence Day speech, Modi expressed concern over the steep rise in India’s population and said that the Centre and States should look at measures to deal with it. “The time has now come that we should take such challenges head on,” he announced from the ramparts of the historic fort.

Currently, the population of India is at 1.37 billion and will overtake that of China, the world’s most populous country by 2027. However, millions still do not have access to clean water, food, healthcare and education, thanks to the unmanageable numbers. Plus, more mouths mean more strain on the resources.

However, now that there are pan-India protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), it is doubtful whether the Prime Minister would open up one more front. Just as the CAA and NRC are perceived to be targetting the Muslims in the country, this too will be seen as an attempt to target the biggest minority community in India. In any case, the “P-word” is a very sensitive subject and no politician wants to touch it after the forced sterilisation drives during the Emergency. It became an election issue and Indira Gandhi lost that election.

The Union Health Ministry even changed the name of the Family Planning Department to Family Welfare Department. Moreover when even China, known for its rigid family planning programmes has opted for an overhaul of its earlier one-child norm, why should India be pushing for family planning programmes?

Besides, the Economic Survey 2018-2019 says, “India is set to witness a sharp slowdown in population growth in the next two decades. Population in the 0-19 age bracket has already peaked due to a sharp decline in total fertility rates (TFR) across the country.” Nine States have already reached the replacement rate of 2.1 or below. All of India will have reached a TFR of 2.1 or below by 2021. Almost all major States, including even populous ones like Haryana and Bihar, are said to have experienced a significant deceleration in population growth. High fertility rates persist in 72 districts, a little over 11 per cent of the country’s 621 districts. Although India’s population continues to grow, the pace of net addition is decreasing.

The southern States have genuine concern as they have sought a negative growth and are consequently at a disadvantage, as when delimitation takes place or when the Finance Commission allocates resources, one of the criteria is population. The five southern States even held a conclave to project their problems. So special incentives should be given to the States that adopt a negative population growth target.

Those who are against any harsh measures to contain population argue that the one billion plus population would yield a demographic dividend. For poor families, more hands mean more income. Also, it has brought in higher per capita entitlements. Second, the migration from the north and the eastern States has helped maintain growth in the South and the West, where fertility rates are low.

However, Rakesh Sinha, a nominated Rajya Sabha member has tabled a Private Member’s Bill called The Population Regulation Bill, 2019, in the Upper House, which he hopes might be taken up in the upcoming Budget Session. The Bill advocates penalties ranging from denial of financial benefits to ineligibility for elected offices and discontinuation of food subsidy and other such things. There are also incentives for those who undergo sterilisation after having two children. The financial memorandum of the Bill estimates Rs 10 crore as annual recurring expenditure. Last year 125 parliamentarians submitted a petition to the President to implement a two-child norm. If the Bill gets support, then the Government could adopt it with some amendments. However, while the BJP might support the Bill, hoping that it will consolidate the Hindu votes, the secular parties would not go along with it because of their own vote bank politics, as they believe that the measure is to target Muslims. But in view of the brute majority of the BJP in the Lok Sabha this measure could be pushed through.

Containing the population explosion is imperative and every citizen has a stake in it. It is not enough just to provide contraceptives to women to enhance demographic transition; it should be accompanied by awareness, availability of food, employment and healthcare. Overpopulation is a huge problem that India is grappling with for long. Political compulsions and vote bank politics have so far deterred our Prime Ministers from taking up the issue. It is a good sign now that Modi is willing to change the narrative.

He should not only mobilise the support of other political parties but also of the chief ministers. If India wants to be a superpower, then addressing the population explosion is imperative.

5,08-1-20,No extension in reservation for Anglo Indians,"The 126th amendment of the constitution provides for extending reservation for SC and ST in the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas for a period of further 10 years, but makes no mention of the reservation for the Anglo Indian community.

It effectively means that with the passage of the bill, the reservation for this community would be a thing of past. In Uttarakhand, 70 members are elected while one member of Anglo Indian community is nominated in the assembly.The reservation was granted for Anglo Indian community for a time period of 70 years in the year 1950.

The term of this reservation is ending on January 25, 2020. However the tenure of the lone MLA of the Anglo Indian community, George Ivon Gregory Mann would end in 2022.

The Anglo Indian community is represented by the progeny of the Europeans who had married Indian women during the British period. The officiating parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik said that the population of Anglo Indian community in the country is only 295 and two MPs and nine MLAs are nominated from among the members of this community.

He accepted that with passage of the bill, the benefit of reservation for Anglo Indians would cease to exit. Meanwhile opposition Congress has decided to oppose removal of reservation to the community. The Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) President and Chakrata MLA, Pritam Singh said that the ending reservation for Anglo Indian community is an injustice and Congress would oppose it.

He said that the Anglo Indian MLA, Gregory Mann has decided to bring an amendment in the bill. However Mann could not be contacted for confirmation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-extension-in-reservation-for-anglo-indians.html
6,08-1-20,UP govt hikes travel allowances of class III employees,"In a new year gift to state employees, the Yogi government announced a hike in the travel allowances of class III workers and sanctioned funds for the zoological park to come up in Gorakhpur. The government also announced construction of a hostel at Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow.

The decisions were taken on Tuesday in a cabinet meeting which was chaired by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Government spokesperson and Power Minister Shrikant Sharma said the government had decided to hike travel allowances of around 1.5 lakh state employees, including lekhpals and health & forest employees.

The employees getting Rs 100 will now receive Rs 200 as travel allowance. Similarly, the travel allowance of Rs 200 has been increased to Rs 300 and those who were getting Rs 300 will now get Rs 450. The employees receiving Rs 400 will now get Rs 600 as travel allowance.

Sharma said that with the hike, the state government will have to bear an additional financial burden of Rs 20 crore annually. The hikes travel allowance will be given with retrospective effect from November 1

In another decision, the cabinet approved amendment to the excise policy for issuing licences for bhang shops. Now, there will be a lottery system and online application for allotment of bhang shops from the next fiscal, whereas earlier, it was through tender and auction.

The government also approved a sum of Rs 234.36 crore for completion of Shahid Ashfaq Ullah Khan Zoo in Gorakhpur, which is being constructed in an area 121.34 acres. The zoo, which has been under construction since 2008-09, is expected to give a boost tourism and generate employment opportunities in the region. After Lucknow and Kanpur, it will be the third zoo in the state.

The cabinet also approved construction of a 200-bed hostel for students of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) in Lucknow at a cost of Rs 12.15 crore. Presently, there is only a 60-bed hostel in the medical institute.

The government also approved a proposal to change the name of UP Jagat Guru Rambhadracharya Viklang University to UP Jagat Guru Rambhadracharya Divyang University with changing the nodal department from IT and Electronic to Divyang.

The divyang university has also been permitted to seek government grant. The government also allowed demolition the building of Kotwa Primary Health Centre, which has now been converted into the community health centre in Bahadurpur area of Prayagraj district. The government will collect Rs 27.86 lakh from the debris of the demolished building.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-hikes-travel--allowances-of--class-iii-employees.html
7,08-1-20,Blowing in the wind,"Wind energy can not only help achieve a sustainable future but also meet economic and social objectives. India must make the best use of this opportunity

India has ambitious plans for investing in wind power. A recent news report indicated that the Government announced its aim to set up 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030. This, it was indicated, would substantially reshape the global energy market dynamism and support the background of current plans to install 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, of which 60 GW would come from wind.

Currently, the largest capacity in wind energy is installed in China with a surprising second place being achieved by the US. Interestingly, the State of Texas, which has been a pioneer in the development of hydrocarbon resources and supply, is today leading all the States of the US in terms of wind energy capacity. This is clearly a reflection of the economic attraction of tapping wind energy in a State where oil and gas have been in favour for many decades now. The third place among countries with wind energy capacity is occupied by Germany and India follows in the fourth place.

It is particularly significant that Denmark is the leader in wind energy innovation and has been harnessing to a remarkable extent the potential that exists in that country. In this respect, perhaps, Denmark features as the first country to develop and implement a strategy for building an energy system independent of fossil fuels. This renewable form of energy already accounts for more than one-third of the total electricity consumption in Denmark. What is particularly significant is that wind power has been integrated with the rest of the energy supply system.

It is anticipated that by 2021, Denmark would be able to achieve 60 per cent of the wind energy supply as part of its total energy from all sources. Denmark’s achievement has been the result of vision on the part of the Government, widespread public support as well as collaboration across various industries. For instance, the Energy Innovation Cluster is Denmark’s cluster organisation and a network for innovation related to energy production. It facilitates collaboration among companies and sources of knowledge, such that the country uses the latest technology and creates innovative solutions that help society at large. Can India achieve a similar place in the world on technologies, which would define the future of human activities?

Recently, the world’s largest floating wind turbine began generating power off the coast of Portugal. This involves connecting the first of three 8.4 megawatt (MW) turbines. The project itself is connected to a substation in Portugal through a 12-mile cable, which is secured with chains to the sea bed 100 metre below. The benefit of a floating offshore installation such as this is that wind speeds are generally much higher in those locations which are a distance away from the coastline and the cost of a floating installation eliminates the need for anchoring the wind energy platform to the bottom of the sea. The prospect is that perhaps more than a dozen additional floating offshore wind projects may be commissioned in Europe by 2022, even though there are some concerns about overestimating wind farm capacity offshore.

The developments in wind energy technology bring out the power of innovation and the underlying direction that visionary management and Government policies can provide. It was decades ago that as the Minister of External Affairs, Dinesh Singh had asked this writer a question on what prospects exist for wind energy in our country. The Minister was apparently interested in wind as a source of energy and had possibly been reading some material on this subject.

A detailed assessment was carried out by this writer on the scanty information available on wind speeds in different parts of the country and a conclusion reached that wind energy probably had no potential in India given the unsuitable wind speeds and unsophisticated technology of the time. Indeed, for several years, wind energy developments made no sense for us but with the evolution of technology, particularly the economies of scale that were built into large-scale turbine units, the economics of wind energy technology has been completely transformed. Encouraged by the developments of the past three decades or so, this is an area where major developments should take place in the next 10 years or so worldwide and in India.

China recently confirmed plans to build the world’s biggest wind turbine. This innovation would be in collaboration between GE’s renewable energy division and a local organisation, which would establish the 12 MW offshore wind turbine in Guangdong province in China. Unfortunately, India has not yet taken the lead in coming up with innovations in this field, nor is there any evidence of indigenous manufacture of state-of-the-art technology. India has a coastline of over 7,500 kilometres and very favourable wind regimes in several offshore locations but mindsets continue to believe in expanding the use of fossil fuels.

Recent developments, with the US having targetted an Iranian General located in Baghdad, would lead to a hardening of global oil prices. There is a valid fear that any further escalation of conflict in the Middle-East could lead to further price increases, which would impact unfavourably on India’s already unsatisfactory rate of economic growth.

Earlier concerns related to energy security and the objectives of bringing about energy independence appear to have been given low priority as a result of a glut in the global oil market in recent years. At the same time, the negative externalities of coal production and consumption remain understated, with an expansion of supply, essentially to maintain coal as the major fuel for power generation in this country. There is a need, therefore, to articulate a long-term renewable energy strategy, which would also meet the objectives of the Government’s “Make in India” initiative. Wind energy developments will be an excellent candidate not only for India to achieve a sustainable energy scenario in the future but also as a means to meet a large range of economic and social objectives.

It is inevitable that the world would move away from fossil fuels largely for mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions, which are resulting in climate change world over. Hence, there would be a growing demand and a major market opportunity for nations, which innovate and produce equipment for harnessing renewable sources of energy. India has a growing opportunity to play a role in this market. It would be visionary on the part of the Government and the industry to treat this sector as a growing opportunity.

8,08-1-20,Singh: Akhilesh’s charges on JE-AES deaths baseless,"Alleging that the opposition, especially Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, was engaged in ‘spit and run’ by making unrealistic and fake charges against the ruling dispensation, the Yogi government claimed that Yadav’s charges on JE and AES deaths in Gorakhpur were baseless and sans basis.

“Akhilesh Yadav is projecting fake figures and trying to do politics over the deaths of children. After wild allegations against the government, he is now sending wrong information to the media too,” said government spokesperson and UP minister Sidharth Nath Singh.

Talking to reporters in Lucknow on Tuesday, Singh categorically claimed that between January and November last year, 229 cases of JE and 18 deaths were reported in the state. “Similarly, 2026 AES cases and around 100 deaths of children were reported this year,” he added.

“It seems that the former Chief Minister misread the figures and said 1,000 deaths occurred in the last one year, when it was around 100. He added an extra zero just to blame the government,” Singh said.

On Monday, Akhilesh had said at a press conference that the Yogi government was raking up the deaths of children in a hospital in Kota (Rajasthan) even when 1,000 children had died in Gorakhpur in 2019.

Singh further claimed that after BJP government came to power in 2017, JE was almost eradicated with a massive vaccination programme that covered 1.5 crore children in Purvanchal.

“Similarly, in AES, in which cleanliness is the only preventive measure, the government went for ODF in 38 districts and reached out to 66 lakh families in three phases under its Dastak programme to make people aware about cleanness, due to which around 70 to 80 per cent decline in AES cases was reported since 2016,” the minister claimed.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/singh--akhilesh---s-charges--on-je-aes-deaths-baseless.html

12,08-1-20,‘Organic farming can help preserve climate-resilient seeds',"A workshop on crop diversity and organic farming was held in Chandipur near Mitrapur under Nilagiri block on Sunday.

Internationally acclaimed environmentalist, promoter of organic farming and conservation of seed diversity Dr Vandana Shiva attending the event stressed on crop diversity, organic farming and conservation of indigenous seeds.

She lamented that in the greed for more production, farmers are destroying the indigenous seeds by using chemicals.

Organic farming should be system based rather than individual component based. It should have integrated land management system (forests, range lands,waste lands, rain-fed and irrigated lands), livestock and households. Thus, the organic farming would be pivotal in enhancing ecological integrity, a state which will lead to sustainability, Dr Shiva told.

Dr Shiva, who is founder of the Navdanya Trust, said Odisha had been a birth place of indica varieties of paddy seeds and lamented that most of them perished due to want of conservation and organic farming.

Prof Dr AK Panigrahi, an expert in organic agriculture, who is also associated with Navdanya Foundation, attended the workshop. He claimed once upon a time Odisha had about 25,000 varieties of paddy seeds but now hardly a few are available due to no conservations.

“In western Odisha one Kamala Pujari has about 200 varieties of paddy seeds and in Niali, one Natabar Sarangi has about 400 varieties of seeds,” Dr Panigrahi said, claiming that his seeds bank in Baleswar had 1,017 varieties of paddy seeds which were climate resilient.

FM University VC Prof Madhumita Das, Prof Bishnu Prasad Dash, Dr Rajashree Dutta and Kusum Panigrahi among others spoke.

Support system for organic farming should be promoted in place of subsidy. This support system should do the work of facilitating, disseminating and promoting organic agriculture systems in generic sense, the speakers advocated.

They further said that diverse use of seeds not only be adopted for paddy; also for vegetables and other indigenous creatures.

On the occasion, some local farmers were felicitated.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---organic-farming-can-help-preserve-climate-resilient-seeds-.html

16,08-1-20,Power employees to boycott work,"Power employees of the state will boycott work on Wednesday as part of a nationwide strike call given by trade unions.

Convener of Power Employees’ Joint Action Committee Shailendra Dube said in Lucknow that 10 central trade unions and several affiliates would join the strike which would affect services across the country. He said that more than 20 crore workers from all sectors, including banking, coal, oil, defence, public sector enterprises and transport, would join the general strike to oppose the government’s “anti-people and anti-worker policies”.

“We will not let the government forget workers’ issues, their jobs and livelihood. In the last six years, a ministerial group created to negotiate with trade unions on workers’ issues has only met them once, in 2015,” Dube said.

“Unemployment is at a 45-year high, farmers’ suicide continue unabated, hiring and firing is the new norm, small businesses are dying, economic growth is down in the dumps and consumer demand is low. Yet, the government is creating a narrative to make us believe that all is well. Workers will show their strength,” said the PEJAC leader.

“Workers’ unions have been making several demands, including Rs 21,000 minimum wage, higher basic pension for all, tripartite discussion on labour reform and a rollback of privatisation of profit-making public sector undertakings. Representatives of unions were invited by the Union Labour Minister for a meeting last week but it remained inconclusive,” Dube said.

“You will see farmers’ outfits, government scheme workers and informal workers’ groups on the streets with the same passion as industrial workers, who will stay away from work to join the protest,” Dube said.

About 60 student organisations and elected office-bearers of some universities have expressed solidarity with the workers and led the convergence of these issues with protests against a rise in fee structure and opposition to commercialisation of education, according to workers’ unions.

Dube further said that UP Power employees would not join the strike but would boycott work. “Employees engaged in thermal power generation stations and at 470kV and 765kV power transmission substations will not join the boycott as they have been exempted from it to prevent grid failure and causing inconvenience to the masses,” he said.

The PEJAC convenor said that power employees were opposing amendment to Indian Electricity Act, which provides for privatisation of power distribution across the country. The other demands of power employees is restoration of old pension scheme and restoration of UP State Electricity Board.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/power-employees--to-boycott-work.html
17,08-1-20,Sugar mills asked to clear arrears of cane farmers without further delay,"The UP government has asked private sugar mills to clear the arrears of cane farmers without further delay. While the current 2019-20 cane crushing season is underway, cane arrears to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore for 2018-19 season are still pending with sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh.

While private millers account for 85 per cent of the arrears, the bulk of arrears are owed by units operated by big players like Bajaj Hindustan, Modi and Simbhaoli groups.

As per official figures, private mills owe about Rs 1,700 crore of the Rs 2,000 crore arrears and government controlled cooperative units have an outstanding of nearly Rs 300 crore. Sugarcane Development and Sugar Industries Minister Suresh Rana said that UP mills had already settled 94 per cent of cane payables for the 2018-19 crushing season.

“We will convene a meeting with the management of defaulting mills, especially Bajaj Hindustan, Modi and Simbhaoli groups and ask them to clear their dues,” he said.

Last year, the Yogi government had filed criminal cases against several defaulting mills, including those owned by Bajaj Hindustan, Modi and Wave Groups. The FIRs were lodged under section 3/7 of Essential Commodities Act (ECA), 1955 and sections 420 and 120 (B) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Besides, recovery certificates (RCs) were also issued against a few others, which entitled the respective district administrations to seize movable and immovable properties, including sugar stock, for auction, so that liabilities could be settled.

Rana said that cane payments of more than Rs 80,000 crore had been made by sugar mills over the past 33 months of the current regime, which was unprecedented in the state and indicated the pro-farmer stance of Yogi government.

The minister said that 21 sugar mills were producing Ethanol with ‘B’ heavy molasses and going forward, the government was aimed at integrating all sugar factories with Ethanol production capacity to insulate the sector from cyclical nature of sugar industry and provide a viable economic value chain.

In 2018-19 crushing season, a total of 119 mills, including 94 private, 24 cooperatives and a UP State Sugar Corporation unit, participated in crushing and produced 11.8 MT of sugar as compared to over 12 MT in 2017-18.

However, India’s sugar bowl UP witnessed cane area shrinkage of more than 4% to 2.68 million hectares (MH) in 2019-20 crushing season from 2.8 MH in 2018-19.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sugar-mills-asked-to-clear-arrears-of-cane-farmers-without-further-delay.html

19,08-1-20,"Lie has no legs: PGV on release of Sadaf Jafar, Darapuri","Targeting the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party after the release of retired IPS officer SR Darapuri and Congress leader Sadaf Jafar on Tuesday, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said that a lie had no legs.

Ten persons, including Darapuri and Jafar, who were arrested and sent to jail following anti-CAA protests in Lucknow, were granted bail by a Lucknow court on Saturday. Their release was postponed to Tuesday for completion of formalities.

After their release, Priyanka tweeted: “Ambedkarite thinker and former IPS Mr Darapuri and Congress leader Sadaf Jafar were released from jail today. Upon being asked for evidence, UP Police could not prove anything.”

She further wrote: “The BJP government has shown its true thinking by arresting innocents and those who carry forward Baba Saheb’s legacy.”

Earlier on December 28, Priyanka had visited Darapuri’s family at their Indira Nagar residence in Lucknow. She was stopped by the police after which the Congress leader alleged that she was roughed up by cops. Later, she went to Polytechnic crossing on a scooty and walked to Darapuri’s residence.

On Saturday, a Lucknow court given the order of releasing 10 people, including Darapuri and Jafar, on bail on Saturday. The accused were asked to furnish two bail bonds worth Rs 50,000 each and personal bonds of equal amount.

Meawhile, after her release, Sadaf thanked Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for getting her thrashed by police and putting her behind the bars.

“All my fears of getting beaten up and going to jail have ended and now I will have the courage to counter this illegal law of CAA/NRC more forcefully. Today, I vow to continue my protest against the legislation till it is withdrawn,” Sadaf told mediapersons after stepping out of Lucknow jail.

A social activist, Sadaf accused the police of high-handedness during the arrest and said: “I was slapped by many and called Pakistani because of my religion. At night, I was told that a senior police officer wanted to meet me. I hoped that at least on humanitarian grounds and constitutional rights, my family would be informed of my whereabouts but when I went to meet him, I was abused.”

Speaking about her meeting with the police officer, Sadaf said that women cops assaulted and clawed her face.

“The officer asked the women cops to slap me but was not satisfied with the action. So, he pulled my hair and kicked me in my stomach and knees. They were wearing no badges to keep their identities under wraps,” she alleged.

Commenting on his arrest, Darapuri said the case against him was fake and the police had no evidence.

“I have worked as an officer in UP Police for 32 years and my task was to maintain law and order and not to instigate violence. I had no role in the violence in Lucknow on December 19, yet I was framed. On the day of violence, I was under house arrest and none of my social media posts could foment violence. I had appealed to people to protest peacefully and not indulge in violence. The violence was sponsored and jointly instigated by the RSS and BJP along with police,” the former IPS officer alleged.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lie-has-no-legs--pgv--on-release-of-sadaf--jafar--darapuri.html

21,08-1-20,Centre to fund bypass road to link Gopalpur,"In view of traffic remaining jammed most of the time on the road connecting the Gopalpur Port in Ganjam district, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has agreed to provide funds for construction of an alternative road (bypass) to ease the congestion.

With the Gopalpur Port becoming functional and vehicles moving in a big number, people are facing tough time on the National Higway-516 connecting the National Highway-16.

At a meeting held here recently, it was decided that the State Government would provide land for the alternative road and the Ministry funds. The decision has come as a great relief for the people who commute on the 5.35-km stretch of the NH-516 connecting NH-16 at Gopalpur.

The stretch also crosses railway line to the Indian Rare Earth at two different places.

While the MoRTH has sanctioned Rs 163.65 crore for construction of two road over-bridges (ROBs), work has not yet started. However, surveys said that the ROBs will not serve the purpose of easing congestion on the road and suggested for an alternative road of 4.5 km constructed from NH-16 at DRDA Office at Chhatrapur to Gopalpur Port.

The new alternate road would by-pass all the affected villages, and construction of ROBs would not be required, opined engineers.

22,08-1-20,Tradition-bound B'garh residents wow Kansa's laugh,"The 71st edition of the world famous Dhanu Yatra of Bargarh has started on December 31. The festival enacting a story of the killing of demon king Kansa will end on January 10.

As the story gets enacted in open-air theatre, the Bargarh town has virtually transformed into Mathuranagar, the capital of King Kansa while the nearby Ambapali village across the Jeera river has become Gopapura, the abode of Lord Krishna. Needless to say, now river Jeera is taken for granted as the Yamuna. Jeera flows between the Bargarh headquarters town and Ambapali.

During the festival, Maharaja Kansa rules the roost in the length and breadth of the town. He also issues orders at his camp courts and everybody bows to him and follows his orders without fail. There is no excuse for offence in Kansa Maharaja’s kingdom. Be it the district Collector or the SP or a layman, everyone has to obey Kansa even as the man who dons the attire of Kansa and utters words in a royal style like the mythical king is just an ordinary person.

The fun and frolic goes on in the biggest open air theater of the world nonstop for the whole length of the yatra speaking volumes as to how much tradition bound the denizens here are. Where the Kansa Maharaja moves on the elephants back, it turns into a pandal. It could be an open market, a jail or the national highway. The Maharaja takes stock of the situation of his Kingdom by moving from place to place.

From a resplendent pandal in the evening, the Maharaja asks the district officials to ensure smooth functioning of his kingdom and directs them to solve the problems of the residents.

The unique festival of Dhanu Yatra is celebrated after the harvesting season. The tired farmers get a lot of pleasure during the event. It is a rich and vibrant source of entertainment for the people of the locality and all others who visit the town.

The play enacted during the festival comprises three mythological episodes Krishna Leela, Mathura Bijaya and Kansa Baddha.

King Kansa, the maternal uncle of lord Krishna, invites Krishna and Balaram to witness and participate in the festivity which is held in his capital Mathura. Lord Krishna kills his tyrant uncle Kansa and liberates his subjects from his oppressive rule. The play ends with the death of Kansa. It is believed that the Dhanu Yatra in its present from started in 1948.

During the post-Independence period, the performance was charged with a nationalistic fervor. Kansa symbolized the imperialist British Government of its way out and Lord Krishna stood for the nationalistic aspiration of the people.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tradition-bound-b-garh-residents-wow-kansa-s-laugh.html

31,08-1-20,All pleadings failed Puri Mangu Mutt survival,"The climbing atop of five Nihang Sikhs on the demolished Mangu Mutt structure at Puri recently caused ripples in the administration. The January 2 is the birth anniversary of the tenth Sikh Guru Gobind Singh Ji, which is celebrated with fervour by the Sikhs.

The Nihangs climbed atop the demolished rooms of the mutt and retrieved the emblem of Sikhism, the Khanda, from the debris. The Khanda, a double edged sword, is the military emblem of the Sikhs. It is also part of the design of the Nishan Sahib, and is installed on the top as an ornament or finial. The finding of the Khanda in the ruins was proof enough that the Mangu mutt was once a Sikh Gurudwara.

After much cajoling and coaxing, the Nihangs were made to come down and were packed off to Bhubaneswar.

The mutt, an abiding symbol of the connection between Sikhism and the 12th century Jagannath Temple, is built on the spot where Guru Nanak, during a visit in 1506, had composed the Sikh Aarti. The Aarti is essentially Guru Nanak's tribute to the grandeur of the Creator, whose glory, he said in the spontaneous composition, could not be expressed through any human offerings or oblations. The mutt was located in front of the Singha Dwar, the main entrance and was within the 75-meter perimeter of the temple's boundary wall which was slated for clearance.

It was a sad day in the lives of conservationist-historian Anil Dhir and lawyer-activist Sukhvinder Kaur of the High Court of Orissa as they watched the demolition of the Mangu mutt. The five-month-long determined battle for the preservation of the mutt by Dhir and Kaur literally came to a grinding halt in the second week of December as the Government's demolition machinery swung into action. On their part, the duo left no stone unturned in averting the disaster. They knocked on every door possible; they appealed to the Prime Minister, the Chief Minister of Odisha, the State Governor, the Collector of Puri, the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), the Chief Minister of Punjab and the Odisha Sikh leadership. In September, after the intervention of the Punjab Chief Minister, the demolition order was temporarily withdrawn.

Ignoring the unbroken campaign for its conservation, in one heartless order, the Odisha Government destroyed 12, 000 sq ft of the mutt; now, only a 10x9 sq ft area of the original place remains, besides two half broken rooms.

Ironically, the mutt was demolished at a time when the Odisha Government was proposing to celebrate the 550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji at Puri. The celebrations were cancelled, and a small seminar was instead held at the Odisha State Archives in Bhubaneswar. Appeals against the demolition were also made in the social media, and Sikh activists had come all the way from Canada to appeal to the authorities to stop the demolition. In September this year, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh wrote to his Odisha counterpart against demolishing the shrine, but all of it fell on deaf ears. The contradictory statements made by the spokespersons of the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee and the Sikh Pratinidhi Board of Odisha did not help matters.

While the entire Sikh leadership of Punjab, cutting across party lines, opposed the demolition, the Odisha Sikh leaders toed the Government ’s line. They, like the State Government, maintain that only the unauthorised structures around the mutt have been erased. However, Dhir says, the shifting of the religious relics from the demolished parts proves that the original structure had been demolished, not just the commercial encroachments.

Post-demolition, a delegation of Sikh MLAs from Punjab met the Odisha CM and demanded that at least the demolished area be handed back to the community. They also held a protest march in Bhubaneswar in December end. However, no written assurance has been given about the transfer of land to the Sikhs and, according to Dhir, it may be a case of too little, too late.

The activists are now pinning their hopes on an intervention petition in the Supreme Court where a case against the demolition of two other mutts associated with Nanak's Puri visit, Punjabi Mutt and Bauli Sahib is due for hearing on January 8. Dhir, however, is of the view that unless the Sikh political and religious leadership comes forward forcefully, the other two shrines could also face the Odisha Government's axe, and that conservationists may be fighting a losing battle even in court.

32,08-1-20,State begins NPR update process,"The State Government has begun a process to update the National Population Register (NPR) with the launch of a pilot survey. A door-to-door survey would be conducted soon as part of the process, an official here said.

“As per instructions of the Registrar General of India, the NPR exercise has been initiated. A pilot survey has been carried out in parts of the State while a door-to-door survey and house-listing will be conducted in mid-April,” he further informed.

Amid fears that the exercise could be a precursor to National Register of Citizens (NRC) implementation, the Union Cabinet had last month given its go-ahead for Census 2021 and NPR updating while making it clear that the apprehensions were unfounded.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan, however, insisted that it was the “first step” towards NRC implementation.

Explaining the format, the Odisha official said the number of fields on the registration form has been increased and several questions rephrased. Unlike 2010, when the NPR was last updated, every applicant this time would have to furnish Aadhaar number, mobile number, voter ID and driving licence.

“In 2010, people were asked by NPR enumerators to provide names of father, mother and spouse, while also stating if they were alive. This time, people will have to provide date, place of birth of parents, mother tongue and other relevant details if born outside country,” he said.

Reiterating that the NPR and the NRC are not connected, BJP State vice-president Samir Mohanty on Tuesday said it is necessary to update the population register for proper distribution of welfare scheme benefits.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-begins-npr-update-process.html

35,08-1-20,Ayushman Bharat: State wants 2 changes,"The State Government is still awaiting the Union Government’s response to its conditions for implementation of the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat scheme.

According to Health and Family Welfare Minister Naba Kishore Das, the State Government has sought two changes in the provisions of the Ayushman Bharat scheme before implementing it.

Das said the State Government has proposed the Centre not to make Aadhaar card mandatory for the patients to undergo treatment at Government hospitals. However, the Aadhaar card can be made mandatory for private hospitals, he said.

He pointed out that the State has already implemented its own Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana (BSKY) much before the Centre launched its healthcare scheme. Under the BSKY, there is no provision of mandatory Aadhaar card for getting treatment.

Secondly, Das said the Centre has decided to cover 62 lakh beneficiaries under Ayushman Bharat for treatment at private hospitals, but the State Government has asked to raise it to 70 lakh.

The State Government has already appraised the Centre of its two conditions in a letter in September and then in December last year and is still waiting for its reply.

On the other hand, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has reportedly said, “There is no point in making unnecessary controversy over Ayushman Bharat. The State Government should implement it for the betterment of the needy people of Odisha.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ayushman-bharat--state-wants-2-changes.html

Nine projects would be undertaken as part of the package. Works on renovation of historic water tanks, modern parking, a Lingaraj Heritage Project, development of Kedar Gouri and Muketswara temple premises, e-auto programme and establishment of a heritage interpretation centre would be carried out.

38,08-1-20,Cinemas get multiplex status,"The Punjab Government on Tuesday unveiled amended people-friendly Punjab Municipal Building Bye Laws, plugging the deficiencies in the earlier provisions and seeking to give a boost to the sluggish construction and infrastructure development activity in the State.

The new bye laws, covering construction of residential, commercial and industrial buildings, including hotels, miniplexes and other infrastructure projects, are aimed at making construction activity in the state more seamless and hassle-free for all the stakeholders, thus reviving the sector in the state, according to Local Government Minister Brahm Mohindra.

Additional Chief Secretary Local Government Sanjay Kumar said that the bye laws had been notified by the Town Planning wing of the Local Government Department on December 31, 2019. Prominent amongst those present on the occasion were Media Advisor to CM Raveen Thukral, CM’s Principal Secreary Tejveer Singh, Special Principal Secretary to CM Gurkirat Kirpal Singh, Director Local Government Bhupinder Pal Singh and State Town Planner Kamal Preet Kaur.

As per the amended bye-laws, Cinemas would now be considered as Miniplexes, with their capacity enhanced to four from the earlier two, and the seats increased to 999 without any bar of minimum seats per cinema fixed at 250 earlier. For inviting investments in small ULBs, the frontage of the plot for miniplex has been reduced to accommodate the small plot sizes in Class I and II towns. Further, the owner/builder can now convert his existing Cimema to Miniplex with commercial component on 50 feet wide road too. Ground coverage of miniplex has also been increased.

Keeping vertical growth in consideration, the FAR of multiplexes have been increased on different sizes of roads. This will invite more Mega Projects in Punjab which will bring more investment and employment opportunities.

The Punjab Purchase of FAR has also been introduced in multiplexes on payment basis, along with Transferable Development Right to boost investment opportunities, for which the requisite terms and conditions of purchase of FAR have also been clearly defined in the amended bye-laws.

Further, the builders can build more flats leading to better return in their investment, which will not only attract more investments in Urban Punjab but also improve the financial condition of Urban Local Bodies while checking unauthorised constructions in such projects.

To encourage planned development and investment in urban Punjab, hotels, motels and guest houses have also been incorporated in the amended bye laws. In earlier bye laws, the minimum plot size for hotels was 1000 sq. mts but in thickly populated urban areas with mixed population strata there was need of economy/budget hotels near railway stations and bus stands. In such areas, only small size plots are available, therefore the plot size has been reduced from 1000 sq. yds to minimum of 200 sq. mts. The move will encourage tourism in heritage cities and business opportunities for industrial cities. Also, the norms of guest houses/ boarding and lodging/service apartments have been relaxed, which will result in similar advantages to hospitality sector as well as floating population.

The new bye laws also allow storage godowns to be constructed along with industrial units with rates at par with those units, which will help cater to the need of small scale storage for industrial as well as commercial units.

In earlier bye laws, minimum area of Industry was 360 sq. yds, which was not favorable for small scale hosiery units, cottage industry and other small units which otherwise contribute tremendously to the economy of the state. Such small scale industrial units operate from even small size plots of 50 sq. yds. Therefore, minimum plot size requirement fixed in previous bye laws has been omitted. This would facilitate unemployed youth from low income strata to engage in self-employment by starting small scale industrial units.

To boost Knitwear industry in Punjab, the height of Textile & Knitwear Industry and Information Technology industry buildings has been increased from 15 mt. to 21 mt. All these incentives would be instrumental in boosting industrial growth and allied employment opportunities.

To improve safety, Setbacks of Wholesale Trade/Ware House/Integrated Freight Complex have been fixed, while earlier there was no such limit.

Under the amended bye laws, medical colleges with Hospitals or Nursing colleges, hostels, etc. would be treated as Institutional Buildings. Ground coverage and FAR of such Medical -Institutional buildings, having area above 10 acres, has been increased for providing better medical facilities to the residents of state.

The restricted areas for building operations under different Acts were not mentioned in the bye laws earlier, but have now been included so as to help general masses ascertain the status of land before purchase.

The amended bye laws also regulate group housing, frontage of Group Housing plots now being fixed, and norms of public utilities and facilities also included. Commercial use has been relaxed in such projects, and now they can have opening on front roads subject to certain conditions. Crèche and Primary school have also been allowed in Group Housing projects for safety and convenience of children.

Size of balconies not to counted towards FAR has been increased from 1.2 meter to 1.8 meter, to make them more user friendly. This will be favourable to builders of group housing projects and ultimately benefit the residents of group housing.

The amended bye laws also provide for day care centres and play way schools in residential areas. Norms for Old Age Home/Care Centre for Differently Abled Persons / Mentally challenged/ Working Women/ Men Hostel/ Adult Education Centre/ Orphanage/ Children’s Centre/ Night Shelter, Religious Buildings and Anganwari have been introduced for providing better living environment.

In those cities where Master Plan has not been notified and there were no criteria of road width for commercial properties, the same has been fixed in the amended bye-laws.

The declared Core areas that exist from centuries have been exempted and road width has not been fixed for those areas.

Similarly, the areas which have been declared commercial in Master Plans have also been exempted. Small shop owners and applicants who want to construct shop/commercial establishments in such areas will be specially benefitted by this facility.

In earlier bye laws, road width for petrol pumps was fixed at 100 feet, which discouraged Petrol companies from providing new petrol pump facilities in urban Punjab. Small ULBs were specifically affected by this, as no road is generally 100 feet wide.

This has been reduced now to 60 feet to cater to the growing vehicular population.

For providing better and quality medical services, a slew of relaxations have been given to nursing homes and hospitals, which include 5% additional ground coverage for multi-level parking, with multi-level podium parking free from FAR and ground coverage allowed to facilitate ample parking in spaces.

Common areas such as waiting halls, reception and fire stairs cases shall be allowed free from FAR.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cinemas-get-multiplex-status.html

44,08-1-20,U’khand Assembly ratifies Constitution 126th Amendment Bill,"The Uttarakhand Assembly ratified the 126th amendment Bill-2019 of the Constitution in a special session on Tuesday. The amendment would pave the way for extending reservations for the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies of the States for a period of further 10 years.

Tabling the bill, the officiating parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik said that that although SC and STs have made considerable progress in last 70 years, the reasons which weighed with the constituent assembly in making provisions with regard to the aforesaid reservation of seats have not ceased to exit.

However during the debate on the bill, the government was left red-faced when the members of treasury benches raised questions on various aspects of reservation.

The BJP MLA from Badrinath Mahendra Bhatt created furore in the assembly when he said that in mountainous areas the members of SC community used to be well off.

He said that in last 70 years, the members of reserved categories have made considerable progress and now they should voluntarily leave this benefit. This statement of the MLA was objected by the Congress MLA, Mamta Rakesh.

She said that the statement reflects the mindset of the ruling dispensation. The agitated Congress members even marched to the well of the house.

The BJP MLA from Bageshwar, Chandan Ram Das created discomfiture for his Government when he cited a recruitment advertisement of tourism department in which only five posts were advertised. He said this was deliberately done as the state government has recently brought change in reservation roaster which has placed the SC candidate on sixth position. The Leader of Opposition (LoP) Indira Hridayesh and Chakrata MLA Pritam Singh said that the Congress party supports the extension in reservation to SC and ST but wants that the representation of Anglo Indian community should also be kept intact.

The lone nominated member, George Ivon Gregory Mann said that the representation of Anglo Indian community should be kept intact. The house later ratified the amendment bill.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/u---khand-assembly-ratifies-constitution-126th-amendment-bill.html

As soon as the House assembled on the day, the deputy leader of the Congress legislature party, Karan Mahra raised the issue of restoration of old pension scheme for the government employees. He wanted that the house should discuss the very important issue under the rule 310.

It infuriated the Congress MLAs who marched to the well of the house. The speaker then gave the direction that discussion on the issue under rule 58. Later initiating the debate, Mahra said that the employees and their unions are agitated on the new pension scheme and are on the verge of launching a massive stir.

He said that the new pension scheme started in the year 2004 has failed to meet the aspiration of the employees. Mahra said that the employees who are now retiring under the new pension scheme are finding they would get pensions as low as Rs 2000 to Rs 3000 per month.

He said that the Uttarakhand Government should restore the old pension scheme so that the future of State Government employees is not jeopardised.

The Congress MLAs Govind Singh Kunjwal and Harish Dhami also supported the demand of Mahra. In his response, Madan Kaushik reminded that the state implemented the new pension scheme when Congress Government was in power. He said that the decision was taken in view of fiscal requirements. The minister informed that 1.40 lakh employees in the state are covered under old pension scheme while 80000 employees are covered under new pension scheme and claimed that there is parity in payment of gratuity, leave encashment and other benefits between the beneficiaries of old and new pension scheme.

The house witnessed heated debate on the issue of shifting of NCC academy from Srikot village of Devprayag. Raising the issue, Chakrata MLA, Pritam Singh said that Congress Government planned to set up NCC academy to in Devprayag and the villagers of Srikot were ready to handover 200 nali land for the purpose but the BJP Government shifted the academy to Pauri.

46,08-1-20,Punjab CM expresses concern over Akal Takht jathedar's remarks,"Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday expressed deep concern over Akal Takht Acting Jathedar’s remarks that Sikhs were not safe even in India, and asked the Takht to put pressure on the Akalis to sever all ties with the ruling alliance at the Centre, which had been unable to ensure a sense of safety among the minorities in the country.

Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh, of the supreme temporal body of Sikhs, on Monday reportedly condemned the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib attack and the killing of a Sikh youth in Peshawar, saying, ""I do not feel Sikhs are safe anywhere. In India, Sikhs are being uprooted in Madhya Pradesh and in Shillong also, they are facing eviction. In Pakistan, Sikhs are also scared after the incidents of killing of a Sikh and Nankana Sahib (gurdwara)"".

Reacting to the remarks, Capt Amarinder asked the jathedar to pressure the Akalis to sever all ties with the ruling alliance at the Centre, which had been ""unable to ensure a sense of safety among the minorities in the country"".Capt Amarinder said he did not agree with Akal Takht jathedar's remarks. ""If the jathedar did feel that way, he should take up the matter with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and ask them to leave the BJP-led coalition government at the Centre, of which they are a part,"" the chief minister said.

In a statement, the Punjab chief minister said that unlike Pakistan, India had always taken pride in being a secular nation, with no discrimination on religious grounds. ""Any feeling among the Sikh community that they are not secure here is a matter of grave concern,"" he said.

In his remarks, the jathedar had also appealed to the Sikh community to come together so as to contain such attacks.

While in Madhya Pradesh, there were reports of some Sikh families being evicted from their houses in Sheopur district, in Meghalaya capital Shillong, the Sikh families were last year asked to prove they were settled legally, he said.

Capt Amarinder said, ""If Sikhs are feeling insecure in the country, as stated by the acting jathedar, then it is the dispensation at the Centre which is to blame"".

""Given that the Akalis claim to be the custodians of the Sikh religion, and the community, they should take a stand on the issue, and SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal should also ask his wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal to resign immediately as a Union Minister,"" the chief minister said.He said while some incidents here and there could not be construed to be a case of Sikhs not being safe in India, ""perception is as important as reality"".

""The Sikhs had lived through a very dark period in the 1980s and any feeling of being at the receiving end in any way would revive their sense of fear, which would be detrimental to the community''s interest, as well as that of the nation,"" the chief minister said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-cm-expresses-concern-over-akal-takht-jathedar-s-remarks.html

48,08-1-20,AAP to ‘gherao’ CM residence on Jan 10 to protest costly electricy,"Punjab President of AAP and MP, Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday said that the Aam Aadmi Party would now ‘gherao’ Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s residence in Chandigarh on January 10, against what he called as ""open loot of power in the state by the government-sponsored power mafia"".

The party had earlier planned to ‘gherao’ CM’s residence on January 7, which had to be deferred owing to inclement weather.

In a statement issued here, Mann questioned Capt. Amarinder as to why common consumer in the state was forced to pay between ` 9 to Rs 12 for domestic power which, he claimed, was much higher compared to other states even as Punjab produced own electricity.

Mann said that on the one hand, Punjab producing own electricity was selling electricity to consumers at an expensive rate, compared to other states in the country, on the other, the Kejriwal-led government in Delhi, which produced not even a single unit of power on its own, was providing cheapest electricity to the people there.

Pointing finger at Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, the AAP MP questioned as to why he was maintain a stoic silence over the power agreements now when in power, while being the most vocal against them (PPOs) sitting in the opposition during the previous Badal

regime.

Mann said that both the SAD-BJP and the Congress governments were responsible for the expensive power in the state, saying that the Congress government was a bigger defaulter than the Badals, as it had failed to auditing POWERCOM’s previous years’ accounts and scrapping the PPPs, as promised to the people before assuming power in 2017.

He blamed Captain Amarinder Singh for becoming strange bedfellows in the open ‘loot’ of power by electricity mafia on the lines of the Badals.

Mann further said that the party would lay siege on Chief Minister’s official residence in Chandigarh on January 10, against the steep power hike in electricity charges to press the government for reducing power tariff.

AAP TO EXTEND SUPPORT TO NATIONWIDE STRIKE TODAY

Mann said that the party would extend its wholehearted support to the nation-wide strike call given by various farmer organisations and traders bodies across the country against the Modi government’s anti-farmers and anti-labour policies.

The Punjab AAP chief said the party was opposed to the union government’s anti-labor reforms, privatisation of government and semi-government organizations, promoting contractual employment and outsourcing, asserting that the stir call given by the trade and peasants’ unions was against the Modi government's stubborn stance towards the farming fraternity by not allowing remunerative price for their crop yield by implementing the Swaminathan Commission’s recommendations.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-to----gherao----cm-residence-on-jan-10-to-protest-costly-electricy.html

52,08-1-20,House ratifies Bill to extend quota for SC,"The Himachal Pradesh Assembly in its special one-day session on Tuesday ratified the Bill that extends reservation for SCs and STs in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies by another 10 years.

The Constitution (126th) Amendment Bill had already been passed by Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on December 10 and 12, respectively. Later, it was sent to states for ratification as it requires the consent of at least 50 per cent of the State Assemblies before implementation.

Replying to the discussion on the ratification motion, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said all members of the House supported the Bill and there was no need to discuss various issues pertaining to history. ""If the Congress legislators say their party had done a lot for Dalits, they should also admit that Pakistan was also created by Congress,"" he said.

Referring to Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, the Chief Minister said he was not against the discussion on the issue but presumed that all the members would be in favour of the ratification, which was why he had fixed the meeting from 2 pm onwards.

Reacting to Congress MLA Asha Kumari, Thakur admitted that some discrimination against Dalits had existed not only in Chamba but in some other parts of the state as well. Dalits are still served food in separate queues in some parts, he opined. A lot of positive changes have taken place but more changes are required for bringing in equality, he added. Not only that, Dalits should have gone forward beyond the upper castes by now so that reservation would not have been required, he said.

Earlier, the Chief Minister moved the motion for ratification of the Bill after it was tabled by Assembly Secretary Yash Paul Sharma. Presenting the motion, Thakur said that the Constitution provides reservation for members of SC/ST communities in Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies of States. The provision was included for 70 years since the enactment of the Constitution on January 26, 1950. Hence, it is scheduled to expire on January 25, 2020. The Bill seeks to extend the reservation till January 25, 2030, he added.

Leader of Opposition Agnihotri supported the ratification motion but raised questions on the brief address by the Governor.

Supporting the Bill, the lone CPI(M) MLA Rakesh Singha said the country failed to provide justice to SCs and STs in the last 70 years, which was why it was required to extend reservation for them in Lok Sabha and state Assemblies.

Chintpurni BJP MLA Balbir Singh said Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was initially against reservation. However Congress MLA Ram Lal Thakur raised objection to Balbir's utterances and said the previous Congress Governments had done a lot for the upliftment of SC/STs.

Minister Saizal said he agreed with some Congress MLAs, who had stated that Dalits are not allowed to enter some temples in the state. He pointed out that he and Nachan MLA Vinod Kumar were not allowed to enter a temple adding that the society as a whole required to take steps to end this discrimination. The minister thanked the Sikh gurus for starting the langar system that ended the caste system.

Congress MLA Sukhvinder Sukhu said if the minister was not allowed to enter the temple, he was provided protection under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 formulated by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

To this, Saizal said that he wanted to bring to the House the reality outside and it should be taken in that sense only.

Even former Dalit ministers from the Congress would have been denied entry into some temples during the previous Congress regimes, he added.

Congress' Kumari pointed out that Punjab and Haryana Assemblies are holding their sessions for three days for ratification of the Bill. She called for the state Assembly''s special session to be extended for a longer period to discuss the Bill in detail.Agriculture Minister Ram Lal Markanda, MLAs Harshwardhan Chauhan, Hans Raj, Rakesh Pathania, Jagat Singh Negi and Nand Lal also spoke in support of the Bill's ratification.

The party, he said, will put forth demands of common Jharkhandis in the Assembly and ensure that justice is served to the villagers. “We respect the voters’ mandate in the 2019 elections. Our legislators will put forth the demands of common Jharkhandis in the Assembly and work for the holistic betterment of the State,” the former Deputy Chief Minister said.

Though it won only two seats, the party chief Sudesh Mahto managed to pull off a victory in Silli constituency after a series of losses since 2009.

Student union organisations expressed solidarity with the JNU students who were beaten by masked men carrying rods and sticks.

Unidentified men armed with stones and sticks barged into the JNU campus on Sunday evening targeting students and teachers alike. Following the attacks candlelight vigils and marches have been observed in many parts of the country.

“JNU is one of the few universities where Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has not won elections with an absolute majority.

The varsities where ABVP is present have a pleasant atmosphere. The universities where people with a communist mind set are active such incidents are more prevalent. The communists wish to come to power flashing weapons which is not possible in a democracy like India,” said Atal Pandey, member of State Executive Council ABVP Jharkhand.

The number of such people is more in JNU and hence incidents like this occur time and again.

In the latest incident students were not allowed to fill forms and those managed to do so were beaten, he said.

“About 100 ABVP supporters have decided to stage a protest against the same on Tuesday evening requesting the central government to look into this matter on urgent basis as the communists are saying that the masked men belonged to ABVP which is not true. Around 25 of our supporters have been badly injured in the incident and are presently hospitalized. ABVP students have been targeted on Sunday,” added Pandey.

President of Ranchi University Adavasi Chatra Snagh Snjay Mahli said that students have planned to stage protests to get a message across to the government that such incidents should be stopped at the earliest as it hampers the atmosphere of educational institutions.

“The incidents taking place in JNU have affected the students in Ranchi to a great extent as students don’t belong to a particular caste or religion. People at the Central government and all supporters of RSS are trying to remove all the students of the backward class and also deprive them of education which is their basic right. They intend to remove the universities and establish ‘gurukuls’. If this continues students will not be study which has created fear amongst them,” said Mahli.

Hundreds of former students associated with the JNU Alumni Jharkhand Association chapter also staged a protest at the Albert Ekka Chpowk on Tuesday.

Ex JNU student and spokesperson of Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee Dr M Tausif said, “The masked men attacked the students, teachers and employees of JNU on the cue of the home ministry, vice chancellor and the Delhi police. The government wants to suppress the students voice by sending goons. Since the BJP has come to power, educational institutions are being targeted.”

Social worker and former student of JNU Upendra Kumar said, “Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and other members of BJP have earlier said that they plan to shut down JNU. The police, administration and the vice chancellor are responsible for this incident.”

XISS Professor Himaduri Sinha said that incidents like this are not acceptable in any State and it is also worrying that the vice chancellor could not prevent it. “All problems can be sorted through a discussion. I am a student of IIT and I support the JNU community,” he said.

Former JNU student and XISS professor Anand Kumar said that targeting students is not right and the incident should be inspected so that the truth is revealed.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ranchi-students--alumni-protest-against-jnu-violence.html

111,08-1-20,Foreign tourists arrival increases in Chandigarh,"The City Beautiful has been witnessing an increase in foreign tourist arrivals since 2016 when the Capitol Complex got the UNESCO World Heritage status while the number of domestic tourists has remained more or less similar.

As per the data with the UT Tourism Department, 40280 foreign tourists have visited Chandigarh till November 2019 while the number of such tourists in 2018 was 39681.

“The number of foreign tourists visiting the city last year is likely to cross 44000. As per the data till November 2019, 40280 have visited various tourist spots in Chandigarh,” said an official of UT Tourism Department.

As per the past trends, more than 4000 foreign tourists visit the city every December.

In previous years, the number of foreign tourist arrivals was 32762 in 2017 and 31549 in 2016 in the city. Earlier, it was in 2013 that a maximum number of around 40000 foreign tourists had visited Chandigarh.

Apart from UNESCO World Heritage site-Capitol Complex, worldwide known-Rock Garden- and tourists spots like Rose Garden and Sukhna Lake, are also frequented by foreign tourists.

On the other hand, the number of domestic tourists has witnessed only a marginal increase over the years in the city. The statistics with the UT Tourism Department shows that 1437253 (14.3 lakh) domestic tourists were recorded till November 2019 while the number was 1538796 (15.3 lakh) in 2018.

“The data of December is yet to be compiled but the total number is likely to cross 15.3 lakh as more than 1 lakh domestic tourists visit the city in December every year,” the UT official said.

The number of domestic tourist arrivals stood at1425781 (14.2 lakh) in 2017.

Chandigarh is considered as the gateway to the famous locations to Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, owing to which, the tourist inflow has witnessed a rise in the recent past.

However, experts point that Chandigarh’s potential for tourism is much larger and the UT Administration needs to promote it aggressively as a niche destination for modern architecture and not only as the city of gardens or fairs and festivals.As per the UT’s data, more than 15500 tourists visited the Capitol Complex in 2019 while the number stood at 12836 in 2018.

118,08-1-20,Tiwari asks Shaheen Bagh protesters to end road blockade,"Urging the protesters holding demonstrations against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Shaheen Bagh area to end their road blockade, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari said they do not need to fear anything as CAA has nothing to do with any citizen of India, even if they are Muslims.

Addressing the media, he said ""I request those protesting at Shaheen Bagh and other places that if you are born here and are a citizen of India, you need not fear anything, but if you are not a citizen of India then you must catch the first train and leave (dheere se gaadi pakdo lo aur nikal lo),"".

Tiwari said on Tuesday said illegal immigrants cannot be allowed to hold protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which has nothing to do with bonafide citizens of the country.

The BJP president has been at the forefront demanding the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise in Delhi, alleging that illegal immigrants are involved in majority of crimes like snatchings and loot in the national Capital.

The protestors in Shaheen Bagh near Jamia Millia Islamia University, including women, have been camping in the area for nearly a month. As a result, the crucial Kalindi Kunj road linking south-east Delhi areas to Noida remains blocked.

The roadblock is posing hardships to motorists commuting between Delhi and Noida as there are heavy traffic jams at alternate roads including the DND flyover.

Delhi Traffic Police has been flashing alerts daily on its official twitter handle warning commuters about the closure of Road no 13A between Mathura Road and Kalindi Khunj for traffic movement, suggesting motorists to take the DND or Akshardham road to commute between Delhi and Noida.

Tiwari said the BJP and its government at the Centre have been consistently saying that CAA has nothing to do with any citizen of India, even if they are Muslims.

The minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan have been given citizenship and illigrants immigrants will have to leave the country, he said.

""We cannot allow it if the illegal immigrants (ghuspaithiye) are holding protests,"" Tiwari stated.

The BJP leaders have been visiting people in different parts of the city explaining to them that CAA was not meant for taking away their citizenship, but was aimed at helping persecuted religious minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday led the party's door-to-door campaign in Lajpat Nagar area, visiting households and distributing literature to spread awareness about the CAA.

Union Minister and Delhi BJP's Assembly poll incharge Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday visited Madrasi Camp locality in Moti Bagh area, spreading awareness about the amended law on citizenship. Those spreading ""rumours"" about CAA are not well wishers of the country. Their objective will not be allowed to succeed, Javadekar stated.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tiwari-asks-shaheen-bagh-protesters-to-end-road-blockade.html

130,08-1-20,"Support anti-CAA, NRC protests but not bandh: Didi","Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday said she was in favour of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), but her party, Trinamool Congress, will not support bandh.

The Left parties had on December 26 last year called for a nationwide strike on January 8 and a seven-day protest from January 1 against the CAA, National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The State Government issued circulars warning the Government staff against joining the strike — saying absence from work could lead to the deduction of a day’s salary (causing breakage in servicecareer) — the TMC brass wondered in private whether the party should descend on the streets as it did every time to thwart a bandh at the risk of earning the wrath of the Muslim voters.

The Chief Minister earlier said, “I support the cause of the bandh but I am not for this bandh culture itself. So I will not allow any strike to take place in Bengal,” Banerjee said though the critics said the Chief Minister’s voice did not sound confident enough while issuing the Government fatwa so to say.

“The bandh is definitely taking place and I don’t think the Chief Minister will be so imprudent to oppose it at the cost of exposing herself as a true friend of the BJP and Narendra Modi,” CPI(M) Legislature Party leader Sujan Chakrabarty said adding, “she had issued a circular but that will not be taken seriously because despite the public posturing against CAA-NRC her concern is not genuine, thanks to the hidden relationship she has with the BJP… scam-tainted TMC is afraid of the BJP Government because its neck is in the hands of the Central Government which is with using Sharada and Narada and other scams against it.”

Even the TMC leaders were not forthcoming on the issue of directly opposing the bandh.

A senior TMC leader and an MLA said “I don’t see any reason to descend on the streets to confront the pro-bandh people. The Government has already made public its decision.”

132,08-1-20,Court rejects Karti’s discharge plea in tax evasion case,"nThe Special Court for the trial of MPs and MLAs in Chennai on Tuesday dismissed a petition filed by Karti Chidambaram MP and his wife Dr Srinidhi in connection with a tax evasion case and ordered the prosecution (Deputy Director of Income Tax Investigation ) to go ahead with the framing of charges.

When the plea by the Chidambarams came up for hearing on Tuesday, judge D Lingheswaran found merit in the evidence submitted by the prosecution and hence dismissed the request by the couple. The judge asked the prosecution to frame charges and ordered Karti and Srinidhi to be present in the court on January 21. If they fail to be present on that day, the judge said that warrant would be issued against them.

The Income Ta Department’s contention was that Karti, (son of former finance minister and Congress strongman P Chidambaram) and his wife Dr Srinidhi had received Rs 1.35 crore in cash towards the sale of a plot of land at Muttukad near Chennai but the same was not disclosed by them while filing tax returns.

The argument of Karti and his wife was that the said transaction was completed and tax returns were filed in 2015 itself. The Deputy Director of Income Tax (Investigation) Chennai had filed a complaint against the duo in September 2018 before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court (Economic Offences) under sections 276(c)1 and 277 of the Income Tax Act. The case was later transferred to the special court for trail of MLAs and MPs.

During the hearing, the Income Tax Department told the court that Karti received Rs 6.38 crore in cash while his wife received Rs 1.35 core in cash for the same of the land.

It was also alleged that Nalini Chidambaram (Karti’s mother) received the payment in the form of cheque while the son and his wife received cash.

It may be remembered that the Income Ta Department and the Enforcement Directorate had conducted a joint raid at the office and residence premises of Karti in December 2015 and had seized several documentary evidences including electronic materials related to the transaction of money. The department had submitted the entire data to

the court.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/court-rejects-karti---s-discharge-plea-in-tax-evasion-case.html
133,08-1-20,Farmers’ protests over shifting of capital turn violent,"The farmers’ agitation in protest against the shifting of the Capital from Amaravati turned violent on the 21st day on Tuesday. Stepping up their pressure on the Government, about 5,000 people took out a rally on the National Highway 9 at Chinna Kakani and squatted on the road.

Tension built up in the area when the agitators attacked the car in which Macherla MLA Pennelli Ramakrishna Reddy was travelling. The car was damaged and the MLA’s gunmen were injured in the attack. The protesters used stones and sticks to carry out the in what appeared to be a well-planned attack. The protesters surrounded the MLA’s car coming from the service road on which the car was moving.

A huge traffic jam was caused on either side of the highway due to the incident.

Later, addressing a Press conference, Ramakrishna Reddy said that TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu had engineered the attack and that this kind of tactics would not work. “If the farmers have any grouse, they should stage peaceful protests in a democratic manner and come for talks with the Chief Minister,” he said.

Naidu was using the goondas to intimidate people only to protect his lands in Amaravati, Ramakrishna Reddy said and challenged him to come for a direct fight anywhere in the State. “I am the son of Palnandu. You will never succeed in threatening me,” he challenged Naidu.

The police have begun the exercise of identifying the people who attacked the Macherla MLA. They are said to be using drones and CC TV cams to bring the culprits to book.

Earlier in the day, the police kept TDP leaders under house arrest in Guntur and Krishna districts. TDP MP Kesineni Nani and former MLA Bonda Umamaheswa Rao were not allowed to come out of their houses. In Guntur, TDP MP Galla Jayadev was kept under house arrest.

Former ministers Nara Lokesh and Kollu Ravindra were arrested in Vijayawada. Lokesh expressed solidarity with Vijayawada-East MLA Gadde Rammohan whose 24-hour hunger-strike in protest against the shifting of the Capital from Amaravati ended at 11 a.m. Lokesh entered into an argument with the police asking them on what grounds they were attacking him.

TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu condemned the house of TDP leaders and called the action undemocratic. He said it showed how autocratically the State government was acting against the Opposition leaders who expressing solidarity with the agitating farmers.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/farmers----protests-over-shifting-of-capital-turn-violent.html

136,08-1-20,"7 years on, little has changed where Nirbhaya boarded bus","Darkness still lurks at 'the' bus stand in south Delhi's Munirka locality with women battling lewd remarks and stares, demonstrating that little has changed in the seven years since a young intern who came to be known as Nirbhaya boarded a bus for a ride that was to be her last.

On Tuesday, a Delhi court announced that the four men convicted in her gangrape and murder will be hanged on January 22 at 7 am, putting the spotlight back on the bus stand where the shadows are deep and dark.

Women, who are regular commuters, say the bus stop turns into an unauthorised parking area after 9 pm and they have to face unwelcome comments and leering men almost every day.

A 24-year-old woman, who did not wish to be named, said the security measures promised by authorities after the gangrape and murder are yet to see the light of day.

""There was talk about installing CCTV cameras at the bus stop and GPS devices in buses, but this bus stop is still a haunted place,"" she said. ""I travel across Delhi for work but I live in Munirka village. My parents are not as concerned when I go to other places as they are when I come here. Somebody has to pick me up as soon as I deboard here,"" she added.

The physiotherapy intern, known the world over as 'Nirbhaya', the fearless one, was only a year younger when she boarded a bus from the exact spot on the night of December 16, 2012, with a friend.

The 23-year-old was brutalised and gangraped by six persons, including a minor, before being thrown out on the road, her injuries so severe that she died a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital. Her friend was also assaulted.

More than seven years later, Rani Kumari, 27, who works as a beautician in Green Park, said the bus stop turns into an unauthorised parking spot after 9 pm every day and it is a challenge to avoid ""creepy"" men who gather here.

""After I leave work, I take a bus till Munirka. When I get down at the bus stop, many autos are parked here. It is very difficult to avoid the stares of auto drivers,"" she said.

""The worst part is that they refuse to drop you home, saying they are done for the day. However, they are never too tired to pass lewd comments or follow you when you walk back home,"" she added.

Meena, 35, shared similar concerns. ""The government says we can complain if an auto driver refuses us a ride at night. One day, I forcibly sat in the only auto that I found at the bus stop. I told the driver that he could not say no to dropping me or I would lodge a complaint.

""He said his auto didn't have enough CNG. I knew he was lying, but I had no option but to get down and walk in the dark,"" she said. The Nirbhaya case triggered change in India's rape laws. But on the ground, not much may have changed. Of the six men convicted, Ram Singh allegedly committed suicide in jail and the juvenile was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term. The four men facing the death sentence are Mukesh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/7-years-on--little-has-changed-where-nirbhaya-boarded-bus.html
137,08-1-20,"Students seek V-C’s scalp, allege vandalism, FIR fake","Days after violent attack on the students by a group of masked mob, the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) administration has filed an FIR against about 20 students on Tuesday, including the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh, vice president and general secretary for vandalimsm at server room.

Following which students demanded immediate resignation of JNU Vice Chancellor Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar saying the university administration has registered a fake FIR.

The students raised slogans “Mamidala Hatao, JNU Bachao” demanding an enquiry be conducted on him for his spate of irregualirites. ""The Delhi Police and the Home Ministry also must be held accountable. The students of JNU have faced down violence and maligning before and we shall do so now,"" read the statement further.

JNU Registrar Pramod Kumar was not available for comment. ""This is another instance of this administration's attempt to criminalise the democratic protest led by JNUSU while at the same time protecting the ABVP henchmen who work as loyal footsoldiers of this VC. For more than 70 days students of JNU have been peacefully protesting the illegally passed IHA Manual and Fee Hike while the JNU administration has not engaged in any meaningful dialogue. Over the past four days, the peaceful students have been repeatedly exposed to violence from the ABVP, JNUTF's sanghi faculty and Cyclops security guards,"" said JNUSU in a statement issued on Tuesday.

On Sunday, a group of masked mob illegally entered the campus periyar hostel premises carrying sticks brutally beaten the students, teachers and vandalized the properties. About 30 students were grievously injured during the violent mayhem that took place inside the hostel.

JNUSU, said, ""On the morning of 4th, students were attacked while they were sleeping by the administration's stormtroopers. The dean Ashwini Mohapatra along with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarti Parishad (ABVP) goons attacked students who were protesting in favour of registration boycott and similarly in School of Language, Mazhar Asif led the ABVP goons.

On the same day, the ABVP unleashed extreme violence on students who were peacefully protesting and attempted to mob lynch JNUSU General Secretary Satish Chandra Yadav.""

The students alleged that the masked mob were led 'ABVP goons' who targeted ""JNUSU President Aishe Ghosh and repeatedly attacked her on head with sharp weapons which can be seen as nothing but an attempt to murder.""

""These goons indiscriminately attacked students and teachers who were attending JNUTA's peace gathering, entered hostels, including women's hostels, and went on a rampage. This was facilitated by the administration — the cyclops security guards did nothing to stop the rioting ABVP goons even as the street lights were switched off. Teachers were attacked when the JNUTA organised a peace gathering and the barbaric assault on Prof. Sucharita Sen who was hit with a brick shows the intent of the henchmen hired by Mamidala,"" they said.

""For all this the administration has remained completely silent and instead has now tried to criminalise the peaceful students of JNU, completely exposing the saffron nexus of the ABVP-Administration,"" said JNUSU.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/students-seek-v-c---s-scalp--allege-vandalism--fir-fake.html

In this tiger less jungle, a tiger from Bandhavgarh and tigress from Pench Tiger Reserve were relocated in April 2018. They both were named N-2 and N-1. The Tigress N-1 gave birth to 3 cubs few months ago, who were captured in a camera with their mother yesterday for the first time. This is a significant achievement for Madhya Pradesh, which has achieved the status of Tiger State with 526 tigers this year.

A large number of leopards, Nilgais, spotted dears, hyenas, bears and different types of birds are found in this sanctuary, which is spread in an area of 900 sq km of Sagar, Damoh and Narsinghpur districts. In this sanctuary with an area equal to the Kanha Tiger Reserve, the population of tigers had become nil in the last several years. The Forest department after developing the Nouradehi sanctuary as a best wildlife habitat area for many years shifted the tiger from Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve and the orphan tigress nurtured by the employees from the Pench Tiger Reserve.

The Tiger N-2 grew up in the natural environment, whereas the Tigress N-1 is a daughter of the famous Nala Tigress of the Pench Tiger Reserve. After her mother's death, the 3-month-old cub was raised in the Ghorela enclosure of Kanha and released at the age of 2 years 3 months in the Nouradehi Sanctuary.

The tigress raised by human beings is protecting and nurturing its cubs with utmost care. The picture that is trapped in the camera makes it clear that the three cubs are fully healthy and the mother is teaching them the skills to lead wild life.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---nouradehi-sanctuary-succeeds-in-tiger-relocation---.html

143,08-1-20,‘Masked’ men will soon be exposed: Govt,"The Centre on Tuesday said “masked” men involved in the JNU attack will be exposed soon as the Home Ministry has ordered an enquiry into the incident even as it slammed a few “selective “anarchists” raising placard reading “Free Kashmir” in Mumbai.

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of an event, Information & Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said misunderstandings are deliberately being spread in JNU and others parts of the country to incite violence. He hit out at New York Times (NYT) for a report in which the leading US daily claimed that the attackers at JNU had raised chants of “Jai Shri Ram”.

“I feel that the Home Minister has ordered an enquiry and the masked men involved in the JNU attack will soon be unmasked. Also, misunderstandings are deliberately being spread in JNU and in others parts of the country to incite violence, which will also be exposed,” said Javadekar.

On Sunday, a mob of masked men stormed the JNU campus in south Delhi and systematically targeted students in three hostels, unleashing mayhem with sticks, stones and iron rods, hitting inmates and breaking windows, furniture and personal belongings. They also attacked a women’s hostel.

In a dig at the NYT, Javadekar said it seems the NYT consists of the most “ardent bhakts” of Lord Ram as they seem to find him everywhere. He also said he was waiting to read the newspaper’s report on last week’s violence at a historic Sikh shrine in Pakistan.

The Union Minister’s criticism of the US daily came a day after he hit out at British daily Financial Times for referring to the masked mob that attacked JNU students and teachers as “nationalists”, asking it to stop predicting India’s disintegration at every opportunity.

Tagging screenshots of the NYT report, Javadekar said on Twitter, “It seems @nytimes consists of the most ardent bhakts of Lord Ram as they seem to find him everywhere. On a serious note, waiting to read @nytimes ground reporting of the violence and religious persecution from Shri Nankana Sahib. Which slogans did they hear there?”

In a series of tweets on Monday slamming the British daily, Javadekar had said, “I know it’s a bit too much for you to understand India, but here’s an effort: Stop predicting the breaking apart of India at every possible chance you get. India is a diverse democracy and it has always assimilated all differences to emerge stronger.”

Maintaining that peace has been prevailing and the region is making progress since Article 370 of the Constitution was repealed, Javadekar said, “The entire country is supporting the move... Few selective anarchists are raising such kind of slogans. Nobody even inside Kashmir raised such slogans. Now if someone outside the region gives such slogan that makes no sense.”

For his part senior BJP leader and Union Minority Affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act were driven by “pirated propaganda” as the legislation is for providing citizenship and not take it away.

The conspiracy by some people to disturb the secular fabric and unity of the country through the philosophy of “Jhuthmev Jayate (lie will prevail)” will be defeated, Naqvi told reporters here.

Naqvi said the protests influenced by “pirated propaganda” are going on over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the truth is that the Act will provide citizenship and not to take it away from any person.

Appealing to students and the youth, he said they should not get influenced by “evils of misinformation” and must become a part of the effort to strengthen communal harmony and unity of the country. The constitutional, religious and social rights of every Indian are absolutely safe, he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---masked----men-will-soon-be-exposed--govt.html
144,08-1-20,SC asks Centre to look into PIL on RBI branch exchanging currency defaced by Kashmiri separatists,"The Supreme Court asked the Centre on Tuesday to look into a PIL seeking CBI probe into the RBI exchanging defaced currency notes worth Rs 30 crore allegedly belonging to a separatist group of Kashmir, and said “the issue may be of national importance”.

The top court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to have a copy of the petition and look into it. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant was hearing the PIL filed by one Satish Bhardwaj, who has alleged that in 2013 the Jammu branch of RBI exchanged the currency notes amounting to Rs 30 crore allegedly belonging to a separatist group called ‘Kashmir Graffitti’.

As soon as the matter came up for hearing, the bench asked for Attorney General K K Venugopal, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta or any Additional Solicitor General.

When no one appeared, the bench told Bhardwaj that it would take up the matter at the end of the day’s work. Bhardwaj said he had approached the CBI for investigation of the matter but nothing has been done so far.

The matter was taken up again by the bench for hearing during which Mehta appeared.

The bench told Mehta, “He is saying that agencies are not doing anything. The issue may be of national importance. Please have a copy of the petition and look into it.”

Bhardwaj, appearing in-person in his plea, said, “It is most humbly submitted that the act of Jammu branch of Reserve Bank of India to exchange the defaced/ imperfect Indian currency notes worth Rs 30 crore that too which was done by a separatist group of Kashmir with a main aim of destabilising peace and harmony in the region of Jammu and Kashmir and to create an environment of tension and terror in the minds of common residents of the region is illegal and worth of interference of this court.”

145,08-1-20,"‘Free Kashmir’ placard holder apologises, bats for J&K peace","The Mumbai Police on Monday registered an FIR against writer and “story-teller” Mehak Mirza Prabhu for holding a “Free Kashmir” during the anti-JNU violence protests at the Gateway of India in south Mumbai on Monday evening.

The Colaba police registered an FIR against Prabhu under section 153-B (Imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) of IPC for holding a “Free Kashmir” placard.

The Colaba police also registered an FIR against Suvarna Salve, Firoz Mithiborwala, Umar Khalid and other activists for unlawful assembly at Gateway of India, while the MRA Marg police registered an FIR against 31 protestors including Suvarna Salve, Mithiborwala, Umar khalid and others for taking out morcha from Hutatma Chowk to Gateway of India and another FIR against ABVP students for their protest at Hutatma Chowk in south Mumbai.

Earlier in the day, under severe flak from various quarters for holding “Free Kashmir” during the anti-JNU violence protests at the Gateway of India, Mehak Mirza Prabhu apologised for her act and said that through her placard, all she intended to convey that Kashmir be freed from internet lockdown witnessed during the last five months.

On a day when former Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Fadnavis and hundreds of others slammed her act saying that it was part of an “anti Indian campaign”, Prabhu put out a video on Facebook to explain the objective behind her holding “Free Kashmir” placard at Monday’s protests near the Gateway of India.

“The picture created by entire social media came as an absolute shock to me. Placard meant freedom to express themselves(sic), freedom from the internet lockdown which many people have been voicing for. I was voicing my solidarity for basic constitutional right. No other agenda or motive what so ever. If by being naive in understanding the impact it would have, and in the process created this stir, I apologise,” Prabhu said in her preface to her video message.

The day began with Fadnavis putting out a tweet: “Protest is for what exactly? Why slogans of “Free Kashmir”? How can we tolerate such separatist elements in Mumbai? ‘Free Kashmir’ slogans by Azadi gang at 2km from CMO? Uddhav ji are you going to tolerate this Free Kashmir Anti India campaign right under your nose???”.

Senior Maharashtra minister Jayant Patil responded swiftly to Fadnavis’ tweet and said: Devendraji It’s ‘free Kashmir’ from all discriminations, bans on cellular networks and central control. I can’t believe that responsible leader like you trying to confuse people by decoding words in such a hatred way. Is it losing power or losing self control?”.

In quick retort, Fadnavis responded to Patil, tweeting: What a pity! Now separatist tendencies get a Government advocate. Jayantrao, this vote bank politics is not expected from you. Kashmir has already been freed from discrimination and ... certain curbs have been there since decades for security concerns. Be it in the Govt or opposition, for us, the only principle is NATION FIRST!”

Shiv Sena spokesperson and MP Sanjay Raut said that his party would not tolerate if anybody talks of freedom of Kashmir from India. “I read that the person who held the ‘Free Kashmir’ poster has clarified that she meant the people of Kashmir should be free from restrictions on Internet services, mobile services and other issues. It doesn’t mean that they advocate freedom from India,” Raut said, while talking to media persons.

Meanwhile, in her video, Prabhu said: “First of all let me tell you that I am not a Kashmiri.. My surname is Prabhu. I am a Maharashtra. I am born and brought up in Mumbai. The narrative that is being put out (that I am a Kashmiri) is absolutely wrong.

“Like anybody elsewhere who believes in democracy, I had also joined the protest (at the Gateway of India) last evening. There were a lot of groups. Some were singing, while others were raising slogans about all the issues. We were there to express our solidarity with the JNU students. I was going around. People were making placards,” she said.

“The first thing came to my mind is that I am here to talk about basic constitutional rights and freedom. Because of the shutdown that there is in Kashmir for the last five months, those rights are not there for Kashmiris. You say that they ( Kashmiris) are ours, we have to treat them as ours. They should get basic rights that we are getting. They should have freedom to express themselves It was with this thought in mind that I held that “Free Kashmir” placard I was quietly standing with a flower in my hand,” she said.

“Some people are saying that I am member of some gang or organisation. I have been paid to stand there. That was not the case with me. You can find out all about me. I am a story teller. All my stories are there on Youtube. You can see for yourselves what are the things I talk about. I am a compassionate person. You see my techtop, you will get know all about my life and what I have been doing all these years,” she said.

“The way the whole thing has gone is very scary. I am just a simple person. As a woman, it is scary for my safety right now. Please spread my side of the story among the people. Let’s stop it here. If it has happened to me, it can happen to anyone. I do not want to live with so much of fear,” Prabhu concluded.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---free-kashmir----placard-holder-apologises--bats-for-j-k-peace.html

147,08-1-20,"Ex-MLAs meet L-G, seek Statehood restoration","Eight former legislators led by Syed Altaf Bukhari on Tuesday became the first group of mainstream politicians to open the channels of communication with the office of Jammu & Kashmir’s Lieutenant Governor and making a slew of demands including restoration of statehood.

The delegation met Lt Governor GC Murmu in Jammu and submitted a 15-point memorandum demanding rights of people over land and jobs be safeguarded, detainees be released and cases against youth be withdrawn among others.

Accompanied by former ministers Ghulam Hassan Mir, Mohd Dilawar Mir, former MLA’s Javed Hassan Beig, Noor Mohd Sheikh, Choudhary Qamar Hussain, , Raja Manzoor Ahmad, former MLC’s Zafar Iqbal and Syed Asghar Ali, Bukhari demanded restoration of statehood, protection of rights over land and jobs, immediate release of detainees and restoration of internet services etc, during their maiden meeting with the Lt-Governor here in Raj Bhawan, Jammu.

The cavalcade of these political leaders reached Raj Bhawan, shortly after 2.30 p.m where they remained closeted with the Lt-Governor for about one hour.

Drawing attention of the Lt-Governor towards the socio-political and economic situation that emerged since August 5, 2019 (Nullification of Article 370 and reorganisation of erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir), the delegation leaders submitted in their memorandum that the majority of its residents are yet to reconcile with this decision.

Highlighting the demand for restoration of statehood, delegation led by Altaf Bukhari claimed, “majority of people in Jammu and Kashmir feel hurt and there are vocal concerns wherein they feel their decades long privileges were unceremoniously curtailed”. The delegation leaders also maintained, “To win over the confidence of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, the centre will have to re-examine its decades old policies vis-a-vis Kashmir”.

Referring to the emotive issue of safeguarding rights over land and jobs, the delegation leaders maintained that the most important issue can be addressed by tangible legal and constitutional safeguards that can be put in place by virtue of which protection of Domicile Rights including that of reservation for the permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir in the matter of employment and that of admissions to professional courses is ensured.

To fulfil the aspirations of people of Jammu and Kashmir, the delegation leaders also demanded withdrawal of cases against youth, restoration of JK Bank’s functional dominion, reviving horticulture and agriculture sectors,support for industry and manufacturing sector, tourism and allies industries and their revival, restoration of internet, relief for general trader including shop keepers, bus and Raxi owners, relief for unemployed youth and National Highway and Regional connectivity within J&K and cap on airfares.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ex-mlas-meet-l-g--seek-statehood-restoration.html

Talking to reporters, JKPCC minority wing vice chairmen Gurdarshan Singh and Michael Wazir expressed serious concern over the repeated incidents of killings, abductions and attacks on religious places in Pakistan.

They strongly condemned the incidents of abduction of girls and women of minority communities, and the killing of Sikh youth Parvinder Singh in Peshawar by unidentified miscreants.

The Congress leaders expressed strong resentment over the alleged mob attack at Nankana Sahib and the failure of the Pakistani government to contain radical groups.

They described Pakistan as a failed state due to its fundamentalist approach from the very beginning.

Ensuring the safety and security of minorities and protecting their religious and civil rights was the foremost duty of any country, the two leaders said.

“Pakistan could never sustain as a successful democracy as compared to India because of its fanatic outlook,” Singh said.

154,08-1-20,Indian Cobra with 19 genes is noxious predator: Scientists,"Indian Cobra (Naja naja) has become the first of the ‘big four’ deadly snakes globally to be sequenced.

Researchers have successfully mapped the genome of this highly poisonous snake and decoded 19 key toxic genes that are responsible for its venom that is among the most noxious toxins in the animal kingdom - potent enough to fell an elephant.

Russell’s viper (Daboia russelli), saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus) and common krait (Bungarus caeruleus) are the other three in the ‘big four’ camp.

The genome sequencing of the Indian cobra is expected to help the scientists develop better antivenom and mitigate the snakebite crisis across the countries particularly India which reports around 2.8 million snakebite cases that lead to about 50,000 deaths annually.

“Targeting these 19 specific toxins using synthetic human antibodies should lead to a safe and effective antivenom for treating Indian cobra bites” said Dr Sekar Seshagiri, President, SciGenom Research Foundation (SGRF) and lead author of the study published in the latest edition of Journal Nature Genetics.

Currently, antivenom is produced by immunizing horses with extracted snake venom and is based on a process developed well over 100 years ago. This process is laborious and suffers from a lack of consistency leading to varying efficacy and serious side effects. Venom is a complex mixture of proteins encoded by genes that have been co-opted by some snakes as they evolved some 100 million years ago.

Globally each year, accidental contact with snakes leads to over 100,000 deaths while over 400,000 individuals suffer permanent disabilities

“It is about time we modernize antivenom development by leveraging genomics, recombinant protein expression and synthetic antibody development technologies. The Indian cobra genome and the catalogue of target toxins are a blueprint needed to do this. For the first time, we now have a full list of venom-relevant toxin genes of the Indian cobra” said Dr R Manjunatha Kini, Professor, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore and an author on the study.

“The Indian cobra is the first of the ‘big four’ deadly snakes to be sequenced. This is a major step towards understanding its venom components and it will effectively change the way antivenom is developed” said Dr George Thomas from AgriGenome Labs, India. He further added, “This study has provided a very high-quality reference genome that will make assessment of the Indian cobra genetic diversity possible and practical. It will be an important resource for conservation of this revered and feared Indian snake”.

“Obtaining the genomes and the venom gland genes from the other three of the ‘big four’ and the deadly African snakes such as the black mamba, carpet viper and spitting cobras is the logical next step. It will provide a complete platform for developing a safe, universal antivenom for snakebite victims all over India, Africa and other neighbouring countries” added Dr R Manjunatha Kini.

Safe and effective antivenom is a major unmet social need in India and other parts of the world. With the WHO classifying snakebite as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) in 2017, institutions such as the Welcome Trust and the Department of Biotechnology, under the Union Ministry of Science and Technology have announced funding for antivenom development here.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/indian-cobra-with-19-genes-is-noxious-predator--scientists.html
155,08-1-20,CIC: Disclose names of babus who faced disciplinary proceedings in last 10 years,"Taking a tough stand, the Central Information Commission (CIC) has directed the Governments at the Centre and States to disclose the names of IAS officers who faced disciplinary proceedings in the last ten years. Observing that “Caesar’s wife should be above suspicion”, Information Commissioner Divya

Prakash Sinha said the disclosure of information was in the larger public interest as these officers occupy high Government positions.

“The Commission is convinced with the aspect of larger public interest in disclosure of names of IAS officers against whom disciplinary inquiries have been initiated under Rule 8 of the AIS (Discipline

and Appeal) Rules because they occupy high government positions and lead to the famous idiom ‘Caesar’s wife should be above suspicion’ for ensuring transparency and probity in public life,” Sinha said.

The Information Commissioner was adjudicating the RTI appeal of Lucknow-based Nutan Thakur who had sought the list of IAS officers against whom disciplinary enquiries under Rule 8 of the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules were initiated since January 1, 2008. The Department of Personnel and Training had provided the list of 14 IAS officers on Central Deputation against whom the disciplinary proceedings were initiated.

“In view of foregoing, CPIO is directed to procure the list of names of the relevant IAS officers sought in the RTI Application working in the State cadres as well from Administrative Vigilance Department Desk of the DoPT and provide the same to the Appellant,” he said. Sinha, however, warned the department official who allowed Thakur to inspect personal records of the IAS officers.

“First appellate authority has grossly erred in providing opportunity of inspection of personal records pertaining to disciplinary proceedings of IAS officers to the appellant,” he noted. He said details of departmental inquiries initiated under Rule 8 of AIS (Discipline and Appeal Rules) against IAS officers, being their personal information, are exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act.

The other judges on the bench are Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, MM Shantanagoudar, SA Nazeer, R Subhash Reddy, BR Gavai and Surya Kant.

The nine-judge bench has been set up after a five-judge bench headed by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi, by a 3:2 majority verdict, referred the matter to a seven-judge bench while examining the review petition filed against the historic September 28, 2018, judgement which had allowed women of all ages to enter Sabarimala temple.

Besdies Justice Gogoi, Justices AM Khanwilkar and Indu Malhotra (the lone woman judge on the Bench) were in majority while Justices RF Nariman and DY Chandrachud had penned a minority verdict on November 14, 2019.

The apex court questioned the NGO, Samaj Parivartan Samudaya, which was not the original complainant in the case in which allegations were raised that Shivkumar as revenue minister in Karnataka in 2010 had changed the land use of forest land for residential purposes.

When the matter came up for hearing, a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde wanted to know from the NGO’s counsel Prashant Bhushan as to what has happened with the case filed by it before Lokayukta.

Bhushan told the bench, also comprising Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, that there were two other complainants before the Lokayukta on whose direction the charge sheet was filed before a special court which was later quashed by the high court.

He submitted that the NGO filed an intervention application when the two original complainants preferred to withdraw the appeals against the high court order.

The bench questioned the locus of the NGO in pursuing the case saying, “You cannot do piggyback, you cannot ride on somebody’s shoulder”.

When the bench said it wanted to know about the status of the complaint filed by the NGO, Bhushan said he will file a detailed affidavit and explain about the role played by the civil society that led to the filing of the charge sheet by the Lokayukta police.

This argument did not impress the bench which said, “We don’t want to know the role of the NGO but what happened to your complaint.”

The apex court asked Bhushan to show within two weeks if the NGO had previously filed a complaint with the Lokayukta.

“We are not clear who you are in this case. We want to know when did you file complaint before Lokayukta and what happened to it. We wish to know what you have done,” the bench said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ngo-faces-searching-questions-from-sc-in-corruption-case-against-shivkumar.html

Besides, a rebound in the domestic equity markets also supported the rupee.

At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened on a positive note at 71.73 against the US currency.

During the session, the domestic currency stayed strong and swung between a low of 71.87 and a high of 71.68. It finally closed at 71.82, showing a gain of 11 paise over its previous closing.

In the office segment, leasing of space rose by 27 per cent to touch record 60.6 million square feet (msf), backed by a surge in leasing activity by the information technology sector.

New supply of office space surged by 56 per cent in 2019 and was recorded at 61.3 msf.

Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director, Knight Frank India said, “2019 can be seen as a relatively positive year for the real estate sector.

The historic rise in the office transactions is a significant growth indicator for the office market as it represents the continued commitment of domestic and global corporations in the country’s growth potential despite the ongoing economic slowdown.”

The residential sector also overcame the negative market outlook by registering a growth in sales volumes as well as new launches, he added.

“Economic headwinds such as slower GDP growth, reduced industrial output, poor consumer sentiments, amongst others, presented significant challenges to the residential market throughout the year.

“However, the slew of recent fiscal and monetary incentives by the Government and Reserve Bank of India, seem to have had an arrestive impact on the real estate sector,” Baijal said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/housing-sales-saw-marginal-rise-in-2019--knight-frank.html
163,08-1-20,Govt taking steps to simplify taxation; curb harassment of honest taxpayers: FM,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said the government is taking various steps to simplify taxation system and eliminate harassment of honest taxpayers.

Addressing an event organised by Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), the Finance Minister said the Government is open to suggestions for the betterment of GST filing system.

Based on suggestions received from various stakeholders, Government is taking steps towards simplification of taxation system, she added.

In a bid to curb harassment of taxpayers, she said, a faceless e-assessment scheme was launched in October to eliminate interface between an assessing officer and a taxpayer.

The tax department has implemented a computer-generated document identification number (DIN) to ensure greater transparency and accountability in tax administration.

The DIN system, which became operative from 1 October 2019, will apply to all kind of communications from the income tax department, whether it is related to assessment, appeals, investigation, penalty and rectification, among others.

This development will also help taxpayers to detect fake notices and letters as the notice would be verifiable on the department’s e-filing portal.

Besides, the finance minister said, such cases have to be closed within 30 days.

She also said that there would be shopping festival held across the country soon.

In a bid to boost trade, Sitharaman had in September last year announced Dubai-like mega shopping festivals in India, starting March 2020.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-taking-steps-to-simplify-taxation--curb-harassment-of-honest-taxpayers--fm.html

Speking at the second day of the National Traders Convention of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), Sitharaman assured them that the Government is making all attempts to simplify and rationalise the GST tax structure to the extent that even an ordinary trader can comply with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) provisions.

“Under the chairmanship of the Revenue Secretary, a committee has been constituted, which is working day and night to explore the ways and means to simplify GST”, she said.

Traders from across the country are attending the three-day convention.

Sitharaman lauded the role of the trading community for increasing the GST tax data.

CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said the body has set itself a target of enhancing the number of traders registered under GST to 2 crore.

Sitharaman said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has placed the trading community as his priority and in line with this, various announcements have been made by the Government to facilitate traders on growing their businesses.

The Finance Ministry is seized of the problems being faced by traders in the taxation system and the Government would do its utmost for providing maximum relief to traders, she said.

According to Sitharaman, while traders bring in tax revenue earners and no prudent government would like to annoy them, they, however, also need to bring their businesses into system and modernise their existing business formats.

The Government plans to hold big shopping festivals across the country and will involve CAIT so that traders may get more opportunities to showcase their products, she added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sitharaman-tells-traders-gst-will-be----simplified----further.html

In a communication to its members on Tuesday, the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) said that “in spite of several requests to clear our illegally withheld 25 per cent dues, there seems to be no intent to clear the dues immediately... It has been decoded by the Central Executive Committee (CEC) to conduct a secret ballot, as per the constitution of the ICPA, to make a decision between strike or NCLT to safeguard our interest.”

The grouping represents nearly 800 Air India pilots who fly narrow-body planes.

The ICPA decision came on the day the ministerial panel approved the Expression of Interest (EoI) as well as the share-purchase agreement for Air India’s privatisation, as per an official.

Late last year, the Association had written to the minister of state for civil aviation Hardeep singh Puri asking the government to clear their legitimate dues without any further delay.

167,08-1-20,Ganges delta may see water level rise of up to 1.4 m by 2100: Study,"The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta covering parts of eastern India and Bangladesh, and home to 200 million inhabitants, may experience a water level rise of up to 140 centimetres by the end of this century, a new study says.

The findings of the study, published in the journal PNAS on Monday, provides refined regional estimates of water level rise, and land subsidence -- the gradual settling or sudden sinking of the Earth’s surface -- and may lead to better flood mitigation efforts in eastern India and Bangladesh.

According to the researchers, including those from CNRS in France, this region is the largest and most densely populated delta in the world, and one of the most vulnerable places to climate change.

However, they cautioned that the extent and impact of water level rise there remain poorly known.

This delta, which covers nearly two thirds of Bangladesh, and part of eastern India, is already regularly prone to flooding, the study noted.

The region also frequently experiences intense monsoon rainfall, rising sea levels, river flows, and land subsidence, according to the researchers.

Until now, the scientists said, it has been difficult to disentangle these various factors.

Forecasts carried out so far have been based on highly regional measurements of water level, they added.

In the current study, the researchers analysed monthly readings from 101 gauges measuring water and sea levels across the delta.

Aggregating this data over geographical areas, they filtered out local effects and offset quality differences between gauges.

Over time, the scientists obtained more refined estimates for water level changes.

According to the study, between 1968 and 2012, water levels increased by three millimetres per year (mm/year) on average, a little more than the global mean sea level rise, which was two mm/year during the same time period.

The researchers then estimated the contribution of land subsidence —obtained by subtracting the measurements of relative water level obtained previously from the absolute sea level.

Their calculations revealed that the maximum land subsidence in the delta between 1993 and 2012 was between one and seven mm/year.

These values, the scientists said, are lower than some local measurements —between one and two centimetres per year (cm/year) in Dhaka, Bangladesh —which have been used as a reference until now.

The study cautions that if subsidence continues at the same rate, and even under a greenhouse gas mitigation scenario, water level rise in the delta, depending on the area, may reach 85-140 cm by the end of the century compared to the period 1986-2005 -- twice as high as the projections provided in the latest IPCC report.

According to the researchers, the study may lead to better forecasts of water level in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta and improved flood mitigation efforts.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ganges-delta-may-see-water-level-rise-of-up-to-1-4-m-by-2100--study.html
168,08-1-20,‘Regulators should not depend on Govt grant’,"Regulators in the country must have their own sources of income so that they do not have to depend on grants provided by the government, capital markets watchdog Sebi’s former Chairman UK Sinha has said. In his new book ‘Going Public: My Time at Sebi’, Sinha has said that financial independence is the basic requirement for the functioning of an independent regulator. A regulator should have its own source of income and flexibility to utilise it without looking up to the government for funds, he has written. “There have been some recent developments to take away this freedom and ask Sebi to park its income in the Consolidated Fund of India or in the Public Account, and to seek prior approval of government before incurring any capital expenditure. Such efforts are not conducive in creating a strong and independent regulatory environment,” he said.

The Sebi Act provides for the regulator to levy fees and charges and create its own fund. The board of Sebi prepares its annual budget, where it can revise the rates of fees upwards and downwards based on its estimate of money required for its activities during the year. The Sebi board also has representation from the government. The former IAS officer said all other regulators also must have their own sources of income and not survive on the receipt of grants from the government. There have been reports that the government was pushing Sebi to transfer 75 per cent of its surplus to the Consolidated Fund of India, but Sebi is believed to have opposed the proposal on concerns about loss of autonomy. There have also been concerns in the recent past about autonomy of another major financial sector regulator, the Reserve Bank of India.

In the book published by Penguin India, Sinha said independence of a regulator should not be defined only with regard to independence from the government and its officials. It should also be seen in the context of independence from any outside influences, including those from market participants and business corporations, he said. Sinha said there have been concerns about market capture of regulators in other parts of the world and the senior leadership and the boards of the regulators have to remain extra cautious on this account. “Another dimension of independence is internal independence. Although the law permits this, the quasi-judicial function of Sebi needs to be separated from executive supervision,” he said. With regard to accountability, Sinha said independence and accountability go hand in hand. “Today, there is no satisfactory arrangement for a performance appraisal of a regulator like Sebi. The media does it. The government does it through the presence of their representatives in the Sebi board or while answering questions in Parliament,” he said.

According to Sinha, Parliamentary supervision over the regulators is a superior option to ensure accountability. The standing committee of Parliament for different ministries may have to take up this responsibility in a regular and structured way. Regulations formulated by Sebi are required to be placed before Parliament at the earliest. The Parliament has the right to reject or modify, but the same never happens. Hardly any subordinate legislation gets modified or rejected, Sinha has mentioned in his book. The Parliamentary committee on subordinate legislation has a huge task of reviewing not only the regulation framed by the multiple regulators but also the rules framed by various ministries under different laws.

“In order to help them perform this task on structured and continuous basis, substantial capacity has to be created in this committee and in other committees of Parliament, “ he noted.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/---regulators-should-not-depend-on-govt-grant---.html

170,08-1-20,Next ranking of states for ease of doing biz in March,"The Commerce and Industry Ministry is likely to release the next index to rank states and union territories (UTs) in terms of ease of doing business in March, a senior official said. “It will be released in end of February or March. Due to elections, the release got delayed,” the official said.

The exercise is aimed at triggering competition among states to improve business climate in order to attract domestic and global investors. State governments are taking several steps such as setting up single window system for approvals to improve ease of doing business.

The parameters include areas such as construction permit, labour regulation, environmental registration, access to information, land availability and single window system. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) in collaboration with the World Bank conducts an annual reform exercise for all states/UTs under the Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP). In the last ranking released in July 2018, Andhra Pradesh topped the chart. Telangana and Haryana were at the second and third positions, respectively.

Others in the top ten were Jharkhand (4), Gujarat (5), Chhattisgarh (6), Madhya Pradesh (7), Karnataka (8), Rajasthan (9) and West Bengal (10). The ranking is based on a combined score consisting of reform evidence score that is based on evidence uploaded by states/UTs and feedback score that is based on response garnered from actual users of services provided to businesses. The report to be released this year will rank states for 2018. In the World Bank’s latest ‘Doing Business’ report, India’s position improved to 63rd from 77th out of 190 economies. The Commerce and Industry Ministry has prepared a blueprint to further improve India’s ranking in the World Bank’s ease of doing business index with a focus on six parameters, including enforcing contracts and starting a business.

Besides, a secured creditor will have to contribute its share towards insolvency resolution and liquidation process costs and workmen’s dues within 90 days of the liquidation commencement date, an official release said on Tuesday.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) provides for time-bound and market-linked resolution process for stressed corporates. In case the resolution process does not materialise, then the entity goes for liquidation. The release said the IBBI has notified changes to the liquidation process regulations with effect from January 6. The amendment also provides a process for a stakeholder to seek withdrawal from the corporate liquidation account.

“The amendment clarifies that a person, who is not eligible under the code to submit a resolution plan for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor, shall not be a party in any manner to a compromise or arrangement of the corporate debtor under section 230 of the Companies Act, 2013,” it said.

Further, a secured creditor cannot sell or transfer an asset, which is subject to security interest, to any person who is not eligible under the code to submit a resolution plan for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor. “The amendment provides that a secured creditor, who proceeds to realise its security interest, shall contribute its share of the insolvency resolution process cost, liquidation process cost and workmen’s dues, within 90 days of the liquidation commencement date,” the release said. Also, the secured creditor has to pay excess of realised value of the asset, which is subject to security interest, over the amount of its claims admitted, within 180 days of the liquidation commencement date. According to the release, where the secured creditor fails to pay such amounts to the liquidator within 90 days or 180 days, as the case may be, the asset should become part of the Liquidation Estate.

Among others, the amendment provides that a liquidator should deposit the amount of unclaimed dividends and undistributed proceeds in a liquidation process along with any income earned thereon into the corporate liquidation account before an application for dissolution is submitted.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/secured-creditor-can---t-sell-assets-to-entities-ineligible-for-insolvency-plan.html
172,08-1-20,"Sebi comes out with system audit framework for exchanges, clearing corp","In order to keep pace with the technological advancements in the securities market, Sebi on Tuesday came out with new framework on system audit for market infrastructure institutions (MIIs), stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories, wherein they need to inform about major non-compliances.

The decision has been taken based on discussions with stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories along with recommendations of Sebi’s Technical Advisory Committee.

In a circular, the regulator has asked MIIs to conduct an annual system audit as per the prescribed framework and terms of reference.

Also, they have been asked to maintain a list of all the relevant Sebi circular and directions, among others, pertaining to technology and compliance under a stipulated time frame and the same need to be included under the scope of system audit.

Further, they have been asked to submit information with regard to exceptional major or minor non-compliances observed in the system audit and categorically highlight those observations pointed out in the system audit (current and previous) which remain open.

The system audit report, including compliance with Sebi guidelines and exceptional observation format along with compliance status of previous year observations, needs be placed before the governing board of the MIIs and then the report along with the comments of the MII’s management needs to be communicated to Sebi within a month of completion of audit.

Further, along with the audit report, MIIs need to submit a declaration from their managing directors or chief executive officers certifying the security and integrity of their IT systems.

With regard to the audit process, Sebi said the audit needs to be conducted according to the norms, terms of reference and guidelines issued by it. The governing board of the MII will appoint auditor who can perform a maximum of three successive audits. However, such auditor will be eligible for re-appointment after a cooling-off period of two years.

Further, during the cooling-off period, the incoming auditor should not include: Any firm that has common partner with the outgoing audit company. The period of the audit will not be more than 12 months. Further, the audit will be completed within 2 months from the end of the audit period.

According to Sebi, the overall timeline from the last date of the audit period till completion of final compliance by MII, including follow-on audit, if any, should not exceed one year.

In exceptional cases, if MII is of the view that compliance with certain observations may extend beyond a period of one year, then the concerned MII shall seek specific approval from the governing board, it added.

In respect of auditor selection norms, Sebi said the auditor must have minimum 3 years of demonstrable experience in IT audit of securities industry or financial services sector - banking, insurance and fin-tech.

The auditor should have the capability to undertake forensic audit and undertake such audit as part of annual system audit, if required and must not have any conflict of interest.

Sebi said a detailed report with regard to the system audit needs be submitted to it. The detailed report should include executive summary with details about unit where the audit is conducted and the findings.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sebi-comes-out-with-system-audit-framework-for-exchanges--clearing-corp.html

175,08-1-20,Willing to testify before Senate: John Bolton,"Months after he was fired by US President Donald Trump, former national security advisor John Bolton on Monday said he is ready to testify before the Senate on Trump’s impeachment trial.

The surprising move by 71-year-old Bolton adds a new dimension to the ongoing impeachment proceedings against Trump, who is only the third president in the US’ history to face such an attempt to remove an elected president from power.

“I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify,” he said in a statement on Monday night.

The House, he said, has concluded its Constitutional responsibility by adopting articles of Impeachment related to the Ukraine matter.

“It now falls to the Senate to fulfil its Constitutional obligation to try impeachments, and it does not appear possible that a final judicial resolution of the still-unanswered Constitutional questions can be obtained before the Senate acts,” he said.

Bolton said accordingly, “since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study.”

He added that during the present impeachment controversy, he has tried to meet his obligations both as a citizen and as a former national security advisor.

Unlike the House of Representatives, where the opposition Democratic party enjoyed a majority, the ruling Republicans have majority in the Senate.

The Democrats have alleged that they do not expect a fair trial in the Senate. The charges have been denied by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, on the Senate floor demanded that Bolton be subpoenaed during the trial for his testimony. He described, Bolton as one of the key witnesses with knowledge of the president’s dealings with Ukraine, about how decisions were made to withhold security assistance, and how opposition within the administration to that delay that Trump seemed to want, was overcome.

176,08-1-20,US strike on Iran could have consequences in N Korea,"The US strike that killed Iran’s top military commander may have had an indirect casualty: a diplomatic solution to denuclearizing North Korea.

Experts say the escalation of tensions between Washington and Tehran will diminish already fading hopes for such an outcome and inspire North Korea’s decision-makers to tighten their hold on the weapons they see, perhaps correctly, as their strongest guarantee of survival.

North Korea’s initial reaction to the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani has been cautious. The country’s state media was silent for several days before finally on Monday issuing a brief report on the attack that didn’t even mention Soleimani’s name.

The Korean Central News Agency report didn’t publish any direct criticism by Pyongyang toward Washington, instead simply saying that China and Russia had denounced the United States over last week’s airstrike at the airport in Baghdad.

The North’s negotiations with the US have been at a stalemate since last February, when a summit between leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump collapsed over disagreements about exchanging sanctions relief for nuclear disarmament.

The North has recently pointed to that lack of progress and hinted it may resume tests of nuclear bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles.

While the killing of Soleimani may give Pyongyang pause about provoking the Trump administration in such a way, the North ultimately is likely to use the strike to further legitimise its stance that it needs to bolster its nuclear arsenal as a deterrent against American aggression.

The North has often pointed to the demises of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi while justifying its nuclear development, saying they would still be alive and in power had they successfully obtained nuclear weapons and didn’t surrender them to the US.

Solemani’s name will soon be mentioned with them too, said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University.

“North Korea would say that the ‘imperialist’ nature of the United States would never change, and that there is no other option for them other than to strengthen its nuclear deterrent while bracing for long-term confrontation,” said Koh, an adviser to current South Korean President Moon Jae-in.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-strike-on-iran-could-have-consequences-in-n-korea.html
177,08-1-20,Germany to withdraw some troops from Iraq,"Germany will withdraw some of its troops deployed as part of the anti-IS coalition in Iraq, the Defence Ministry said on Tuesday, in the latest fallout over the US drone strike that killed a top Iranian general.

About 30 soldiers stationed in Baghdad and Taji will be moved to Jordan and Kuwait, a Defence Ministry spokesman told AFP, adding that the withdrawal will “begin shortly”.

Germany has deployed about 415 soldiers as part of the anti-IS coalition, with about 120 of its troops stationed in Iraq. Germany’s move came after the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution asking the government to end its agreement with the US-led coalition.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/germany-to-withdraw-some-troops-from-iraq.html
178,08-1-20,No decision on withdrawal of troops yet: US Def Secy,"The US has not taken any decision to withdraw American troops from Iraq, Defence Secretary Mark Esper has said, shortly after the US military in a letter to Iraqi officials said that the US forces would be relocating “to prepare for onward movement”.

Some 5,000 US soldiers are deployed in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the IS terror group. The Iraqi Parliament on Sunday passed a resolution to terminate the agreement that allows for American troops in the country.

Iraq’s move comes in response to the killing of Maj Gen Qasem Soleimani, the 62-year-old head of Iran’s elite al-Quds force and the architect of its regional security apparatus, in a US drone attack in Baghdad on Friday.

The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy chief of Iraq’s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

In a letter released on Monday, Marine Corps Brig Gen William H Seely said the US forces “respect your sovereign decision to order our departure”.

Seely said the US-led coalition would “be repositioning forces” and the American troops would be relocating “to prepare for onward movement”. “In order to conduct this task, Coalition Forces are required to take certain measures to ensure that the movement out of Iraq is conducted in a safe and efficient manner,” the letter stated.

However, shortly after the letter was released, Defence Secretary Esper said no decision has been taken yet to leave Iraq.

“There has been no decision whatsoever to leave Iraq. There’s no decision to leave, nor did we issue any plans to leave or prepare to leave,” he told reporters here on Monday.

The US remains committed to the campaign to defeat the Islamic State group in Iraq and the region, Esper said.

Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, during an off-camera briefing, told reporters that the letter incorrectly implies withdrawal and it was sent by “mistake”.

“It (the letter) was a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/no-decision-on-withdrawal-of-troops-yet--us-def-secy.html
179,08-1-20,Innovation is key,"Universities and schools need to invent new ways of teaching and learning that can create a lucrative environment for the students, says Nitish Jain

For all those who believe ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’, remember Kodak? The world’s biggest film company that went bankrupt in spite of developing the world’s first digital camera Mavica? And, at the other end of the spectrum, you have Adobe, a company that put its most successful product — Photoshop — on the cloud, moving from a product-based revenue model to a subscription —based one. Innovation is risky. Yes. But choosing to stay complacent is an even bigger risk.

When it comes to innovation, disruption and transformation, it is a sad but true fact that education is usually the last to catch up. Let me ask you — does a 400-year-old university system make sense in a world that is constantly being disrupted by technology? When the purpose of education itself is to produce change agents and leaders of tomorrow, how can our universities continue to adopt an ostrich-like mentality, continuing to pretend that conformity is better than change? Can’t technology be tasked with making education more engaging, personalised and cost-effective?

If the purpose of education is to provide talent for the jobs of tomorrow, it begs the question — what sort of talent do new-age companies need? The ones who have all the answers or the ones who would ask the right questions. Professor Google already has all the answers, so in reality, all they need are people to ask the right questions. And, this isn’t as simple as it sounds. Ask the wrong question and get the wrong answer. Students need to be able to critically analyse issues with ingenuity and creativity. Only then can they discover what the right question to ask is.

This gets us to the interesting question — so what really needs to change in education? The game has shifted from knowledge to skills. Passive learning is passé. Universities and schools need to pioneer new ways of teaching and learning that can create a lucrative environment for the students. Students should come to class every day prepared to practice and sharpen their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In-class assessments test their 21st-century skills; skills most sought by new-age companies. The traditional lecture-driven learning systems that most universities continue to use are now becoming redundant.

Change is being led by small product companies, not full-service universities. EdTech companies have introduced a lot of interesting tools to that end. Kahoot, for instance, enables the professor to ask questions to which all students reply using a tablet. This gets the full classroom to think critically versus a conventional system where a professor asks and only one student speaks. Coupled with gamification, it makes learning more fun and highly engaging.

Newsela is another app that seeks to help those with reading difficulties. Class Dojo provides teachers with a platform to track student behaviour and assign positive and negative remarks. Furthermore, professors can send instant messages to specific parents and share photos from the class. Students can choose their own avatar.

Schools are using some of the most cutting-edge emerging technologies today that replicate a real classroom-like experience at the homes and workspaces for students. This is particularly useful for working adults who need to sharpen their skills but don’t have the time to go to a physical campus.

These are examples of just a few EdTech products that could be used by schools and universities looking to create a 360-degree shift in the learning experience. There is a growing divergence between the right talent and obsolete talent. Universities who are quick to adapt would be the winners in the 21st century.

184,08-1-20,Brexit in sight as UK MPs scrutinise divorce deal,"Britain moves a step closer to a historic departure from the European Union on Tuesday (Jan 7), after more than three years of bitter division and political drama, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson brings his Brexit deal back to parliament without the threat of defeat, deadlock or delay.

Lawmakers begin three days of debate on legislation to enshrine Johnson’s divorce deal, with few hurdles to its passing expected after he won a comfortable majority at recent elections.

The air of inevitability that Brexit was finally about to happen contrasts starkly with the repeated postponements and rejections of the previous deal of his predecessor Theresa May that plunged Britain into political and economic uncertainty.

The lack of anticipated drama has instead seen focus shift to potential conflict between the United States and Iran. But the Conservative leader is still up against the clock.

Both the UK and European parliaments must ratify the deal before Britain’s Jan 31 departure date, when a so-called transition phase to the end of the year will kick in.

MPs gave their initial approval to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in a vote on Dec 20, a week after Johnson secured a majority of 80 in the 650-seat House of Commons.

They now have three days of debate before the bill passes to the unelected House of Lords for further scrutiny next week.

Opposition lawmakers and troublesome peers will try to amend the text but with such a comfortable majority, Johnson is virtually certain of getting it through on time.

In a sign of his confidence, Johnson’s government announced it would hold a new post-Brexit budget vote on Mar 11, to “seize the opportunities that come from getting Brexit done”.

The main opposition Labour party was meanwhile focused on the start of a campaign to replace veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn as leader.

His divisive leadership and ambivalence over Brexit were blamed for Labour’s stinging defeat and loss of support in its heartlands of northern England.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/brexit-in-sight-as-uk-mps-scrutinise-divorce-deal.html
185,08-1-20,Arrest warrant issued in Japan for Carlos Ghosn’s wife,"Prosecutors in Japan on Tuesday obtained an arrest warrant for Carole Ghosn, wife of former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn, who last month jumped bail and fled the country.

The warrant was issued as the fallout from the escape of one of Japan’s most high-profile criminal suspects continues, with authorities pledging tighter border controls and seizing the bail money that Ghosn forfeited by fleeing the country.

He had been facing trial in Japan on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies, before fleeing the country in late December for Lebanon, where he was reunited with his wife.

In a statement, prosecutors said they had obtained the warrant on suspicion that Carole Ghosn “made false statements” during April testimony to the Tokyo district court about meetings with an unnamed individual.

Carlos Ghosn had been freed on bail after agreeing to strict conditions, with prosecutors arguing he posed a flight risk.

Caught between the US and Iran and wary of being accused of seeking independence from Baghdad, the autonomous government of northern Iraq’s Kurdish region (KRG) has kept relatively mum on latest developments.

They include a US drone strike that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad and a federal parliament vote to oust foreign troops, all against the backdrop of months of anti-government rallies.

But statements from the KRG and from Iraq’s Pesident Barham Saleh, himself a Kurd, have been limited to calls for restraint and “respecting the sovereignty of Iraq”.

And on Sunday, not a single Kurdish lawmaker attended the federal parliament’s vote to oust foreign troops, declining to take a stance on the controversial issue.

“Iraq’s Kurds have adopted the short-term strategy of waiting,” Kurdish specialist Adel Bakawan told AFP.

He said Kurdish authorities were “speaking to everyone” in closed-door meetings, but waiting for the dust to settle before stating their position.

“They want to see what direction events will take and won’t pick one side or another until the situation becomes clearer,” Bakawan said.

“The New Year has begun with our world in turmoil. We are living in dangerous times,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told reporters here on Monday.

“Geopolitical tensions are at their highest level this century. And this turbulence is escalating,” he said.

Warning that even nuclear non-proliferation can no longer be taken for granted, he said the “cauldron of tensions” globally is leading more and more countries to take “unpredicted decisions with unpredictable consequences and a profound risk of miscalculation”.

Tensions are escalating between the US and Iran after Maj Gen Qassim Suleimani, who led the powerful Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, was killed in an American drone strike in Baghdad on Friday.

The strike was authorised by US President Donald Trump. Iran has vowed to avenge the killing of the elite Quds Force commander, and on Sunday it indicated that it would no longer be bound by the restrictions on its nuclear programme, outlined in the 2015 deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. The deal was debated in the Security Council just last month.

On Sunday, the Iraqi parliament also passed a non-binding resolution calling for US troops to leave the country, in a clear response to the killing of the Iranian general on their soil.

189,08-1-20,MindIT,"Burnout as a modern day health hazard. Such is the rise in this phenomenon of professionals working themselves to hell that World Health Organisation recently recognised burnout as an occupational phenomenon impacting health of individuals. Burn-out has been described as a syndrome conceptualised as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.

Feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and reduced professional efficacy are characteristics of this condition. A survey of 2,000 Americans found that 36% of respondents experienced on-the-job burnout every single week while another 56% felt burnt out on the job at least once a month. While we do not have a similar extended survey conducted in India, anecdotal evidence suggests the problem is deep rooted here as well.

According to the WHO, depression and anxiety alone cost global economy approximately one trillion dollars annually due to lost productivity. In fact, the WHO has deemed depression a leading cause of disability. Approximately one-third of the mental health cost burden is related to productivity losses, including unemployment, disability, and lower work performance.

From Neutron Star to a Star: The bright star in us begins to fade exactly as does the neutron star. The neutron star is known to be the brightest, and it works really hard to be big, bold, and impactful, till all the hydrogen runs out. And then it just bursts. The similarity is uncanny and we need to take heed and build resources to conserve our energy and provide us with long lasting productive health.

Remember, that it is the luminary employee that spontaneously combusts. It is the leader who has spent little time nurturing all the other aspects of his life. It is time that we promote the values key to good health and help provide nurturing work environments for our employees.

Having spent almost two decades in the business of wellbeing, our company defined the wellbeing hexagon. It is only when we incorporate a structure of wellbeing through the verticals can one completely flourish. Optimum health is skewed when any of these factors is given less credence than the other/s.

What is important to remember is that a decline of optimal health in any one of the vertical leads to an imbalance and the other pillars compensate for the loss of one until they burnout as well. Over the years organizations have initiated efforts to improve physical health of employees, thereby only focusing on one pillar of health for an individual. But only tending to physical health and skill development programmes tied in with leadership training, as currently done by HR, will not solve the problem. The mindset of employers needs to shift to a new understanding of being the principal providers for good holistic health practices.

Tackling burnout crucial to improving productivity: As consultants, we have documented internally the facade of wellbeing in corporates. There is no holistic structure being adopted. Most companies are creating a jigsaw puzzle of programmes, primarily App based that allows for metric and mathematical impact, but doesn't really implement deep change, especially since they have only 4% of employee sustainability and interaction.

Employers need to become mindful of the burden that employees face. The experience of an overworked mind leads to a lack of motivation, unforeseen errors, lack of positive interactions with the community. Mental health problems have an impact on employers and businesses directly through increased absenteeism, negative impact on productivity and profits, as well as an increase in costs to deal with the issue. In addition, they impact employee morale adversely.

Investing in the holistic health care is not an option now, it is a necessity. It ensures that employees are better equipped to understand how to utilize their abilities positively.

The global education hubs have created study abroad programmes that attract students from around the world. Factors like world-class faculty, practical skills and extensive research-based learning programmes have made destinations such as Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Germany most preferred.

The-career focused students of today are looking for more than just top-notch education. While choosing their overseas destination for studies, they also focus on the kind of post-study work scenario with the motive of enhancing their career prospects.

The facility of working in the same country immediately after completing the course can enhance a student’s plans. They also get an understanding of the course’s applicability in the host country.

Several education hubs have implemented post-study work visas that allow students to land their dream job in a foreign land.

For lakhs of Indians who choose to go overseas for their education every year, finding post-study work opportunities as well as securing permanent residence are the most important considerations.

How do UK, Canada, Australia, Singapore and Germany — compare?

Canada: A favourite destination due to its quality of education.

UK: The UK has recently pushed it further by offering a tw-year post-study work permit to the international students and affordable tuition fees.

194,08-1-20,Master Stokes,"Ben Stokes produced an explosive spell of bowling as England beat South Africa by 189 runs inside the last hour of the fifth day of the second Test at Newlands on Tuesday.

The win levelled the four-match World Test championship series. South Africa were bowled out for 248, with the last wicket falling when only 8.2 overs were left in the match.

Stokes took the last three wickets in the space of 14 balls to clinch the victory. He finished with three for 35.

South Africa defied the England bowlers for most of the day. Only three wickets fell before tea as South Africa defended grimly after starting the day on 126 for two after being set an improbable 438 to win.

Opening batsman Pieter Malan, making his debut, made 84 in 369 minutes and 288 balls before he fell to Sam Curran with the second new ball. But he was the only player to be dismissed before lunch and tea.

It meant England needed five wickets in the last session, with a minimum of 31 overs to be bowled.

Quinton de Kock fell to a rare loose shot after he and Rassie van der Dussen had batted together for more than two hours. De Kock, who made 50, had been troubled by Joe Denly's leg-spinners into rough outside his off stump -- but fell to a short ball which he pulled to midwicket.

Van der Dussen batted for 194 minutes and 140 balls, scoring only 17, before falling to a smart tactical move by England. He had been batting solidly against Stuart Broad when James Anderson moved to leg slip and Van Der Dussen promptly glance the next ball straight to Anderson.

Stokes produced an inspired spell of fast, hostile, short-pitched deliveries to have Dwaine Pretorius and Anrich Nortje caught in the slips off successive balls before he took the final wicket when Vernon Philander was caught at gully.

Australia took the tie, with John Millman winning the other singles against Greece’s Michail Pervolarakis 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7/1).

In contrast, Zverev cut a miserable figure after he meekly succumbed to another defeat, with the world number seven having some serious problems to iron out ahead of the Australian Open this month as he crash to Canada’s Denis Shapovalov 6-2, 6-2.

His poor form contributed to Becker-led Germany losing two of their three ties.

197,08-1-20,Numbers can help,"In order to become successful entrepreneur, a person should follow seven steps:

Step 1: One should first of all know his name number, psychic number & destiny number.

Step 2: Calculate the chronological age by subtracting the date of birth from the date of start of the work.

Step 3: We should see the month number also, which should also vibrate harmoniously with his destiny number. The friendly numbers of the destiny number 5 are 1,3,5,4,6,7,8,9 and enemy number is 2.

Step 4: The period in which business is to be started, month & date which is to be selected should vibrate harmoniously with the destiny number/psychic of the person/entrepreneur.

Step 5: The name of the firm/company or brand name, which should be kept by the person should be such that, its name number should be friendly with his Destiny number.

Step 6: Another thing which is important is the name of the person should vibrate harmoniously with the name of the brand.

Step 7: The address or the place where the project is to be launched or work is to be started. The number of the place should vibrate harmoniously with destiny number of the person.

If a person follows these small precautions, his chances of becoming successful will certainly increase. Though he has to work in the right way but his luck will be in his favour. In fact, due to lack of knowledge of numerology, people start planning of the new launch at any time of the year, convenient to them. They also select date & month which is more convenient to them and their relatives, irrespective of which date, month & year vibrate harmoniously with his destiny number/psychic number.

201,08-1-20,XAT Analysis,"The score of this exam used by institutes like SP Jain, IMT Ghaziabad, XIM Bhubaneshwar and GIM Goa for their Business and Human Resource Managment programmes was moderately easy to difficult, says Ankur Jain

The XAT 2020, conducted by XLRI Jamshedpur for admission to their Business Management and Human Resource Management programmes, was conducted on January 5, 2020. The score is also used by many reputed institutes like SP Jain, IMT Ghaziabad, XIM Bhubaneshwar and GIM Goa as a part of their admission process.

In terms of the pattern, it was similar to the last year’s paper. The total number of questions this year was 75. The paper had two parts — Part-I and Part-II.

Verbal and Logical Ability

Decision-making Ability

Quantitative Ability and Data Interpretation

Part-II comprised of General Knowledge

The duration of the test was 165 minutes for the first part and 15 minutes for the second.

All questions carried equal marks with negative marking (one-fourth of a mark for a wrong answer). There was a negative marking of 0.1 for un-attempted questions, for such questions over and above eight. Though the directions clearly stated the above-mentioned marking scheme however within the paper it was showing zero as negative marking for set-based questions. We believe that it was an error and the marking scheme would remain as what was mentioned in the directions.

The section on General Knowledge did not have any negative marking and the marks scored in this section would be used for evaluation only after the initial screening — these will not be used for the shortlisting of candidates for the group discussion, written ability test round.

The verbal and logical ability section was a mixed bag of moderately easy/difficult and difficult questions. The vocab-based questions were not challenging. The RC passages were not difficult to follow and they were of shorter length than those of last year. But the RC questions involved a lot of critical thinking.

The VA segment had a total of 11 questions. Of the five critical reasoning (CR) questions, two could surely be attempted without going wrong.

Of the two para formation questions, one was easy (the answer options could be used to arrive at the right order) while the other had lengthy sentences and it was relatively challenging to spot the logical connections between the sentences. One of the two should have been surely attempted without going wrong.

Both the passages could be attempted with the help of the thought flow of the context itself without going wrong.

The CR questions tested the candidate on intent of the speaker, inferences and relationship between studies. These CR question types on the XAT resembled the GMAT CR question types.

There were four RC passages, each having three questions. There was a poem of having two questions. The poem posed an Inference question. The second question based on the poem was: Which will not serve as a title to the poem?

Three of the RC passages had mainly inference based questions and vocabulary based questions — explanation or implication of a term.

One of the passages sense of self had a further application question in addition to inference questions.

The cut-off in this section is expected to be around eight marks for XLRI Bm (male candidates). There were 21 questions in decision-making (DM) section, from seven sets — each set is of three questions.

The sets were simple and easy to comprehend. The easier part, however, ended there. The questions were subjective and the answers choices were not too easy to eliminate.

This year’s DM section is as difficult as it was last year. The questions that needed ranking the statements had very close choices. Careful reading was required for all the sets to avoid mistakes.

By spending about 30 to 35 minutes one would be able to attempt about 15 questions with 80 per cent accuracy.

We expect the cutoff in this section to be around eight marks for Bm programme.

The Quantitative Ability (QA) and Data Interpretation (DI) section had a mix of a few easy and mostly moderate-difficult questions. A few questions (the one on hare and tortoise, the one on time and work involving three persons, the question based on probability and a few questions from Geometry-Mensuration) turned out to be challenging and lengthy and required a thorough understanding of concepts.

In contrast to the last year, almost no question in this set required intensive calculations.

In a major departure from the pattern that XAT stuck to for the last many years, questions from Data Sufficiency (DS) were missing (test takers have become used to seeing two DS questions every year in the XAT) .

The section was similar in difficulty level compared to last year's QA-DI section, though the questions were definitely lengthier compared to last year. There were six questions from two DI sets. While the table-based set was very easy, the set involving countries and their GDP was time-consuming and had a strong flavour of reasoning too.

With the section being a notch lengthier, the number of attempts is bound to go down marginally.

The cut-off in this section for general category is expected to be around 11 marks for Bm. The section had mix of questions from areas like History, Geography, Sports, Business and Constitution.

As the section is not used for shortlisting, there will be no cut-off requirement for this section. However, those who attempted 12-13 with about 80 per cent accuracy can consider themselves to have done well.

202,08-1-20,‘Need to be trendy is the driving force’,"Budding designers must be taught the difference between inspiration and plagiarism, says Akshra Dalal

How the art and fashion industry has evolved in recent years?

Art and fashion are both creative domains and have always shared an intimate relationship. From Schiaparelli’s collaboration with Dali to Louis Vuitton’s Artycapucines Collection, Art has always served the purpose of inspiration for designers. Since art is a free form of expression it helps designers in pushing their boundaries as creative individual as there is a scope of exploration and novelty. From taking historical art movements and artists as inspirations to collaborating with young and independent artists, designers have come a long way and this amalgamation of two fields is only getting stronger by each passing day.

What are the challenges facing the industry in terms of skills needed?

Right now the industry is struggling to become a circular economy. The need to create environmentally conscious yet trendy designs is the driving force. But with fashion becoming more and more affordable and with increasing competition, industry does not need new designers they need thinkers and innovators who will help in making this industry a circular one.

What should the institutes do to make students job-ready?

Institutes should focus on quality over quantity. Value of hard work and positive attitude should be incorporated at early stages and so does the knowledge about copyright infringement and intellectual property rights. With social media and technology, we have access to each and every designers work but students must be taught to understand the difference between inspiration and plagiarism.

What are the skills that the industry is looking for today?

The industry currently is looking for people who can make a difference and multitask. Apart from an out of the box and lateral thinking towards problem, an eye for details, great artistic skills, knowledge about latest fashion trend and a general awareness about fashion and art industry is a must. Designers must develop unique skill sets to have a competitive edge over others. Designers who have innovative ideas to break away from the monotony and create something ecologically conscious as well, would have an edge over others.

Do we really need to put emphasis on theory in courses like fashion and art?

Theory is as important as the practical aspect in fashion and art or may be even more than practical. Introduction to the framework, conditions and tools they will be using within and in their interpretation is important.The goal of theory is to make them understand previous interpretations and criticism and to help them in thoughtful observations. When people look at a design or art they think about it and it becomes essential for them to know the concept and theories so they can put that work in context and explain their thoughts.

What are the future plans?

It all started with a dream, a vision to create a powerful student body, with exceptional skills to make their imagination come alive. Long term goals are to develop Indian design education to match growing industry needs and stay relevant in a dynamic global environment. In keeping with latest developments in global markets and societies we train students to design keeping in mind the three pillars of purposeful innovation, ethics and sustainability. We aim to strengthen it every year so our brand and our students are always on the cutting edge of change.

The goal is to always collaborate with like-minded educational partners in the world so our students widen their horizons and pursue truly international careers. We are proud to have kick-started this journey with KOEFIA, Rome, Italy followed by University of Arts, London. We have collaborated with London College of Fashion for a styling program and Chelsea College of Arts & Science as well.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---need-to-be-trendy-is-the-driving-force---.html

204,08-1-20,"Personally, I feel Tests should remain five-dayers: ICC cricket committee member Jayawardene","ICC Cricket Committee member Mahela Jayawardene on Wednesday said Tests should remain a five-day affair even though the body he is a part of, will discuss curtailing the format to four days in an upcoming meeting.

Former India captain Anil Kumble, who heads the cricket committee of the sport's governing body, has said that the proposal will be discussed in the next round of the ICC meetings, to held in Dubai from March 27-31.

Jayawardene, a former captain of Sri Lanka, said he is personally against any change in the Test format.

""We will discuss it in the meeting (in March, and I don't know what will happen after that but my personal opinion is that it should remain five days. I would not want any change,"" he told PTI.

The likes of Andrew Strauss, Rahul Dravid, and Shaun Pollock are also on the cricket committee.

The proposal, which has been floated for the 2023-2031 cycle, has not gone down well with the greats of the game, including Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting, opposing the idea.

However, member boards from England and Australia are open to the idea while BCCI boss Sourav Ganguly has said that ""it is too early"" to talk about it.

Ahead of the three-match T20 series opener against Sri Lanka in Guwahati last week, Kohli made his stance very clear on the subject.

""According to me, it should not be altered. As I said, the day-night is another step towards commercialising Test cricket and you know, creating excitement around it, but it can't be tinkered with too much,"" he had said.

""Then you are purely only talking about getting numbers, entertainment and you know. I think the intent will not be right then because then you will speak of three-day Tests. I mean where do you end. Then you will speak of Test cricket disappearing. So I don't endorse that at all.""

Leading Australia spinner Nathan Lyon has termed the idea ""ridiculous"".

More recently, Australian great Ponting expressed his disapproval of four-day Tests.

Among former players who want to see four-day Tests are Shane Warne, Mark Taylor and Michael Vaughan.

The ICC wants to try out four-day Tests primarily to free up space in the crowded calendar and use that time for the commercially lucrative shorter formats.

It is not a new phenomenon. England and Ireland played a four-day Test last year. South Africa and Zimbabwe too played one in 2017.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/personally--i-feel-tests-should-remain-five-dayers--icc-cricket-committee-member-jayawardene-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/personally--i-feel-tests-should-remain-five-dayers--icc-cricket-committee-member-jayawardene.html

On Tuesday, Rahul top-scored with a 32-ball 45 as India chased down the meagre target of 143 with utmost ease at the Holkar Stadium.

""Rahul is in unbelievable form. It amazes me every time I see Rahul bat that why didn't he play the same way in Test cricket,"" Gambhir told the host broadcasters.

""It's not about only white-ball cricket; it is about Test cricket too. He just got into a shell too much. With the kind of quality he posses, he is someone who can get you a 50-ball 100 in Test cricket as well. The kind of shots he has is superb,"" he added.

Shikhar Dhawan, who is making a return to the team after an injury lay-off, also contributed with a ""rusty"" 30-ball 32. Both Dhawan and Rahul are virtually playing for the second opener's slot for the World T20, with Rohit Sharma set to be one.

And Gambhir feels going by the current form, Rahul should be opening the batting alongside Rohit in Australia.

""You can't compare IPL to international cricket. When you're playing for Delhi Capitals, you know there's no one waiting for the opportunity, but when you're playing for the country and you know there's someone who's actually can replace you, there'll always be pressure. And today it was shown who's in better form,"" Gambhir said.

The cricketer-turned-politician, however, exuded confidence that Dhawan will bounce back strongly in the next game.

""Shikhar Dhawan looked rusty but it's a good thing that he got some runs under his belt. It will help him when he walks out to bat in the next game. Had he got out early, the pressure would have been more,"" he said.

India will play Sri Lanka in the final T20I in Pune on Friday before taking on Australia in a three-match ODI series beginning January 14 in Mumbai.

207,08-1-20,Iranian official: All on board Ukrainian plane killed,"A Ukrainian airplane carrying at least 170 people crashed on Wednesday shortly after takeoff from Tehran's main airport, killing all onboard, state TV reported.

The plane had taken off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in the Iranian capital. The crash is suspected to have been caused by mechanical issues, the TV reported, without elaborating.

An investigation team was at the site of the crash in southwestern outskirts of Tehran, civil aviation spokesman Reza Jafarzadeh said.

""After taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport, it crashed between Parand and Shahriar,"" Jafarzadeh said. ""An investigation team from the national aviation department was dispatched to the location after the news was announced.""

Pir Hossein Kulivand, an Iranian emergency official, later told state TV all those on board were killed in the crash. He said rescuers were trying to collect the dead.

State TV earlier said there were 180 passengers and crew aboard. The discrepancy could not be immediately reconciled.

Flight data from the airport showed a Ukrainian 737-800 flown by Ukraine International Airlines took off Wednesday morning, then stopped sending data almost immediately afterward, according to website FlightRadar24. The airline did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A photo later published by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency showed rescue officials in a farm field, with what appeared to be pieces of the aircraft laying nearby.

The crash came hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting two bases in Iraq housing U.S. Forces in retaliation for the killing of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

The Boeing 737-800 is a very common single-aisle, twin-engine jetliner used for short to medium-range flights. Thousands of the planes are used by airlines around the world.

Introduced in the late 1990s, it is an older model than the Boeing 737 MAX, which has been grounded for nearly 10 months following two deadly crashes.

A number of 737-800 aircraft have been involved in deadly accidents over the years.

In March 2016, a FlyDubai 737-800 from Dubai crashed while trying to land at Rostov-on-Don airport in Russia, killing 62 onboard. Another 737-800 flight from Dubai, operated by Air India Express, crashed in May 2010 while trying to land in Mangalore, India, killing more than 150 onboard.

Chicago-based Boeing Co was ""aware of the media reports out of Iran and we are gathering more information,"" spokesman Michael Friedman told The Associated Press. Boeing, like other airline manufacturers, typically assists in crash investigations. However, that effort in this case could be affected by the US sanctions campaign in place on Iran since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers in May 2018.

Both Airbus and Boeing had been in line to sell billions of dollars of aircraft to Iran over the deal, which saw Tehran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. But Trump's decision halted the sales.

Under decades of international sanctions, Iran's commercial passenger aircraft fleet has aged, with air accidents occurring regularly for domestic carriers in recent years, resulting in hundreds of casualties.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iranian-official--all-on-board-ukrainian-plane-killed-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/iranian-official--all-on-board-ukrainian-plane-killed.html
208,08-1-20,"'All is well,' says Trump after Iran missile attack","US President Donald Trump, in his first reaction after Iran's missile attack on two American bases in Iraq, insisted that ""all is well"" and promised to make a statement to the nation on Wednesday morning.

On Tuesday night, Iran launched over a dozen ballistic missiles targeting at least two bases where US military and coalition forces' are stationed in Iraq, the Pentagon said.

According to Iranian state TV, the attacks were in revenge for the killing of the commander of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards, General Qasem Soleimani, in a US drone strike on Friday, which was ordered by President Donald Trump.

Shortly after the missile attacks, Trump tweeted, ""All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good!""

He also promised to make a statement to the nation on Wednesday morning (local time).

""We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning,"" Trump tweeted.

Trump's tweet came after his reported meeting with his national security team, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark Esper.

Though there was no official confirmation of the meeting, Pompeo and Esper were seen entering the White House on late Tuesday night.

According to the White House, President Trump spoke with Qatar Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and thanked him for his country's strong partnership with the US. The two leaders discussed the situation in Iraq and Iran, as well as other critical bilateral and regional issues.

Trump also telephoned Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel and the two leaders discussed the security situation in the Middle East and Libya and agreed to continue close coordination moving forward, the White House said.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said Pompeo telephoned Kurdistan Regional Government Prime Minister Masrour Barzani and updated him on the Iranian missile attacks on Iraqi air bases, including in Erbil.

Meanwhile the Democratic party leadership continued to blame Trump for the escalating tensions in the Middle East.

""What's happening in Iraq and Iran today was predictable. Not exactly what's happening but the chaos that's ensuing,"" former US vice president Joe Biden said, blaming the situation on Trump's decisions of withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and ordering the missile strike in which Iranian general Soleimani was killed.

""Some of the things he's (Trump) done and said in the meantime have been close to ludicrous, including threatening to bomb holy sites...I just pray to God as he goes through what's happening, as we speak, that he's listening to his military commanders for the first time because so far that has not been the case,"" the Democratic presidential contender said.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she is closely monitoring the situation following the bombings targeting US troops in Iraq.

""We must ensure the safety of our service members, including ending needless provocations from the Administration and demanding that Iran cease its violence. America & world cannot afford war,"" she tweeted.

On Tuesday, Trump threatened Iran of dangerous consequences in the event of an attack from them.

""If Iran does anything that they shouldn't be doing, they are going to be suffering the consequences, and very strongly,"" he told reporters at the White House.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-all-is-well---says-trump-after-iran-missile-attack-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/-all-is-well---says-trump-after-iran-missile-attack.html

Officials said President Trump has been briefed and he is monitoring the situation.

""We are working on initial battle damage assessments,"" Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman said.

Hoffman said around 5:30 pm on January 7, ""Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against US.Military and coalition forces in Iraq"".

""It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting US military and coalition personnel at Al-Assad and Irbil,” he said.

White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said the President has been briefed about the situation.

“We are aware of the reports of attacks on US facilities in Iraq. The President has been briefed and is monitoring the situation closely and consulting with his national security team,” Grisham said.

Hoffman said in recent days and in response to Iranian threats and actions, the Department of Defence has taken all appropriate measures to safeguard its personnel and partners.

“These bases have been on high alert due to indications that the Iranian regime planned to attack our forces and interests in the region,” he said.

""As we evaluate the situation and our response, we will take all necessary measures to protect and defend US personnel, partners, and allies in the region,” Hoffman said.

211,08-1-20,Serena off to ‘solid’ start,"Serena Williams found her power game after a sluggish start as she overcame qualifier Camila Giorgi to open her 2020 season with a straight-sets victory at the Auckland WTA Classic on Tuesday.

With an eye on the Australian Open later in the month, the 38-year-old worked her way into a blistering performance that proved too much for the 1.7 metre (5ft 6in) Italian.

She described her first match since losing the US Open final in September as “solid” rather than spectacular.

“Spent a long time off from tournament play, match play, so solid is pretty good. It’s a great start to build on,” she said after sealing her 6-3, 6-2 victory with her eighth ace against the 99th-ranked Giorgi.

“It’s really good that I still have some power left in my arms and my legs.”

Williams said her preparation had been helped by playing doubles with Caroline Wozniacki the previous evening which allowed her to adapt to the blustery Auckland weather.

“I knew it was going to be really tough but I think the doubles really helped. I got to come out here and play a little bit in these conditions and get used to them.”

While Williams is the undisputed face of American tennis, she has been joined in Auckland by the new wave of US tennis stars, headed by the tournament third seed Amanda Anisimova who did not disappoint. The 18-year-old needed 78 minutes to dispose of Kateryna Kozlova of the Ukraine 6-3, 6-4.

The top five seeds were all in action on Tuesday and along with Williams and Anisimova, Petra Martic, defending champion Julia Goerges and Caroline Wozniacki also progressed to the second round.

Second seed Martic from Croatia had trouble at the start against 21-year-old American Usue Arconada and dropped the first set before prevailing 5-7, 6-4, 6-4.

Wozniacki cruised against New Zealander Paige Hourigan with a 6-1, 6-0 victory in 53 minutes while Germany’s Goerges came from 2-5 down in the second set to beat Greet Minnen of Belgium 6-1, 7-6 (7/4).",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/serena-off-to----solid----start.html
212,08-1-20,Smoke delays unlikely at Aus Open,"Smoke from bushfires is unlikely to delay the Australian Open tennis Grand Slam, organisers said on Tuesday, insisting they have pulled out all the stops to protect the health and safety of players.

With the opening major of 2020 due to start at January 20, Melbourne has been blanketed by haze in recent days from blazes burning to the east — part of Australia’s bushfire crisis.

Novak Djokovic, president of the ATP players council, said organisers should consider delaying the tournament, as a last resort, if conditions did not improve.

But Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley said he did not see this as likely. “There has been a lot of speculation about whether the smoke from the bushfires will affect the Australian Open,” he said.

“All the information we have at the moment, with qualifying coming up next week, is that the forecast is good, we don’t expect any delays and we’ve implemented additional measures to ensure the Australian Open will be able to run as scheduled.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/smoke-delays-unlikely-at-aus-open.html
213,08-1-20,Lukaku double keeps Inter top,"Romelu Lukaku scored twice as Inter Milan held on to top spot in Serie A on Monday with a 3-1 win over Napoli to keep the pressure on Juventus who earlier swept past Cagliari with Cristiano Ronaldo netting his first hat-trick in the Italian top flight.

Antonio Conte’s Inter ended their 23-year wait for a league win in Naples to stay in pole position, level on points with Juventus after 18 games, but ahead on goal difference.

Lazio are third, six points adrift but with a game in hand, after stretching their winning run in the league to nine matches on Sunday with a 2-1 victory over Brescia.

“It’s an important victory, winning away to Napoli is never easy,” said Conte after his 100th Serie A win as a coach but first in Naples.

“Napoli have in recent years always been behind Juventus, while Inter was a long way back. This year we have reduced the gap.”

Inter’s three goals all came from mistakes from Napoli, runners-up the past two seasons but only eighth this term.

Lukaku broke through on 14 minutes with a powerful solo run through the Napoli defence, with goalkeeper Alex Meret fumbling the second into goal in the 33rd minute.

Polish striker Arkadiusz Milik pulled a goal back for Napoli four minutes before the break.

But Lautaro Martinez added the third after the hour mark, following another mix-up in the Napoli defence, to give Inter their first win at the Stadio San Paolo since October 1997.

“We made lots of mistakes and scored three goals on our own,” said Napoli coach Gennaro Gattuso.

“The lads are worried because they are used to challenging for the Scudetto and this year it’s like this.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/lukaku-double-keeps-inter-top.html

215,08-1-20,‘Nothing tougher than playing India in India’,"Considered another Australian legend in making, young batsman Marnus Labuschagne is keen to test his skills against India, which he says is the toughest place to travel on a cricket assignment.

Labuschagne, 25, had a remarkable Test summer during which he scored four hundreds in five Tests, including a double century against New Zealand in the just-concluded third Test.

As the focus shifts from the red to white ball format, Labuchagne is gearing up for a tough test after being named in the Australian squad for the three-match series, starting January 14 in Mumbai.

“Whenever you play India, it’s a tough series because they’re a very tough opposition. They’ve got great batters and bowlers, so it’s going to be a challenge,” Labuschagne was quoted as saying by Cricket Australia website.

“But as a player you always want to test yourself against the best opposition in the toughest conditions, and there’s nothing tougher than India in India.”

Just 14 Tests old, Labuschagne is likely to claim the third position on the ICC Test rankings, behind India’s Virat Kohli and his compatriot Steve Smith.

He has already drawn comparisons with these modern-day greats but Labuschagne played down the plaudits.

“For people to speak like that is amazing, but there’s a lot more work to be done before anything like that can be talked about,” he said.

“Kane Williamson, Virat Kohli, Steve Smith — those guys have been doing it for five, six, seven years. To have one good summer doesn’t make you a great player. So for me it’s about trying to be consistent and trying to get Australia to win games.”

Labuschagne said competing in Sydney where conditions favoured spinners was a good preparation before the India tour.

“It’s probably good preparation coming from (playing on the SCG) going to India … that’s probably the closest we have in Australia to spinning conditions. But with the format change, and the wickets will be different.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---nothing-tougher-than-playing-india-in-india---.html

Rising player Lakshya went down to Denmark’s Hans-Kristian Solberg Vittinghus 21-11, 18-21, 14-21 in a hard-fought match in the men’s singles qualifiers that lasted 49 minutes.

Lakshya’s compatriot Shubhankar Dey also failed to make the men’s singles main draw after losing 15-21, 15-21 to Malaysia’s Liew Daren in the qualifiers of the Super 500 tournament.

The biggest upset of the day for India was the ouster of the world number 12 men’s doubles duo of Rankireddy and and Shetty, who fought hard before going down to world number 19 Ong Yew Sin and Teo Ee Yi of Malaysia.

The India duo lost 15-21, 21-18, 15-21 against the lower-ranked local pair in a first round duel that lasted 52 minutes.

It was a bad day in office for the Indians as the women’s doubles pair of Pooja Dandu and Sanjana Santosh also failed to make the main draw.

217,08-1-20,india go 1-0 up,"All-round bowling performance script Men in Blue’s 7-wicket win in 1st T20

All-round India ticked all the boxes on Jasprit Bumrah and Shikhar Dhawan’s return to international cricket and swept Sri Lanka aside by seven wickets to take 1-0 lead in the second T20 international at the Holkar Stadium on Tuesday.

The first match in Guwahati was called off without a ball being bowled due to rain and damp pitch. Virat Kohli and his boys will now look to seal the series in the final match of the series in Pune on Friday.

Chasing a reasonable 143 for victory, Kohli (30 not out) smashed a six in the 18th over to seal the deal for the rampaging hosts with 15 balls to spare.

KL Rahul scored 45, Shreyas Iyer got 34 and the returning Shikhar Dhawan made 32 as India never really looked in any sort of trouble after their bowlers fired in unison to keep the Lankans in check.

The two openers, vying for the second opener’s slot along with Rohit Sharma for the World T20 later this year, got India off to a solid start. Rahul looked good, hitting six fours before his ambition got the better of him as leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga cleaned him up with a delivery wide of the crease in the 10th over.

Dhawan followed suit soon, trapped in front by Hasaranga which was confirmed by a successful review after the umpire ruled the southpaw not out.

Shreyas Iyer, promoted to No 3, and Virat Kohli then made short work of the remaining runs as the former took 17 off Hasaranga in the 16th over with the latter hitting Sri Lanka skipper Lasith Malinga for 16 in the next over.

Iyer was caught by Dasun Shanaka at square-leg off Lahiru Kumara, but it was all over for Sri Lanka by then as Kohli whipped a six over long leg off Kumara to win it in style with Rishabh Pant (1 not out) at the other end.

Earlier, the bowlers put up a good show with Navdeep Saini shining bright as India restricted Sri Lanka to 142/9. All eyes were on the returning Bumrah after India captain Virat Kohli decided to field first.

Bumrah, who has been out of action after India’s tour of the West Indies in July-August last year due to a stress fracture on his back, started off with a wide in the first ball of the match and was hit for a four in the second as he finished conceding seven runs.

Danushka Gunathilaka and Avishka Fernando hit boundaries off him in the fourth over as India’s premier pacer looked a bit rusty starting off, but in the end bowled a superbly disguised slower to castle Dasun Shanaka in the 17th over.

Bumrah was taken for 12 in the final over by Wanindu Hasaranga (16 not out) who hit a hat-trick of fours to end the innings with a flourish as the fast bowler returned figures of 1/31 in his four overs.

Shardul Thakur (3/23) was the pick of the bowlers for the hosts but it was Saini (2/18) who impressed the most while Kuldeep Yadav (2/38) also picked up two wickets.

For the Lankans, Kusal Perera top-scored with a 28-ball 34 (6x3).

The Sri Lanka openers looked good against India’s pace trio of Bumrah, Shardul and Saini before Kohli went to Washington Sundar (1/29) and the spinner did the trick as Fernando (22) hit straight to mid-off where Saini took a simple catch.

Sri Lanka raced to 48/1 after six overs but just as Gunathilaka was looking good, thumping Shardul Thakur for a four down mid-off in the sixth over, a Navdeep Saini thunderbolt at 147.5 kph beat him all ends up to rattle the stumps. He was gone for 20.

In-form Perera welcomed Kuldeep with a six over deep midwicket in the 12th over. But the chinaman, who recently became the first Indian to take two hat-tricks in international cricket, had the last laugh as he got Oshada Fernando (10) stumped in the third ball of the same over.

In the last five overs, the visitors managed just 34 runs, losing four wickets as Shardul picked up three in quick succession.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-go-1-0-up-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-go-1-0-up.html

223,08-1-20,Iraq says Iran informed it of imminent missile attack on US forces,"Iraq's prime minister's office said Wednesday it had received ""an official verbal message"" from Iran informing it that a missile attack on US forces stationed on Iraqi soil was imminent.

Iran launched 22 missiles at Iraqi bases housing US and other coalition troops early Wednesday in response to the killing of senior Revolution Guards commander Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad last week.

In its first statement hours later, premier Adel Abdel Mahdi's office said it had been warned.

""We received an official verbal message from the Islamic Republic of Iran that the Iranian response to the assassination of Qasem Soleimani had begun or would begin shortly, and that the strike would be limited to where the US military was located in Iraq without specifying the locations,"" it said.

The prime minister's office said it was simultaneously contacted by the US, as the missiles slammed into the Ain al-Asad base in western Iraq and Harir further north.

""We immediately warned Iraqi military commanders to take the necessary precautions,"" it said, adding that no Iraqi forces had been hurt in the attack.

""Iraq rejects any violation of its sovereignty and attacks on its territory,"" the premier's office added, without specifically condemning the missile strikes.

It said Abdel Mahdi was in talks with domestic and foreign partners to prevent an ""open war."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier said he had spoken to Masrour Barzani, the prime minister of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.

But it remained unclear if there was any contact between Pompeo or any other top US official and Abdel Mahdi.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iraq-says-iran-informed-it-of-imminent-missile-attack-on-us-forces-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/iraq-says-iran-informed-it-of-imminent-missile-attack-on-us-forces.html

225,08-1-20,3 days after JNU violence no arrest yet; Centre says police get vital clues on masked assailants,"The Delhi Police was yet to make any arrest three days after the attack on students and teachers of the JNU even as the Centre said on Wednesday that the police got vital clues about the identities of the masked assailants and is on the verge of cracking the case.

As JNU Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar continued to face criticism for not taking immediate measures when violence broke out on the JNU campus on Sunday evening, he was advised by the Human Resources Development (HRD) Ministry to take steps to restore normalcy.

Kumar was also urged by the ministry officials during a meeting to be more communicative with students and the faculty and to take them into confidence and facilitate the semester registration process.

With a breakthrough elusive, government sources said the Delhi Police has obtained vital leads and a lot of positive efforts were going on for the identification of the masked people who were seen indulging in the violence on Jawaharlal Nehru University(JNU) campus.

The sources said police personnel were on ""extra alert"" on Wednesday following mobilisation of students and teachers on the campus.

The situation on the campus remained tense amid heavy police deployment even as several students continue to stay off-campus after the Sunday violence. Only students with valid identification card are being allowed inside the campus.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southwest) Devender Arya said the situation in JNU is under control. ""At the request of JNU administration, the police presence will continue,"" he added.

As the demand for Kumar's resignation grew louder, JNU Teachers' Association(JNUTA) said the attack on the campus could not have been possible without the connivance of the varsity administration and deliberate inaction by police. It also slammed Kumar for asking students to put the past behind and return to the varsity premises.

Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram took a dig at Kumar, saying he should take his own advice of putting the past behind and leave the university.

""Higher Education Secretary Amit Khare and G C Hosur had a meeting with JNU VC at the ministry today about the efforts being made to restore normalcy on campus. He informed the officials about efforts being made for facilitating semester registration for willing students and a conducive environment for their academic pursuits,"" a HRD ministry official said.

On Sunday, a mob of masked men stormed the campus and targeted students in three hostels, unleashing mayhem with sticks, stones and iron rods, hitting inmates and breaking windows, furniture and personal belongings.

Police officials also said they have received 11 complaints, including one lodged by a professor in connection with the violence.

The police has come under attack for not acting when the mob was running riot on the campus, and especially for naming student union leaders, including JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh in the two FIRs related to vandalism on the campus. No one has been named as an accused in the case.

Following this, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury alleged the Delhi Police was a ""puppet"" of the Modi government and demanded a court-monitored probe into the JNU violence, saying a ""pre-judged"" police inquiry has no ""credibility"".

The Congress said it was the ""new normal"" in the country with the victim being named rather than the perpetrator.

On Wednesday, political leaders and activists continued to flock to the university campus to express solidarity with the students.

DMK leader and party MP M Kanimozhi interacted with university students, including Aishe Ghosh.

""The entire country is with you. Don't lose heart. There are many people who have condemned it... We will raise the issue. We will fight for you,"" she told the students.

A fact finding committee of the Congress comprising India Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev, party MP from Ernakulam Hibi Eden, former NSUI president of JNU unit Syed Nasser Hussain and former NSUI president and ex-president of Delhi University Students' Union Amrita Dhawan interacted with students on the issue. Statements of students were video-graphed.

Dev slammed the HRD Ministry and the Delhi government for not sending a fact finding committee even to talk to the students who faced the attack.

There was also a war of words over actress Deepika Padukone going to the JNU to express solidarity with the students on Tuesday.

On one hand, there were calls to boycott her upcoming movie 'Chhapaak', while on the other several lauded her move to back JNU students.

Amid calls, including from some BJP functionaries, to boycott the movie, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said not just artistes, even a common man can go anywhere to express their opinion in a democracy like India.

Outside the campus, support grew louder for the JNU students.

The Delhi University Coordination Committee took out a march to express solidarity with the JNU students and against alleged police inaction.

The students at St. Stephen College also boycotted classes in solidarity with the JNU students and in protest against the amended citizenship law.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/3-days-after-jnu-violence-no-arrest-yet--centre-says-police-get-vital-clues-on-masked-assailants-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/3-days-after-jnu-violence-no-arrest-yet--centre-says-police-get-vital-clues-on-masked-assailants.html

228,08-1-20,Sporadic incidents violence across Bengal as strikers try to Enforce bandh,"Sporadic incidents of violence were reported from various parts of West Bengal on Wednesday as trade union activists backed by Left and Congress members tried to enforce the 24-hour strike against the Centre's ""anti people"" policies.

The strikers blocked rail and roads in several parts of the state affecting normal life.

They burnt tyres and blocked roads in various parts of the East Burdwan district, besides staging sit-in on railway tracks, affecting train services in the sector.

In East Midnapore district, stones were hurled at buses. When police tried to remove protesters, a scuffle ensued, following which several strikers were arrested, the police said.

The protesters tried to break past barricades in Kolkata's Jadavpur and Central Avenue areas, promoting police to use of force. Several strikers were held, they said.

In Dum Dum and Lake Town areas, clashes broke out between Left supporters, who took out rallies in support of the strike, and TMC supporters who were opposing it. A huge police contingent was rushed to the spot to control the situation, the police said.

Country-made bombs were found on various roads in Barasat area of the North 24 Paraganas district, they said.

The strikers also took out rallies in the industrial belt of the district and blocked roads and railway tracks. But police removed them to ensure movement of vehicles without hitch.

Daily commuters and office-goers across the state had a harrowing experience as the number of vehicles plying on the roads was much less than other days.

In Kolkata, government buses were plying normally but the number of private buses was less. Metro services were normal in the city and auto-rickshaws and taxis were also seen on the roads.

Heavy police deployment was seen in several areas of the city, including in Tollygunge, Behala, Esplanade and Jadavpur.

The Trinamool Congress also took out rallies opposing the strike at some places in north Bengal and urged people to maintain normalcy.

The strike has been called by trade unions INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC, along with various sectoral independent federations and associations.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sporadic-incidents-violence-across-bengal-as-strikers-try-to-enforce-bandh-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sporadic-incidents-violence-across-bengal-as-strikers-try-to-enforce-bandh.html
229,08-1-20,Ready to hang Nirbhaya case convicts; will bring 'great relief' to me: Meerut hangman,"Hangman Pawan Jallad, who officials say is being considered to carry out the execution of the four Nirbhaya gangrape case convicts, says he is ready for the job which will send out a strong message in the society.

He said executing those who were involved in the horrific crime will bring ""great relief"" to him, Nirbhaya's parents and everybody else.

A Delhi court on Tuesday issued death warrants against all the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape-murder case and ordered that they be hanged on January 22 at 7 am in Tihar jail.

The death warrant, also known as black warrant, addressed to the office of the Tihar jail chief, was issued by Additional Sessions Judge Satish Kumar Arora against Mukesh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).

""I do not have any information regarding the execution, nobody has spoken to me yet. If anyone approaches me, I am ready to do the job. Earlier, I was asked to be ready for the execution on December 16,"" Pawan Jallad told reporters here.

""Those who were involved in this brutal incident must be hanged, which will send out a strong message in the society,"" he said.

""Hanging the Nirbhaya gangrape case convicts will certainly bring great relief to me, her parents and everybody else,"" he added.

Nirbhaya, a 23-year-old paramedic student, was gangraped and brutalised on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, inside a moving bus in south Delhi by the four men, along with two others, before being dumped on the road.

She died on December 29, 2012, at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

Of the six persons convicted, one allegedly committed suicide in jail and another, a juvenile, was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

When contacted, Jail Superintendent of Meerut prison V P Pandey said he has not yet received any letter from Tihar authorities.

""Last month, we had received a letter asking us to keep Pawan Jallad ready but there is no fresh communication. The Delhi court warrants were issued this evening, maybe we will get the letter for sending him by tomorrow (Wednesday),"" he said.

The gangrape of the 23-year-old, who came to be known as 'Nirbhaya', the fearless one, sparked outrage across the country. Repulsed, people took to the streets across the country, demanding justice for her and better safety measures for women.

The case led to toughening of India's rape laws.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ready-to-hang-nirbhaya-case-convicts--will-bring--great-relief--to-me--meerut-hangman-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/ready-to-hang-nirbhaya-case-convicts--will-bring--great-relief--to-me--meerut-hangman.html

236,08-1-20,"Aspirin may curb colorectal cancer recurrence, tumour growth","The benefits of a daily aspirin may extend beyond heart health to colorectal cancer treatment, say researchers, adding that they have found that aspirin appears to reduce tumour growth and inhibit recurrence of the disease.

The trick now is to determine the right dosage of aspirin that can be used as a daily prophylactic without triggering dangerous side effects such as stomach and brain bleeds, the research said.

""Some might say aspirin is a 'miracle drug' because of its potential to prevent diseases that result from chronic inflammation, such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and arthritis,"" said Indian-origin study researhcher Ajay Goel from the City of Hope clinic in the US.

The reason aspirin isn't currently being used to prevent these diseases is because taking too much of any anti-inflammatory eats at the stomach's mucus lining and causes gastrointestinal and other problems.

""We are getting closer to discovering the right amount of daily aspirin needed to treat and prevent colorectal cancer without causing scary side effects,"" Goel added.

The study, published in the journal Carcinogenesis, used mouse models and mathematical modeling to parallel the amount of daily aspirin people in the US and Europe are taking in clinical trials.

The research team tested three varying daily doses of aspirin in four colorectal cancer cell lines, including tumours with microsatellite instability and mutations in the PIK3CA gene, which has been tied to increased risk of endometrial, colon and aggressive breast cancers.

Then the researchers divided 432 mice into four groups: control, low-dose aspirin (15mg/kg), medium-dose aspirin (50mg/kg) and high-dose aspirin (100mg/kg) -- the mouse equivalent of 100mg, 300mg and 600mg for humans.

The tumours from three mice in each treatment group were analysed on days three, five, seven, nine and 11.

Researchers inspected ""cellular apoptosis"" (programmed cell death) and found that the percentage of cells programmed to die increased in all cell lines.

Exactly how much, however, depended on the amount of aspirin that was consumed, suggesting that aspirin triggers a domino effect of cell death in all colorectal cell lines regardless of genetic background.

The research found that as the aspirin doses increased, the rate of cell death increased while the division rates of cells decreased, meaning tumour cells were more likely to die and not proliferate.

Notably, the scientists observed that low-dose aspirin was especially effective in suppressing tumour growth in animal models that had more PIK3CA genes.

The finding was significant because the mutated version of these genes has been associated with increased risk of certain cancers, the researchers said.

""We are now working with some of the people conducting those human clinical trials to analyse data and use mathematical modelling. This process adds a layer of confidence to the findings and guides future human trial designs,"" Goel said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aspirin-may-curb-colorectal-cancer-recurrence--tumour-growth-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/aspirin-may-curb-colorectal-cancer-recurrence--tumour-growth.html
237,08-1-20,Want to control diabetes? Ketone drinks may help,"With more people with diabetes and pre-diabetes looking for strategies to help control blood sugar, new study suggests that ketone monoester drinks--a new food supplement--may help to do it.

""There is mounting evidence that a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet is very effective in controlling blood sugar and even reversing Type 2 diabetes,"" said study lead author Jonathan Little, Associate Professor at University of British Columbia in Canada.

""We wanted to know what would happen if artificial ketones were given to those with obesity and at risk for Type 2 diabetes but who haven't been dieting,"" Little added.

Type 2 diabetes is a disease whereby the body is unable to control the level of sugar in the blood because defects in the functioning of a hormone called insulin.

""It's a disease that's becoming alarmingly common in Canada and approaching what many would consider epidemic levels,"" Little said.

""While Type 2 diabetes can be controlled with medications or injectable insulin, many people are looking to options that don't require taking pills every day or that are less invasive,"" he added.

According to the study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Ketone supplements are proving fertile ground for research into Type 2 diabetes because ketones are the natural fuel source of the body when it's in ketosis--the metabolic byproduct of consuming a low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet.

To test the idea, the research team asked 15 people to consume a ketone drink after fasting overnight.

After 30 minutes, they were then asked to drink a fluid containing 75 grams of sugar while blood samples were taken.

""It turns out that the ketone drink seemed to launch participants into a sort of pseudo-ketogenic state where they were better able to control their blood sugar levels with no changes to their insulin,"" Little explained.

""It demonstrates that these supplements may have real potential as a valuable tool for those with Type 2 diabetes,"" he said.

""There are a number of problems that we still have to work out, including the fact that we still don't know what the long-term effects of consuming ketones are,"" he added.

241,08-1-20,Nirbhaya’s rapists to get just deserts on Jan 22,"4 convicts break down after death warrant; Nirbhaya’s parents satisfied with justice

The rapists and killers of 23-year-old paramedic Nirbhaya will be hanged on January 22 at 7 am in Jail number 3 in Tihar. Three of the convicts are lodged in Jail number 2, while one is in Jail number 4, the official said. The much awaited verdict was delivered on Tuesday by the trial court as the Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) issued the death warrant against the convicts on the death row.

The issuance of the death warrant against the four convicts Mukesh Singh, (32), Pawan Gupta, (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) evoked emotional response from Nirbhaya’s parents who have been waiting for the last seven years to see justice for their daughter.

As soon as the judge signed the death warrant, all the four convicts broke down in jail.

However, the process of executing them could be delayed as the convicts have 14 days to use their final legal options. “They will be kept in separate cells in solitary confinement and will be allowed one last meeting with their families,” said a jail official.

Nirbhaya’a mother Asha Devi and her father, who have waged a relentless battle to see that the rapists and murderers of her daughter are punished, appeared satisfied after the judge reading the final verdict on the brutal gangrape that had outraged the country.

“This judgment will reinforce people’s faith in the judiciary and empower women. My daughter will get justice,” said Nirbhaya’s mother.

Nirbhaya, who was pursuing Bachelor of Physiotherapy and was named as “Nirbhaya (fearless)”, had died 13 days after she was brutally gangraped on a moving bus by six men, including a juvenile who is now free.

She was subjected to the most inhuman torture with her rapists inserting iron rod in her private parts and then throwing Nirbhaya and her male friend on the road from the moving bus. She and her friend had boarded the bus from South Delhi after a watching movie.

She was found naked and bleeding on the chilly night of December 16, 2012. She died on December 29, 2012, at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

The sheer brutality inflicted on her by the rapists had created ripples across the country and became a turning point for laws to ensure safety of women. Then Manmoahn Singh-led Union Government had set up a commission headed by former Chief Justice of India JS Verma, who suggested many changes in the laws.

Just before the death warrant, the mother of convict Mukesh had walked up to Nirbhaya’s mother and pleaded with her. “I appeal to you to forgive my son. I am begging for his life,” she said, holding her sari before her in a gesture of begging. “I had a daughter too. How can I forget what happened with her? I have been waiting for justice for seven years,” Nirbhaya’s mother responded.

During the hearing, the prosecution said there was no application pending before any court or the President right now by any of the convicts and the review petition of all the convicts was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

On July 9 last year, the apex court had dismissed the review pleas filed by the other three convicts in the case, saying no grounds have been made out by them for review of the 2017 verdict.

While urging the court to issue the death warrants, the prosecution said, “In between the issuance and the execution of death warrants, if the convicts want to file curative petitions, they can do so.”

The counsel for two of the convicts - Mukesh and Vinay - said they were in the process of filing curative petition in the Supreme Court.

When the hearing commenced, advocate ML Sharma appeared before the court and said he is representing Mukesh.

However, amicus curiae Vrinda Grover, who on the last date was appointed by the court to represent Mukesh, said Sharma had no authority to represent him.

The court heard the arguments from both of them and directed Sharma to produce Vakalatnama (document empowering lawyer) showing that Mukesh authorised him.

After the court reserved the order for 3.30 pm on issuance of death warrants, Mukesh’s mother entered the court room crying and urged the court to show mercy.

The court refused to entertain her. Talking to media persons outside the courtroom, she said her son was framed because he is poor. The court interacted with all the convicts through video conferencing from Tihar jail. The media was not allowed inside the video conferencing room.

After the court passed the order, the lawyers and family members of the convicts came out and informed the media about court’s order.

It may be noted that the trial court had earlier directed Tihar jail authorities to seek within a week response from the four death row convicts as to whether they were filing mercy pleas against their executions with the President of India.

It was hearing the applications moved by Nirbhaya’s parents and the prosecution (Delhi Government) seeking issuance of death warrant against the convict.

The Supreme Court on December 18 had dismissed the plea of Akshay seeking review of its decision, saying review petition is not “re-hearing of appeal over and over again” and it had already considered the mitigating and aggravating circumstances while upholding the death penalty.

One of the six accused in the case, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail here. A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

The top court in its 2017 verdict had upheld the capital punishment awarded to them by the Delhi High Court and the trial court.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya---s-rapists-to-get-just-deserts-on-jan-22-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nirbhaya---s-rapists-to-get-just-deserts-on-jan-22.html
242,08-1-20,First execution of quartet in Tihar,"The horrific December 16, 2012 Nirbhaya rape-murder case transformed much in India. From laws on rape to relief and rehabilitation measures for rape survivors and the very mindset of the people, everything went for a sea change.

But as the case reaches its inevitable end with the issuance of warrants for the hanging of the four convicts on January 22, the execution chamber of Tihar Jail will also see a major change.

For this, it is necessary to revisit the previous few decades, back to the 1970s, when towards the end of that tumultuous decade, the kidnapping and brutal murder of the teenage Chopra children (Geeta and her brother Sanjay) in August 1978 had shook the nation, and the then Janata Party Government of Prime Minister Morarji Desai. The two convicts, Kuljit Singh, alias Ranga, and Jasbir Singh, alias Billa, were caught soon after their dastardly crime and were hanged to death in Tihar in 1982.

After them, the executions of Kartar Singh and Ujagar Singh, the convicts in India’s purported contract killing — the sensational Vidya Jain murder of 1973 (1983), Kashmiri militant Maqbool Bhat (1984), Indira Gandhi’s assassin Satwant Singh and conspirator Kehar Singh (1989), and finally 2001 Parliament attack case conspirator Afzal Guru (2013) have been the eight people who have undergone capital punishment in Tihar’s gallows court.

While three of the executions were double, the Nirbhaya convicts’ execution will be the first time that Tihar Jail has been directed by a court to execute the death penalty on four people.

The 23-year-old woman was brutally gang-raped and tortured on December 16, 2012, which led to her death. Six accused were arrested and charged with sexual assault and murder. One of the accused was a minor and appeared before a juvenile justice court, while another accused allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail.

The four were convicted and sentenced on the basis of the testimony of the sole eyewitness, the victim’s friend, who was badly injured in the incident, and the painstaking police probe that followed.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/first-execution-of-quartet-in-tihar-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/first-execution-of-quartet-in-tihar.html
243,08-1-20,Jallad from Meerut to hang convicts with Buxar ropes,"The four convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape case will be executed in Jail No 3, a senior Tihar Jail official said on Tuesday, hours after a Delhi court issued death warrants against them and declared that they will be hanged at 7 am on January 22.

According to the official, ropes which will be used for hanging them will be brought from Bihar’s Buxar Jail. He said the prison authorities are waiting to receive the court order. Three of the convicts are lodged in Jail No 2, while one is in Jail No 4, the official said. Sources said the jail authorities will approach the Uttar Pradesh prison authority asking for a hangman from Meerut to carry out the executions.

The four convicts — Mukesh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) — will be kept in isolated cells and will not be allowed to interact with other prisoners. Their family members, however, can visit them any time, the official said.

The safety of the convicts will be taken care of by the prison authorities and doctors will conduct regular check-ups to keep a check on their physical and mental health, he added.

Asked if the four would be hanged together, he said “it is possible”. Nirbhaya, a 23-year-old paramedic student, was gangraped and brutalised on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, inside a moving bus in south Delhi by the four men, including two others, before being dumped on the road. She died on December 29, 2012, at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

Of the six persons convicted, one allegedly committed suicide in jail and another, a juvenile, was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term. Mukesh, Pawan, Vinay and Akshay can still move a curative petition before the top court. With no hangman in Tihar, the sources said, the Tihar authorities will again write to the prison authority of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh to provide a hangman. “We had earlier written to the prison authority of Uttar Pradesh seeking services of a hangman from Meerut. Now that the death warrant has been issued, we will be writing to the prison authority again, seeking the services of a hangman,” they said.

When contacted, Jail Superintendent of Meerut prison VP Pandey said he has not received any letter for sending a hangman for carrying out the executions. “Last month, we got a letter to keep Pawan Jallad ready but there is no fresh communication. The Delhi court warrants were issued only this evening, maybe we will get the letter for sending him tomorrow (Tuesday),” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/jallad-from-meerut-to-hang-convicts-with-buxar-ropes.html
244,08-1-20,"HRD Min hails Jamia V-C for tact, seeks explanation from JNU V-C","Observing that Jamia Millia Islamia Vice-Chancellor Najma Akhtar handled a more explosive situation on her campus in a far better way than Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) V-C Jagadesh, the HRD Ministry on Tuesday sought explanation from him for his failure to control the disturbances on the campus.

The HRD Ministry, which is preparing a detailed report to send to the Home Ministry on Sunday’s violence on the prestigious university campus, has summoned the JNU V-C again on Wednesday. The V-C had skipped a high-level meeting convened by the Ministry on Monday.

In its preliminary report, the Ministry has said the JNU administration needed to be more sensitive towards the students and conveyed its displeasure at the handling of the incident by the university administration. After the violence on the campus there has been a demand from several quarters, including the students and faculty members, for the removal of the JNU V-C.

JNU Pro-Vice Chancellor, Registrar Pramod Kumar, Rector Rana Pratap Singh and Proctor Dhananjay Singh had a meeting with HRD Ministry Secretary Amit Khare on Monday.

Condemning the mob violence on the campus that left 34 people injured, the Ministry in a note on Tuesday observed that police investigation should go on, however, the students should not feel threatened.

“The Government is of the view that students shouldn’t be worried about facing disciplinary action from the administration such as rustications and harassment. The Ministry is of the view that the university should bring down the tension on the campus.

The Ministry has also said that it does not want the university to shut down and the administration should be sensitive towards the students as the administration has not met students who were injured,” the source quoted the initial report.

Simultaneously, the HRD Ministry has observed that Jamia Millia University Vice-Chancellor Najma Akhtar handled the incident of violence inside the campus far better than the JNU administration. The note appreciated that Jamia administration on its own rushed to the HRD Ministry and apprised the situation and then kept on informing about each development within the campus that witnessed violence in protest against the Centre’s Citizen’s Amendment Act (CAA) and National Population Register (NPR).

Under fire from students and faculty members for not doing enough when they were brutally attacked by a masked mob on campus, Mamidala urged the students on Tuesday to put the past behind and return to the university premises. In a brief statement, the JNU V-C said, “Our heart goes out to all injured students. The incident (violence) is unfortunate. I would like to tell students that JNU campus is a secure place. I urge all students to come back to the campus. Let us put the past behind.”

Later interacting with reporters, the V-C said the campus has its own security. “If there is a law and order situation we do not rush to the police immediately. We see if our security can handle it. The campus has its own security. On Sunday, when we saw that there is a possibility of aggressive behaviour among students, we informed the police,” he said.

JNU Professor Sucharita Sen, who suffered head injuries during the attack on students and teachers, has filed a police complaint. Sen said outsiders had gathered on the university campus with sticks, rods, and deadly weapons. She said she was first hit with a large stone on her shoulder and then with even a larger one on her head, following which she fell on the ground bleeding profusely.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/hrd-min-hails-jamia-v-c-for-tact--seeks-explanation-from-jnu-v-c.html
245,08-1-20,"Nationwide bandh by trade unions today, Centre warns action","Public sector banks, transport, Government offices in Opposition-ruled States and other services across the country are likely to be hit as several mainstream trade unions have called a nationwide strike on Wednesday. The Government has warned of stern action against strikers.

Ten Central trade unions — INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC — along with various independent federations, associations and Left-wing Government employees’ unions had adopted a declaration in September last to go on a nationwide strike on January 8, 2020 against “anti-people” polices of the Government.

Sangh Parivar-supported BMS is not participating in the strike led by Left and Congress supported-trade unions. In a stern warning, the Ministry of Personnel said, “Any employee going on strike in any form would face the consequences which, besides deduction of wages, may also include appropriate disciplinary action.”

Several PSU banks have informed stock exchanges about the strike and its impact on banking services.

Various bank employee associations, including CPI and CPI(M)-supported AIBEA, All India Bank Officers’ Association (AIBOA), BEFI, and Congress-supported INBEF and INBOC and Bank Karmachari Sena Mahasangh (BKSM), have expressed their willingness to participate in the strike.

Banking services like deposit and withdrawal, cheque clearing and instrument issuance are expected to be impacted due to the strike. Bank managements have clarified that the internet-based and ATM operations will not be affected by the strike. However, services at private sector banks are unlikely to be impacted.

Other than banking, insurance, transport and other key services are also likely to be disrupted in many States due to this nationwide strike call. In Left parties dominated Kerala, the strike is expected to be total and normal life will be paralysed. In West Bengal, trade unions affiliated to Left and other parties called for a bandh against the economic policies of the BJP-led Government at the Centre. However, the Trinamool Congress-led State Government said it will not support any bandh.

The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday directed the West Bengal Government to take necessary steps for ensuring law and order in the State in view of a nationwide strike. The High Court was hearing a PIL moved by a practising lawyer seeking a direction to the State Government to make sure that there is no disruption of normal life during the strike. A division bench comprising Chief Justice TBN Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee also directed the administration to ensure that examinations in colleges and competitive tests are not hampered owing to the strike.

“The Ministry of Labour has failed to assure on any of the demands of workers which called a meeting on January 2, 2020. The attitude of the Government is that of contempt towards labour as we construe from its policies and actions,” the 10 Central trade unions said in a joint statement.

“We expect participation of not less than 25 crore of working people in the forthcoming National General Strike on January 8, 2020, to be followed by many more actions seeking reversal of the anti-worker, anti-people, anti-national policies of the Government,” it said. The Central Government, meanwhile, has asked public sector undertakings to dissuade their employees from participating in the ‘Bharat Bandh’ called on Wednesday and advised them to prepare a contingency plan to ensure smooth functioning of the enterprises.

Meanwhile, in Kerala, the trade unions exempted the State’s tourism sector from Wednesday’s general strike. Kerala Travel Mart (KTM) Society hailed as “exemplary” the decision by political parties and trade unions to exempt the State’s tourism sector from Wednesday’s general strike.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nationwide-bandh-by-trade-unions-today--centre-warns-action.html

247,08-1-20,Iran Gen’s burial procession proves last journey for 56,"A stampede broke out on Tuesday at a funeral for a top Iranian general killed in a US airstrike, and at least 56 people were killed and more than 200 were injured as thousands thronged the procession, two Iranian news agencies reported.

The stampede took place in Kerman, the hometown of Revolutionary Guard Major General Qassem Soleimani, as the procession began, said the semi-official Fars and

ISNA news agencies, citing Pirhossein Koulivand, head of Iran’s emergency medical services.

There was no information as to what had set off the stampede. Online videos showed people lying apparently lifeless, their faces covered by clothing. Emergency crews performed CPR on others as people wailed in the background, crying out to God.

“Unfortunately as a result of the stampede, some of our compatriots have been injured and some have been killed during the funeral processions,” Koulivand said. The news agencies gave the death toll of 40, with 213 injured.

Soleimani’s burial was later delayed, with no new time given. Authorities cited concerns about the massive crowd that had gathered as a reason for the delay, the semi-official ISNA news agency said.

A procession in Tehran on Monday drew over 1 million people in the Iranian capital, crowding both main thoroughfares and side streets in Tehran. Such mass crowds can prove dangerous. A similar stampede, though on a much smaller scale, struck the 1989 funeral procession for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, killing at least eight people and injuring hundreds.

Soleimani’s death in a drone strike on Friday has sparked calls across Iran for revenge against America, drastically raising tensions across West Asia. The US warned ships of an unspecified threat from Iran across the region’s waterways, crucial routes for global energy supplies.

Meanwhile, the US Air Force launched a drill with 52 fighter jets in Utah, just days after President Donald Trump threatened to hit 52 sites in Iran.

Earlier in the day, Hossein Salami, the new leader of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, vowed to avenge Soleimani’s death as he addressed a crowd of supporters gathered at the coffin in a central square in Kernan.

“We tell our enemies that we will retaliate but if they take another action we will set ablaze the places that they like and are passionate about,” Salami said.

“Death to Israel!” the crowd shouted in response. Israel is a longtime regional foe of Iran.

The funeral processions in major cities over three days have been an unprecedented honor for Soleimani, viewed by Iranians as a national hero for his work leading the Guard’s expeditionary Quds Force.

The U.S. blames him for killing U.S. troops in Iraq and accused him of plotting new attacks just before he was killed in the drone strike near Baghdad’s airport. Soleimani also led forces supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad in that country’s civil war, and he also served as the point man for Iranian proxies in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.

His slaying already has pushed Tehran to abandon the remaining limits of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers as his successor and others vow to take revenge. In Baghdad, the parliament has called for the expulsion of all American troops from Iraqi soil, something analysts fear could allow Islamic State militants to mount a comeback.

In his eulogy to the crowd, Salami praised Soleimani’s work, describing him as essential to backing Palestinian groups, Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria. As a martyr, Soleimani represented an even greater threat to Iran’s enemies, Salami said.

According to a report on Tuesday by the semi-official Tasnim news agency, Iran has worked up 13 sets of plans for revenge for Soleimani’s killing. The report quoted Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, as saying that even the weakest among them would be a “historic nightmare” for the U.S. He declined to elaborate,

“If the U.S. troops do not leave our region voluntarily and upright, we will do something to carry their bodies horizontally out,” Shamkhani said.

The U.S. Maritime Administration warned ships across the Mideast, citing the rising threats. “The Iranian response to this action, if any, is unknown, but there remains the possibility of Iranian action against U.S. maritime interests in the region,” it said.

Oil tankers were targeted in mine attacks last year that the U.S. blamed on Iran. Tehran denied responsibility, although it did seize oil tankers around the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of the world’s crude oil travels.

The U.S. Navy’s Bahrain-based 5th Fleet said it would work with shippers in the region to minimize any possible threat.

The 5th Fleet “has and will continue to provide advice to merchant shipping as appropriate regarding recommended security precautions in light of the heightened tensions and threats in the region,” 5th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Joshua Frey told The Associated Press.

Meanwhile, Iranian Gen. Alireza Tabgsiri, the chief of the Guard’s navy, issued his own warning.

“Our message to the enemies is to leave the region,” Tabgsiri said, according to ISNA. The Guard routinely has tense encounters with the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf.

Iran’s parliament, meanwhile, has passed an urgent bill declaring the U.S. military’s command at the Pentagon and those acting on its behalf in Soleimani’s killing as “terrorists,” subject to Iranian sanctions. The measure appears to be an attempt to mirror a decision by Trump in April to declare the Revolutionary Guard a “terrorist organization.”

The U.S. Defense Department used the Guard’s designation as a terror organization in the U.S. to support the strike that killed Soleimani. The decision by Iran’s parliament, done by a special procedure to speed the bill to law, comes as officials across the country threaten to retaliate for Soleimani’s killing.

The vote also saw lawmakers approve funding for the Quds Force with an additional 200 million euros, or about $224 million.

Also Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the U.S. had declined to issue him a visa to travel to New York for upcoming meetings at the United Nations. As the host of the U.N. headquarters, the U.S. is supposed to allow foreign officials to attend such meetings.

“This is because they fear someone will go there and tell the truth to the American people,” Zarif said. “But they are mistaken. The world is not limited to New York. You can speak with American people from Tehran too and we will do that.”

The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Solemani will ultimately be laid to rest between the graves of Enayatollah Talebizadeh and Mohammad Hossein Yousef Elahi, two former Guard comrades. The two died in Operation Dawn 8 in Iran’s 1980s war with Iraq in which Soleimani also took part, a 1986 amphibious assault that cut Iraq off from the Persian Gulf and led to the end of the bloody war that killed 1 million people.

250,08-1-20,"2 days on, cops still gathering clues to arrest masked goons","It is over two days since the masked assailants ran riot on the JNU campus, but no arrests have been made so far as the police are still looking for vital clues.

The Delhi Police on Tuesday issued a public appeal seeking pictures, footage or any information related to about Sunday’s violence on JNU campus that left 34 people injured even as forensic teams looked for evidence. Teams from Physics, Chemistry and Biology divisions of the Forensic Science Laboratory were in the university, sources said. The Physics team will collect evidence such as rods and stones used by the masked mob to attack students and teachers at the university, while the Chemistry team will collect samples of chemicals, if there are any. The biology team will collect DNA samples, among other evidence.

Senior police officials said police teams are trying to identify the accused persons who were involved in the violence and once they are identified, legal action against them will follow.

Delhi Police’s Crime Branch issued a public appeal urging “all those who are witnesses to the incident or have any information about the incident or have captured any activity on their mobile phones or camera” to “come forward and give their statements/ footage/picture in their possession to the SIT”.

The Delhi Police has registered two FIRs in connection with vandalism at the server room of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). According to a senior police official, the FIRs were registered on the complaint of JNU administration on January 5. The JNU administration had given the names of students union office bearers, including its president Aishe Gosh, in connection with the vandalism in the server room but police have not put her name or that of other students in the accused column of the FIRs.

One complaint was lodged on January 3 for switching off the server while another complaint was registered on January 4 for vandalising the server room, police said.

JNUSU vice-president Saket Moon alleged the administration is selectively targeting some students and denied any involvement in the vandalism of the server room.

The SIT is headed by Joy Tirkey, DCP Crime while Joint Commissioner of Police (Western Range) Shalini Singh is heading a fact-finding committee to probe the incident. She visited the JNU campus and spoke to students and teachers on Tuesday. The Joint CP visited all spots and interacted with the students.

Meanwhile, Delhi Police’s Crime Branch issued a public appeal urging “all those who are witnesses to the incident or have any information about the incident or have captured any activity on their mobile phones or camera” to “come forward and give their statements/footage/picture in their possession to the SIT”.

On Sunday, a mob of masked young people stormed the JNU campus in south Delhi and targeted students in three hostels, unleashing mayhem with sticks, stones and iron rods, hitting inmates and breaking windows, furniture and personal belongings. They also attacked a women’s hostel. Security has been strengthened in the campus following the violence. Police personnel in large numbers are present near various gates of the university to ensure that no untoward incident takes place.

Police has barricaded the gates and only visitors with valid identity cards are being allowed entry. The Crime Branch, along with the local police team, had visited the campus on Monday to collect evidence, including CCTV footage. The agency is scanning all CCTV footage of the incident and also the video clips uploaded on social media and circulated on WhatsApp, according to police.

“The SIT is probing the case in a scientific and professional manner and evidence is being collected,” said Anil Mittal, Additional PRO of Delhi Police adding no arrest has been made so far as the investigation to identify the culprits is underway.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/2-days-on--cops-still-gathering-clues-to-arrest-masked-goons-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/2-days-on--cops-still-gathering-clues-to-arrest-masked-goons.html

The actress said that getting into production helped her deal with fame.

She said: ""I was searching for different ways of taking control of my life, to get where I wanted to be. As a producer, you get to be a part of everything.

""For me, how I portray women in cinema matters a lot and next year will see me portray some really distinctive, independent, confident and individualistic women. I think I will showcase the different shades of being a woman next year (2020),"" Bhumi said.

The 30-year-old actress will be seen as a leading lady in the Akshay Kumar presentation ""Durgavati"" and ""Dolly Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitaare"". She will also have cameos in the Ayushmann Khurrana starrer ""Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhaan"" and Vicky Kaushal's ""Bhoot : The Haunted Ship"".

257,08-1-20,"Deepika earns praise from all quarters for 'quiet grace' on JNU stand, also faces boycott","Leapfrogging from the entertainment section to the front pages of newspapers for showing up at JNU, Bollywood star Deepika Padukone was on Wednesday the cynosure of national attention earning bouquets but also many brickbats on social media and elsewhere.

On Tuesday evening, Deepika made a surprise visit to the Jawaharlal Nehru University to express solidarity with the students who had been attacked.

Her decision to stand in silence with JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, who received head injuries during the attack on Sunday evening, at a public meeting in the campus prompted many in the industry and outside to praise her for her ""quiet grace"" and ""courage"". It also prompted hashtags to boycott her Friday release ""Chhapaak"", a film based on acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal.

Though several people in Bollywood have voiced their protest against the attack on students and faculty by a masked mob, Deepika is the rare Bollywood A-lister to do so.

Deepika, who faced death threats and social media vitriol for speaking out during the release of her controversial film ""Padmaavat"", turns producer with ""Chhapaak"", directed by Meghna Gulzar, making her stake even higher.

""When she was attacked over 'Padmaavat' very few came forward to support her. She knows what it feels to be targetted and she has shown exemplary courage by supporting the JNU students with quiet grace. More power to Deepika Padukone,"" veteran actor Shabana Azmi tweeted on Wednesday.

Swara Bhasker, who was one of the firsts from the film community to call for action against the perpetrators of Sunday violence, said ""Bollywood just got JNU-ised! #LongLiveJNU #JNUProtests.""

Director Anurag Kashyap said he has ""mad respect"" for the actor and urged people to watch her upcoming film ""first day all shows"".

""The female of the species is, and was, and will always be the strongest of the two #DeepikaPadukone... Let's all those who stand against the violence go to @bookmyshow and show them. Make our silent statement which will be the loudest,"" Kashyap, a vocal supporter of the protests against the citizenship amendment bill and the JNU attack, wrote on the microblogging site.

A day after Kashyap uploaded a cartoon of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah in masks with lathis as his Twitter display picture, the director replaced it with a photo of Deepika standing in front of the JNUSU president in what appeared to be a folded hands gesture.

""Let's not forget she is also the producer of the film.. Stakes are even higher,"" he added.

Director Vikramaditya Motwane called Deepika a ""true hero"".

""Deepika's stand is going to make a lot of young people question their parents, their peers and their government. Hopefully, they will go out and educate themselves and not parrot everything authority tells them,"" he said.

Veteran director-producer Mahesh Bhatt said, ""We are a 'kingdom' of silence no longer!""

Actor Sayani Gupta, who was one of the first stars from Bollywood to ask the actors who took a selfie with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year to speak up, thanked Deepika for lending a ""mainstream narrative"" to the movement.

""For using your position to choose the correct path. It always comes to the women and yes, they do deliver! Big love sister! #WeAreWithJNU #noplaceforfascism,"" Sayani said in a tweet.

Juhi Chaturvedi, the writer of the 2015 Deepika-starrer ""Piku"", said the actor's courage was ""inspiring"".

""You truly are incredible!"" Juhi added.

Her ""Chhapaak"" co-star Vikrant Massey also tweeted the viral pictures from JNU campus and said his heart ""swells with pride"".

Dressed in a black high neck sweater -- changing from the red she was wearing during the film's promotion earlier on Tuesday evening -- the 34-year-old actor chose not to speak, standing by as former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar raised slogans of 'azaadi' and left by the time Aishe started speaking.

""Speak for every injustice! Deepika 'Proud of you, take care' #JNUVCMustResign"", Aishe said on Facebook after the event and shared her photograph with the actor.

Kanhaiya cautioned the actor about probable trolling for her stand with JNU.

""More power to you @deepikapadukone and thank you for your solidarity and support. You might be abused or trolled today, but history will remember you for your courage and standing by the idea of India,"" he tweeted.

Quoting Bob Dylan's prophetic ""The Times They Are a-Changin'"", former JNU student Umar Khalid thanked Deepika for standing up for students and youth against ""fascist bullies"".

Tagging Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan, the former JNU student leader said, ""Uncles, agar zameer zinda hai, to ab to kuch boldo (Uncles, if your conscience is alive, now is the time to speak up.)""

Alongside the fulsome praise came the vitriol.

Many social media users called for the boycott of the social drama, asking people to watch Ajay Devgn's ""Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior"" that faces off with ""Chhapaak"" on Friday.

""#boycottchhapaak Thank you but no thank you @deepikapadukone - cancelled ticket of 'Chhapaak',"" wrote a tweeple.

""Watch #TanhajiTheUnsungWarriror #boycottChhapaak,"" said another, sharing ""Tanhaji"" poster.

""#boycottchhapaak she lost all respect.""

Calling her visit a promotional stunt, a social media user said, ""Shame Shame @deepikapadukone. What a move to promote your movie by standing with #TukdeTukdeGang. But we are not fools. We'll make you understand that what mistake have to done. #boycottchhapaak.""

Another urged people to unfollow the actor for supporting the 'deshdrohi' (anti nationals).

""Chhapaak"" co-writer Atika Chohan dismissed that actor-producer's JNU trek had anything to do with ""publicity"".

""Imagine taking a stand two days before your film release when it's your money and hard work on the line. This is not publicity. This is an ardent call of the conscience. I support Deepika Padukone for life, not just for Chhapaak. #ISupportDeepika,"" Atika tweeted.

Writer-lyricist Varun Grover also posted Deepika's picture from JNU and wrote, ""Empathy can save this world. #ISupportDeepika.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/deepika-earns-praise-from-all-quarters-for--quiet-grace--on-jnu-stand--also-faces-boycott-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/deepika-earns-praise-from-all-quarters-for--quiet-grace--on-jnu-stand--also-faces-boycott.html

259,08-1-20,US sends more firefighters to help battle Australia blazes,"US officials said Tuesday they're planning to send at least another 100 firefighters to Australia to join 159 already in the country battling wildfires that have killed 25 people and destroyed 2,000 homes.

The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, said that 90 firefighters including on-the-ground hand crews left in recent days to fight fires that have scorched an area twice the size of the U.S. State of Maryland.

Another 100 American firefighters are expected to fly to Australia next week, said center spokeswoman Carrie Bilbao. It's the largest ever deployment of U.S. Firefighters abroad, she said.

The Australian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council requested the firefighters as part of a reciprocal deal that sent 138 Australians to fight U.S. Wildfires in 2018.

The US has similar agreements with Canada, Mexico and New Zealand.

Officials are working to send the additional firefighters to Australia quickly so they can assume wildfire management and aviation management roles.

The most recent contingent of firefighters dispatched to Australia included crews that fight fires on the ground, based in the US Forest Service's Angeles National Forest in California.

Bilbao said the next group will also include more ground crews and that they are receiving training about poisonous snakes and insects they might encounter while fighting wildfires in Australia.

“They're there to work with Australia in any capacity needed,” Bilbao said.

The National Interagency Fire Center directs the U.S.'s wildland firefighting forces, which include thousands of firefighters who work for the Forest Service and the US Department of the Interior and hundreds of aircraft. Their ranks can be stretched thin during the summer wildfire season, but officials can free them up during the winter to fight fires elsewhere.

It is summer in Australia, where the wildfires have been raging since September, fueled by drought and the country's hottest and driest year on record. Australia's fires started months earlier than normal.

“We are proud to provide personnel from the United States and will continue to support Australia with the resources needed during this unprecedented fire situation,” said US Forest Service Fire Director Shawna Legarza.

The US, Australia and New Zealand have been exchanging firefighters for more than 15 years. The last time the U.S. Sent firefighters to Australia was in 2010.

""As the extreme fire danger continues across Australia, the Department of the Interior will continue to do all that we can to support requests for assistance,"" said Craig Leff, the Interior Department's Wildland Fire deputy director.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-sends-more-firefighters-to-help-battle-australia-blazes-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-sends-more-firefighters-to-help-battle-australia-blazes.html

""If they are wise, they won't take any other action at this juncture."" The remarks came hours after Iran fired a wave of missiles at Iraqi bases housing US troops in retaliation for the assassination of Qasem Soleimani.

But Rouhani said it would not be enough if Iran's armed forces hit back for any other action taken by the United States. ""In my view, America must receive the main response from the nations of the region,"" he said.

The president was repeating a common refrain among Iranian officials since the assassination that Soleimani's death will see US forces leave the region.

""They cut off the hand of our dear Soleimani. The revenge for him is to cut off America's feet from this region,"" Rouhani said.

""If America's feet is cut off from this region, and its hand of aggression is cut off for good, this is the real and final response of the nations of the region to America,"" he added.

Several users on Twitter expressed their disappointment over the rumoured change in ‘name' of the attacker.

""If Bollywood makes a movie based on true events of 9/11, they'll portray Osama Bin Laden as Om Prakash Tiwari,"" one user posted.

Another user said: ""Understand the chronology. Chhapak film is based on Laxmi Agarwal an acid attack survivor. Nadeem Khan is the name of the person who throws acid in real life. In film name is changed to Rajesh ... a Hindu name. So Deepika's visit to JNU is not surprising.""

264,08-1-20,"iPhone users' data supreme, no back door access: Apple","Reiterating its commitment to safeguard the iPhone user's data at any cost, Apple has defended its stance on hardware encryption at the 'CES 2020' trade show here, as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) asked the Cupertino-based giant to unlock two iPhones.

Participating in a privacy-focused session, Jane Horvath, Apple's Senior Director of Global Privacy, lauded Apple's initiatives to protect consumers' data.

""Building back doors into encryption is not the way we are going to solve those issues,"" she said.

On Monday, the FBI sent a letter to Apple asking for help in the extraction of data from two iPhones, believed to have been used by a suspect in killing three people in a shooting in Florida in December last year.

According to a CNBC report on Wednesday, Horvath took the company line, defending Apple's implementation of strong hardware encryption.

Apple also denied FBI access to an iPhone belonging to the shooter in San Bernardino terror attack in 2016. The FBI had to pay professional hackers to break into the device.

""Our phones are relatively small and they get lost and stolen. If we're going to be able to rely on our health data and finance data on our devices, we need to make sure that if you misplace that device, you're not losing your sensitive data"", Horvath was quoted as saying.

The Cupertino-based tech giant made a rare official appearance after 28 years at the CES.

Apple formally participated in the CES in 1992 in Chicago when its then CEO John Sculley appeared at a summit to release the Newton device.

At last year's CES show in Las Vegas, Apple placed a huge billboard that read: ""What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone.""",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iphone-users--data-supreme--no-back-door-access--apple-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/iphone-users--data-supreme--no-back-door-access--apple.html
265,08-1-20,US firm to provide high-res weather forecasting in India,"Boston-based weather technology company ClimaCell on Wednesday announced a collaboration with Google Cloud to improve weather forecasting in India by providing high-resolution forecast models free of charge for up to 48 hours ahead.

ClimaCell Bespoke Atmospheric Model (CBAM) will be available as 'ClimaCell-CBAM India Weather Forecasts' to the general public, including developers, scientists and business users, the company said in a statement.

Google Cloud will contribute cloud resources to support the massive computational effort associated with running such a high performance model.

""For the first time, a private company is offering a full-blown operational numerical weather prediction model for an entire country, working continuously and providing high-resolution forecasts for up to 48 hours ahead,"" said Shimon Elkabetz, CEO and Co-Founder of ClimaCell.

The developing world had been till now been relying on weather forecast generated by global models with course resolution and lower refresh time.

However, with CBAM, ClimaCell and Google Cloud will bring high resolution and refresh time to levels exceeding mesoscale models in developed countries, beginning in India.

CBAM India will be provided at 2 km resolution and 15-minute timestep, and will provide a 48-hour forecast.

This model will serve as the foundation for a new generation of environmental prediction models, such as floods, air quality and more.

266,08-1-20,New Google Project gives more time to address security bugs,"In a bid to give developers more time to address security vulnerabilities, Google has made changes to its Project Zero disclosure programme which could also mean that other companies roll out half-baked patches.

Announced in July, 2014, the Project Zero is a team of security analysts employed by Google who are tasked with finding zero-day vulnerabilities, the secret hackable bugs which are exploited by criminals, state-sponsored hackers, and intelligence agencies.

""We recently reviewed our policies and the goals we hope to accomplish with our disclosure policy. As a result of that review, we have decided to make some changes to our vulnerability disclosure policy in 2020. We will start by describing the changes to the policy, and then discuss the rationale behind these changes,"" Tim Willis, Manager, Project Zero, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.

""For vulnerabilities reported starting January 1, 2020, we are changing our Disclosure Policy: Full 90 days by default, regardless of when the bug is fixed.""

If there is mutual agreement between the vendor and Project Zero, bug reports can be opened to the public before 90 days elapse.

For example, a vendor wants to synchronise the opening of our tracker report with their release notes to minimise user confusion and questions.

""Fix a bug in 20 days? We will release all details on Day 90. Fix a bug in 90 days? We will release all details on Day 90,"" noted Willis.

The tech giant said it will try this policy for 12 months, and then consider whether to change it long term.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/new-google-project-gives-more-time-to-address-security-bugs-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/new-google-project-gives-more-time-to-address-security-bugs.html
267,08-1-20,Amazon sold hundreds of millions of Alexa devices,"There are now hundreds of millions of Alexa-enabled devices out there - a huge increase from 100 million Alexa-powered devices the company announced last year in January.

It include Amazon's own lines of Echo speakers, Fire tablets and Fire TV streamers, as well as third-party devices like wearables, TVs and computers.

""Much of this growth has been fueled by the continued invention of developers and device makers, all of whom make Alexa even better for customers,"" Amazon said in a statement at CES 2020.

There are now more than 100,000 Alexa-compatible smart home products from more than 9,500 unique brands, more than 100,000 skills from Alexa developers, and hundreds of products with Alexa built-in

""Meanwhile, content providers like Apple TV+, Disney+, Peloton, and YouTube TV have helped produce an even richer, more diverse experience on Fire TV, which now has more than 40 million monthly active users,"" the company added.

Alexa is now available in vehicles from automakers like Audi, BMW, Ford, and Toyota.

Amazon announced integrations with several new automotive brands at the CES 2020.

268,08-1-20,Have become better T20 bowler in last two years with improved skills: Thakur,"Having worked considerably on his skill-sets, speedster Shardul Thakur feels that he has become a ""better T20 bowler"" compared to what he was a couple of years back.

Thakur featured in his first T20 International in 22 months. The figures of 3/23 showed that there has been a marked improvement in his death bowling since the 2018 Nidahas T20 Trophy in Sri Lanka where he was a batsman's delight.

""I feel T20 is such a short format, there are always going to be ups and downs. The more you play, the more experienced you get and you keep learning. Whereas first-class and Test cricket are formats where you have time to think about your game but in T20 you don't have that time,"" Thakur said following India's seven-wicket win against Sri Lanka.

Playing IPL regularly over the past couple of seasons has been one of the reasons for his success, feels Thakur.

""So whenever you practice, you need to add to your strengths and keep bettering your skills. Over a period of time, while practising I have been developing my skills and brushing it up. Playing last two-three years in the IPL, and domestic cricket, I have gotten better,"" Thakur said.

Like all the young pacers, Thakur also spoke about the contribution from Indian team's bowling coach Bharat Arun as it's difficult to manage sessions with a personal coach in a heavy duty cricket calendar.

""At this point, it is very difficult to work with a particular coach because I am in and out of the Indian team. Sometimes I play for Mumbai, then Chennai Super Kings. Now I am again with the Indian team. But recently, our bowling coach (India) Bharat Arun has been really helpful,"" said Thakur.

He picked all his wickets against Sri Lanka in the penultimate (19th) over and his plan was to keep things simple.

""I just had to bowl as many dot balls (that) I could. Luckily, I got three wickets there. It is satisfying. I have been working hard for it. When it pays off in an international game, it makes me really happy,"" said the Mumbai pacer.

Sri Lanka could only manage 142 for nine, which India chased down comfortably. Thakur said it was a below-par total considering the conditions.

""The pitch was very good. It was about 170-180 wicket. I don't think it was difficult to score runs on that pitch. There was no dew also today.""

He also praised fellow fast bowler Navdeep Saini, who too impressed on Tuesday

""He was really good in this game. The way he uses his bouncers and yorkers is creditable. He was also bowling with some gas,"" added Thakur.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/have-become-better-t20-bowler-in-last-two-years-with-improved-skills--thakur-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/have-become-better-t20-bowler-in-last-two-years-with-improved-skills--thakur.html
269,08-1-20,"Know how to build my innings now, says Rahul","India opener KL Rahul feels he has got ""a lot better"" at reading the game and building his innings, the secret to his consistent performance in the white ball formats.

Rahul is enjoying a good run in limited overs cricket having hit two hundreds and three half centuries in the ODIs and to top it up, three more fifty plus scores in T20s in 2019.

""I've just been getting runs and the reading of the game has gotten a lot better and knowing how to build my innings again,"" Rahul said after India's victory over Sri Lanka in the second T20 here.

""I felt that was lacking and I always knew I had the game to get the runs and it was just a matter of spending time in the middle. Really happy to carry on the same way,"" Rahul added.

Chasing 143, India defeated Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the second T20 on Tuesday, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.

Rahul, who scored 45 off 32 balls, credited the bowlers for restricting the visitors to a below par score.

""It was a smaller target and my plans were simple which is to spend some time in the middle. Our bowlers bowled really well and anything around 170 on this wicket would have been par. A lot of credit must go to the bowlers.""

In the absence of Rohit Sharma, Rahul partnered with Shikhar Dhawan to put up a 71-run opening stand and 27-year-old said that he enjoys batting with both his senior opening partners.

""We all go out there with a simple plan which is to win the game for your country. He (Rohit) makes it look so easy and I've always batted with Shikhar especially at the start of my Test career and we understand each other well and I just enjoy batting with both of them,"" Rahul said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/know-how-to-build-my-innings-now--says-rahul-2020-01-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/know-how-to-build-my-innings-now--says-rahul.html
