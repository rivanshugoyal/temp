0,29-2-20,Emerging fault lines,"The ILP requires all the finesse, ingenuity and statecraft of the Government to constitutionally balance competing demands of various segments of the population among the eight sisters

As the situation in northeast India continues to be one of anxiety, the more or less forgotten Inner Line Permit (ILP) regime appears to be poised to assume centrestage in the coming months. For the first time when I reached Itanagar early in 1997, on a posting as the Chief of Police of Arunachal Pradesh, I must confess, I had not even heard of the Inner Line and its importance for the State.

Familiarising myself with the affairs of the State, I had been advised to read Verrier Elwin’s book and some others, too. Though Elwin was not around when the Inner Line regime was conceived, he is considered to be an authority on the subject. He has explained the concept very succinctly. According to him, the significance of the ILP can be understood as: “It was a two-fold attempt to protect both the tribal people and the settlers in the plains. On the one hand, it prevented encroachments on tribal land. On the other, by checking irritations that might incite the tribesmen to rebellion and raids, it protected the tea planters and their labour.” A pressing need for such a regulation was particularly felt after a violent incident with some tea planters of British origin.

Way back in 1873, when the present State of Assam and, in fact, the entire North-eastern region, was a part of Bengal, the then Lt Governor had issued regulations known as the “Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation.” These were applicable to the erstwhile territories of the districts of Kamrup, Darrang, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur, Garo Khasi and Jaintia Hills, Naga Hills and Cachar. Later, these were also extended to Sadiya, Lakhimpur and Balipara frontier tracts and other such tracts covering the entire territory of NEFA (now Arunachal), Nagaland and Lushai Hills (now Mizoram).

Manipur being a princely State, it never came under its purview. Subsequently, the territories of Assam and Meghalaya (Garo Khasi and Jaintia Hills) were taken out of the purview of these regulations. At the time of their original promulgation, according to Section 2, all citizens of India or any person residing here was prohibited from crossing the Inner Line unless permitted. Similarly, as per Section 7, outsiders were barred from acquiring any interest in land or the products of land beyond the Inner Line. Though not applied in most cases, there is a provision for stringent penalties for violation of these regulations.

For all these years, a continuation of the Inner Line regime has been justified on grounds of preservation of tribal culture and language. Now, in the wake of protests related to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), this regulation that dates back to 1873, has once again occupied the centre stage. The long-standing demand of the State of Manipur has since been accepted and the provisions of the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873, were notified to be extended to the entire State with effect from December 2019, while exempting it from the provisions of the CAA. The Meiteis constitute about 55 per cent of the Manipuris while the tribals account for 35 per cent.

The tribal communities are themselves divided into several factions and have been at loggerheads with each other for a long time. However, they are together as far as opposition to the Meiteis is concerned. Their fear is that the Meiteis might try to get the benefits of the Scheduled Tribes after the ILP is extended to the entire State and not to the tribal areas alone. Extension of ILP to the entire State of Manipur can be validated only if it is treated as a tribal area. Otherwise, it would get invalidated being violative of Article 19 (1) (d)(e) of the Constitution.

There are other reasons, too, for such suspicions to have gained strength. The earlier Government in Manipur had passed a few legislations like the Manipur People’s (Protection) Bill and the Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Amendment Bill without taking the tribal communities into confidence. These Bills were reserved by the Governor for the consideration of the President, who did not give his assent. The current scene is one of wait and watch.

The attitude of the tribal communities of Manipur towards the extension of ILP to the State would also depend on the provisions of the Central Government’s accord with the Nagas. In case the calculated risk taken by the Government for the introduction of ILP in Manipur succeeds, then such demands from Tripura and Meghalaya may also have to be accepted.

Simultaneously, the demand for the enforcement of ILP in the entire State of Assam has gathered momentum. Clause 6 of the Assam Accord pertains to the constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people. The responsibility for its implementation being with the Government of India, a committee had been constituted by the Ministry of Home Affairs to suggest measures to be taken for the implementation of Clause 6.

This committee, chaired by BK Sharma, a former judge of the Guwahati High Court, has reportedly submitted its report to the State Government, though technically, it should have come to the Ministry. There appears to be a distinct possibility of an emerging discord between the Ministry of Home Affairs and the committee as the latter had recommended the implementation of the ILP for the entire State of Assam and the former has some reservations.

Constitutionally, it would be difficult to justify such a measure as tribal areas of Assam and Meghalaya, besides Mizoram, are all covered under Schedule VI of the Constitution with full-fledged autonomous district councils already functioning there. The autonomous Bodoland Territorial Council was recently inaugurated by the Prime Minister.

The North-eastern region has always given a lot many anxious moments to the nation. This cauldron is at present almost on the boil and would require all the tact, finesse, ingenuity and statecraft to constitutionally balance the competing demands of various segments of the population among the eight sisters.

1,29-2-20,Verbal duel in UP Assembly over remark on minister,"A verbal duel between members of opposition and treasury benches was witnessed in the UP Assembly after leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary made a controversial remark on Labour and Employment Minister Swami Prasad Maurya on Friday.

The incident took place during Question Hour in the House when the Minister was replying to a question on allowance to unemployed youth in the state, put forth by Samajwadi Party members.

Maurya refused to entertain their demand and claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party government was doing everything to provide jobs to the youths. He even announced that youths, registered with employment exchanges, would be given priority in those jobs which were outsourced in government department.

The controversy started when the labour minister disclosed that during the present regime, 2.81 lakh youths registered with the employment exchange were given jobs as compared to merely 1.80 lakh during the previous Samajwadi Party regime.

Annoyed with Maurya’s reply, Chaudhary made a personal attack saying, ‘’A thief always sees others as thieves.’’ He did not stop there and went to the extent of saying that a political turncoat was the most corrupt person.”

Formerly with the Bahujan Samaj Party, Maurya was leader of opposition during the previous SP regime but he joined the BJP before 2017 Assembly polls.

Chaudhary’s statement irked the treasury bench and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna alleged that the previous SP regime gave orders to release terrorists and raked up corruption in UP Public Service Commission (UPPSC). He also demanded that the derogatory remark of the leader of opposition be removed from the records.

After the exchange, the House witnessed noisy scenes with both sides trading charges and seeking apology from each other

Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit had to intervene to defuse the situation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/verbal-duel-in-up-assembly-over-remark-on-minister.html
2,29-2-20,Mayawati seeks judicial probe into Delhi clashes,"After advising Bharatiya Janata Party and Aam Aadmi Party not to play “dirty” politics over Delhi riots and instead make joint efforts to restore peace at the earliest, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Friday wrote a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind demanding a high-level judicial probe into the Delhi violence.

Mayawati said that there was a considerable amount of loss of life and property in the violence witnessed in some parts of New Delhi. Stressing that the violence had “trampled” Delhi like during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Mayawati termed them as most serious and unfortunate and said they had drawn the concern of the world and got negative publicity.

“A high-level inquiry monitored by a Supreme Court judge needs to be ordered into the violent clashes in Delhi so that a conclusion can be reached and stains on the national capital, like that of the anti-Sikh riots, could be washed off to some extent,” Mayawati said in the letter released by the party here on Friday afternoon.

“The ruling party and the government have a special duty to see that neither they do anything that would damage the prestige of the country nor do their partymen give any statement or indulge in act that would lead to anarchy and violence and become international headlines,” she said.

The BSP supremo said that those who had lost family members and property in the violence should be given appropriate compensation by the Centre and the Delhi government. She further said that stringent action should be taken against those behind the violence.

It may be mentioned that violent clashes in northeast Delhi areas have left 39 dead and more than 250 injured.

The BSP president charged that the “country has seen and felt that BJP and its government have failed to fulfil its legal and constitutional duty as a result of which about three dozen lives have been lost and 200 have been injured and several businesses destroyed in times of high inflation, poverty and unemployment.”

Mayawati said “negligence” and “failure” of the Delhi Police and administration in the riots was for everyone to see.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mayawati-seeks-judicial-probe-into-delhi-clashes.html
3,29-2-20,Temple construction panel chief to visit Ayodhya today,"Ram Temple Construction Committee chairperson Nripendra Mishra will visit Ayodhya on Saturday to decide on shifting the idol of Ram Lalla to an alternative place till the completion of the grand temple.

Mishra, a former IAS officer from Uttar Pradesh cadre, met Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow on Friday evening. Sources said that they were closeted for around half an hour during which both discussed the construction of Ram temple.

Officials said that the Ram Temple Construction Committee chairman would first offer prayers at Ram Lalla temple and inspect the area for the construction of a grand temple.

Mishra is also expected to meet Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust members and discuss an alternative place to shift the idol till the temple is completed.

Meanwhile, government officials are monitoring the cleanliness drive launched at Ram Janmabhoomi area.

On the other hand, Ayodhya district authorities have extended prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code in the district due to different reasons till April 25.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/temple-construction-panel-chief-to-visit-ayodhya-today.html
4,29-2-20,Lower power tariff once financial losses end: Min,"Claiming that there was no shortage of power in the state, the Uttar Pradesh government announced in the Assembly on Friday that the Energy department could consider cheap power tariff once the financial losses ended.

However, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party members staged a noisy walkout from the Assembly, demanding immediate reduction of power tariff.

Replying to a series of questions during Question Hour on Friday, Energy Minister Shrikant Sharma admitted that though several reforms had been initiated in the Energy department which had started yielding results, yet the cash financial gap was around Rs 13,000 crore.

“We can only expect cheap power when the power sector’s loss is wiped out,” he informed the House.

However the energy minister was critical of the previous Samajwadi Party government which signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) at a higher price that led to huge loss to the power sector and resulted in the rise in power tariff.

“The previous government had done PAA at a higher rate between Rs 5.14 and Rs 11.09 per unit, while the present government has reduced the PPA to Rs 2 to Rs 4.19 per unit,” Sharma said.

Leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary said that when the government was purchasing power at such a low price then why was it charging the consumer such high tariff and demanded immediate reduction of power charges from consumers.

His demand was supported by BSP leader Lalji Verma and Congress members.

But the energy minister said that the demand for reduction of power tariff could not be accepted. “The cost to provide power to villages is Rs 7.50 per unit but the government is charging just Rs 1.75 per unit from rural consumers,” the minister said.

Sharma further said that during the last three years of the present Bharatiya Janata Party regime, power consumers had increased by 52 per cent indicating that power supply had increased and reforms in power sector were yielding positive results. He also said that UP was generating around 8,700 megawatt of power including over 1,000 generated through solar plants.

Presently, the Energy department is supplying 15,800 MW of power as per demand, of which 7,100 MW was being purchased from outside the state.

Not satisfied with the minister’s reply, the SP and BSP members staged a noisy walkout from the House.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lower-power-tariff-once-financial-losses-end--min.html
5,29-2-20,Yogi hikes Vidhayak Nidhi,"Acceding to the unanimous demand of members of UP Assembly, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced to hike Vidhayak Nidhi (MLA Local Area Development Fund) from the present Rs 2 crore to Rs 3 crore.

Along with Rs 2 crore, an additional Rs 40 lakh was also paid for GST but the Chief Minister did not clarify whether the GST amount would also be revised.

The Vidhayak Nidhi was last revised from Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore in June, 2018.

A rare unanimity was witnessed in the Assembly on Wednesday when MLAs cutting across party lines, demanded an increase in their salaries and Vidhayak Nidhi. The MLAs demanded that their salary and allowances be linked to inflation index as was the case with state employees.

On the demand for the hike in salary and allowances, Yogi suggested that a Joint House Committee headed by Finance Minister Suresh Khanna be set up to look into the matter after inviting suggestion from all parties and their leaders.

The CM also asked Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit to set up a committee to suggest ways and means for peaceful, smooth and constructive debate and discussion in the House.

“This House needs healthy and constructive discussions for speedy development of the state,” he said.

Yogi also appealed to legislators to inform the government about development of their constituency so that it could be published in a magazine on the occasion of the third anniversary of the government on March 15.

The CM also announced that like previous year, the government could hold special session on different occasions this year too.

In 2019, three special sessions were held, including one on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

“Opposition members boycotted the special session on sustainable development goal, which they are now repenting,” he said.

Yogi thanked the members and Assembly employees and officials for their cooperation during the session.

Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit also thanked the members and others but leader of the opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary did not speak on the occasion nor did other opposition members.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yogi-hikes-vidhayak-nidhi.html
6,29-2-20,Two minors raped,"



|

The state was rocked by two sensational crimes against children as a seven-year-old girl was raped and murdered in Kaushambi while a three-year-old girl was battling for her life after being raped in Mainpuri.

In Kaushambi, the victim from Kokhraj police station area was murdered after being raped. Her body was recovered and an autopsy was conducted.

As per reports, a snake charmer of a village in Shivli in Kanpur Dehat district was living with his family in Kokhraj area for the last fortnight by setting up a tarpaulin hut.

The snake charmer’s seven-year-old daughter went out around 5:30 pm on Thursday and never returned after which the family launched a search for her.

Around 10 pm, the victim’s family informed Kokhraj police about the disappearance of the minor girl.

During the search, the body of the girl covered in blood was found in a pigeon farm about 600 metres from the railway station.

The police took the body into custody and sent it for autopsy.

The victim’s father accused the child’s uncle of rape and murder. The cops raided the house of the accused but he absconded.

Meanwhile in Mainpuri, Sudha (name changed), of Bhogaon locality accompanied her parents to a marriage function on Wednesday night. She was playing at the venue from where she suddenly disappeared.

One of the woman guests went to the toilet and was shocked to see the girl lying in a pool of blood and a youth running out of the toilet. She raised an alarm after which other guests rushed and shifted the girl to a hospital.

Superintendent of Police of Mainpuri, Ajay Kumar, said that soon after being informed about the crime, the child was rushed to a hospital. He said that the doctors said that the girl was raped and her condition was serious but stable.

A case of rape under Section 376 of the IPC and POCSO Act was registered and a dozen persons were detained for questioning.

He said that the guest house in which the incident took place had eight close circuit television (CCTVs) cameras but due to some technical snag, recording of the event could not be made.

Four teams have been formed and a computer sketch of the accused was drawn with the help of the eyewitness. The police were also taking the help of video recording of the function made by a photographer to identify the culprit.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/two-minors-raped.html

8,29-2-20,Markets get the flu,"Covid-2019 has spread across the world. Conferences are getting cancelled and global markets are in freefall

There was bloodbath on Indian markets throughout this week. It wasn’t because they were spooked by the communal riots in a lower-income part of the national Capital. No, the markets plunged on account of the impact of the Covid-2019, which has claimed 2,800 lives and infected 83,000, globally. Thousands of flights and major conferences across the world are being cancelled. Facebook’s flagship F8 developer conference, scheduled for May in San Jose, California, became the latest casualty. The Swiss Government’s decision to ban gatherings of over 1,000 people until March 15 has also led to the cancellation of the Geneva Motor Show, one of the biggest auto shows in the world. The global tourism industry is already in a freefall. The cruise industry has been particularly hit hard after Coronavirus ravaged the Diamond Princess. While the Indian stock exchanges followed plummeting global indices, it would be facile to dismiss this decline as a cascading global impact. Indian manufacturing has crucial dependencies built on East Asian manufacturing. A decline in supply may also affect consumption patterns, which may lead to joblessness, fuel inflation and, thus, impact the economy. Dependence on China for supplies spans across sectors and sub-sectors, and in many cases is as high as 60 per cent. As the virus spread to Japan and South Korea alongside China, many industrialists fear that production will come to a shuddering halt by April and supplies of critical components will dwindle. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman expressed as much concern, publicly declaring a wait and watch mode of three weeks. In addition, as the impact of the Coronavirus spreads to other nations in Europe and the Western hemisphere, there will be an impact on the Indian services industry as well.

With China’s share of fresh incidence of the disease plummeting, other nations are facing the brunt now. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded the number within it for the first time. While the global health organisation has not declared a pandemic-like situation at the moment, its potential in the near future cannot be ruled out. And it is here that globally nations must be well prepared. Challenges for Governments are immense: They have to not only ramp up healthcare facilities but also address the issue of commodity shortages. On a positive note, the Covid-2019 is also an opportunity for Governments to strengthen their local systems instead of remaining dependent on greater powers. In the Indian context, we must worry about human lives given our clotted density of population than just the economic fallout. Both the Central as well as State Governments must be prepared to evolve swift healthcare protocols. We must not forget that it was inaction, almost certainly deliberate, by the British colonial authorities in 1919 that led to the spread of the Spanish influenza outbreak, which killed an estimated 10 per cent of undivided India’s population. Access to healthcare outside major metropolitan areas is extremely limited and several critical drugs need the supplies of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from China. It seems incomprehensible that there have been only three confirmed cases in the country, all from Kerala. There is significant human traffic between India and China and with the huge outbreak in Northern Italy, where a significant Punjabi population works in the dairy industry, the Government should be at panic stations. There is no doubt that the recent riots in the northeast part of Delhi were unfortunate but if India catches the flu, the impact will be much, much worse. This is the time to be prepared with mock drills.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/markets-get-the-flu-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/markets-get-the-flu.html
9,29-2-20,More than goodwill,"India must get real and finally engage with the Taliban if it wants to be strategically relevant in Afghanistan

India has finally decided to get real on Afghanistan and agreed to attend the signing ceremony of a landmark peace deal between the US and the Afghan Taliban in Doha, following which American troops would withdraw from the region. For years, we have invested in developing infrastructure and humanitarian missions in that nation but refused to connect with the Taliban, predicating its significance to our Pakistan-centric vision, and abhorring it simply because Pakistan was its patron. While we insisted on an Afghan-led reconciliation, fearing that the Taliban would magnify Pakistan’s proxy war in our backyard, the Taliban regained its influence. And though our western neighbour may still continue to have a hold over it, we have to build a bridge to avoid strategic alienation. Or allow the Taliban to harden its outlook towards us. This is the reason why big powers like the US, Russia and Iran have been reaching out to the Taliban for geopolitical reasons. At least, India’s presence at the deal ceremony signals a willingness to engage, considering that we have lost much while being left out of the reconciliation process. We must also not stereotype the Taliban as an extension counter of Pakistan but recognise changes within it. It is now ready to engage with the world in consonance with diplomatic norms. One thing is clear, over the last three years, the Taliban has come to control almost half the territories and has changed its rules of engagement simply because it doesn’t want to be reviled or isolated, but wants acknowledgement and acceptance. Time and again, its spokespersons have expressed a desire to work with India, in a bid to shake off the dependency on Pakistan. More importantly, India’s allies in the region, both Russia and Iran, are cooperating with the Taliban and could play a mediatory role.

Pakistan’s interests in Afghanistan will continue to be India-centric, trying to erode the goodwill of India’s development work by peddling its own insecurities about our hegemonic potential. It will also try to bring in the Taliban to expand the scope of its proxy war over Kashmir. Besides, Pakistan’s military establishment would want to deepen its proximity with the Taliban to quell its own separatist sentiments at home, like that of a unified Pashtunistan. If India wants stability in the region, then it must neutralise Pakistan’s chokehold on the Taliban and work separate back channels with it. It cannot rely on past understanding and rigidities. Ignoring the Taliban means empowering Pakistan. Besides, India’s consistent support to the democratically-elected Afghan presidents since 2001 — Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani — have completely lost its counterweight value. If the recent results of the Afghan election are any indication, then Ghani has a really thin margin of victory. Undoubtedly then, the Taliban is almost on an equal footing and is already questioning Ghani’s credibility. It is even attempting to talk to “intra-Afghan” factions, according to a statement by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. We may have scored high on our soft power capabilities and have acceptability among Afghan people but if we have to matter, then we must not be a reluctant neighbour. We must reach out to all players in Afghanistan but independently and without referencing others.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/more-than-goodwill-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/more-than-goodwill.html
10,29-2-20,Look beyond the surface,"Though no major pacts were signed between the US and India, advancements were made in the important areas of defence, energy and partnership in the Indo-Pacific

Riding on the back of greater people-to-people connect, public opinion has had an increasingly critical role in shaping India-US relations, at least in the last two decades. Opinion ratings and endorsements of US President Donald Trump have reached an unprecedented high among the people in India, says a recent survey by Pew Research. This positive view of Trump surfaced most palpably during his recently-concluded visit to India. The spectacle in Motera stadium, the cultural symbolism of Mahatma Gandhi and the presidential welcome in New Delhi, all generated favourable public opinion for Indo-US relations.

On the face of it, Trump’s visit did not score very high as no major or new agreement was signed between the two countries — except for the $3 billion defence deal which is a small amount in the overall bilateral trade between the two countries. However, if we look beyond the surface, perhaps his visit served exactly the purpose it was intended to.

One of the most important developments signalling progress in bilateral relations was the elevation of ties to a Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership. Technically, it signifies a step forward in the already existing alliance between the two countries, albeit in a broader spectrum of cooperation and, perhaps, with globally-shared responsibilities.

In so far as concrete deliverables are concerned, advancements were made in three important areas; defence, energy and partnership in the Indo-Pacific. In the defence sector alone, the last three years have resulted in $70 billion worth of deals in bilateral defence aviation and technology sectors. During the visit, Trump finalised deals worth over $3.5 billion for six Apache attack helicopters worth $930 million and 24 Seahawk/Romeo helicopters worth $2.6 billion. India and the US also discussed the $1.9 billion deal for a missile defence system that would protect the Capital.

However, the bonhomie between the two leaders and the spectacle surrounding Trump’s visit overshadowed any sense of lost opportunity. On the trade front, although both sides showed confidence that an impending mega deal benefiting both the countries is around the corner, trade negotiations are not going to be easy. In fact, some of the steps from the US have signalled a hard negotiating position on trade — one that presses for greater market access in various sectors without reinstating our Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) status. The US also removed India from the list of developing nations that are exempt from investigations on whether they harm the American industry with unfairly-subsidised exports.

Besides, the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer cancelled his visit to India due to unresolved differences between the two sides. What may have persuaded the Trump administration to persist with the trade talks is the rapidly-shrinking trade deficit with India, especially with rising energy imports. As such, the once $30 billion trade surplus of India has shrunk to $16 billion, thanks to its increasing energy imports from the US in recent times.

Besides, the energy sector is coming up as one of the most important areas of cooperation between the US and India and in the last four years, bilateral energy trade has risen to $20 billion. During Trump’s visit, ExxonMobil signed a deal to improve India’s natural gas distribution network so that the US can export even more Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to us. In the likely absence of any concrete trade deal, there are primarily two areas on which the bulk of the performance weight of the bilateral relations would rest: Defence cooperation and regional order in the Indo-Pacific, which received a thrust during Trump’s visit to India. More importantly, the defence deals have a practical significance for the Indo-Pacific region and are mutually reinforcing, given India’s security considerations in the region.

The 24 MH-60R Seahawk maritime helicopters by US-based Lockheed Martin are one of the best naval choppers today with anti-submarine capabilities, a feature that is expected to give more strategic depth in the Indo-Pacific to the Indian Navy. These helicopters can also be used for other purposes like anti-surface warfare and search and rescue operations.

The six Apaches, armed with Stinger air-to-air missiles, Hellfire Longbow air-to-ground missiles, guns and rockets are likely to pack considerable air power for the Indian Army. In the defence sector, India and the US also agreed to work towards an early conclusion of the fourth and final bilateral foundational military pact called the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-Spatial Cooperation.

Furthering cooperation with India in the domain of the Indo-Pacific was a definitive plan of the Trump administration. This was depicted by the Blue Dot network push by him to rope India into the effort to “guarantee that the infrastructure of the future is built in a safe, transparent and accountable manner” in the Indo-Pacific region. Since countries like Australia and Japan are already partners to the Blue Dot network, India’s participation will further consolidate multilateral stakes there from a rules-based order perspective.

The Blue Dot network is intended to ensure that countries around the world have access to private sector-led, sustainable and trustworthy options for high-quality infrastructure development. India and the US will look to consolidate the common views of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific through this network. Convergences between the two nations are likely to grow, especially in the aftermath of the Raisina Dialogue 2020, where the US declared an expansive view of its Indo-Pacific strategy and included the Gulf in its vision for the region, which was hitherto excluded.

With China hit by an epidemic of unprecedented proportions, the consequences of which are yet to be assessed, the timing of Trump’s visit could be significant for the advancement of US-India combined views on the emerging Asian order. Trump’s visit was an important opportunity for both sides to take concrete steps in advancing the idea of the Indo-Pacific. While the Blue Dot network is an opportunity for India to embrace it, we need more clarity on its role in advancing the economic corridor as part of the regionally-envisaged connectivity vision.

The other critical issue to come up during Trump’s visit was the purpose and nature of the Quad partnership at the level of top leadership. These discussions were a natural follow-up after all four countries met at the ministerial level for the first time in a “significant elevation” of the dialogue advance cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region in September 2019. With Australia’s inclusion in the Malabar naval exercises around the corner, it is only imperative that the two largest powers in the region, which are counterpoised to China, consolidate on this combined regional security architecture.

On global issues, while the issue of terrorism stuck out, a backchannel talk on Afghanistan found its place in the bilateral agenda. The internal situation in Afghanistan is at the cusp of a transformation with a US-Taliban deal likely to be signed in a matter of days. It is no secret that Trump wants India to play a larger role in Afghanistan’s security. With the recent announcement of the official results of the Afghan elections and the return of the Ghani Government in Kabul, a party which India recognises, New Delhi’s support “to do more” may have been underscored yet again by Trump.

The US might be aware that Afghanistan’s National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib, who was in New Delhi in January, asked India to consider deploying its troops in Afghanistan in a peacekeeping role. While Prime Minister Modi may have conveyed India’s concerns over the US deal with Afghanistan, such concerns may have been diluted by the US’ counter-concerns on Kashmir, New Delhi’s controversial domestic legislations and the violence in parts of the Capital, even as Trump was in Delhi.

11,29-2-20,A deeper malaise,"The Delhi riots are proof that a section of young Indians has fallen off the edge of a crumbling nation and a feeble economy

Today’s national newspaper front pages have found a variety of ways to headline the riots across the Capital. Without exception, all featured unforgettable and frightening images of burning buildings and vehicles, billowing dark smoke, streets littered with stones and brick pieces, families crying over the loss of their loved ones and so on. Delhi’s rioters, I believe, are the products of a nation with a crumbling economy and an indifferent political class that has turned its back on them. No one seemed surprised at the headlines. Not the youngsters and teenagers fleeing home at dusk. Not Julfikar and Hari, who used to live in Chand Bagh and had returned to stand vigil over the stone-pelting and police vehicles littering an urban war zone. Julfikar claimed to have seen the whole thing coming. “This was always going to happen,” he says in a nonchalant manner and shrugs his slim shoulders.

The police shot a thin guy under very suspicious circumstances. A sturdy teenager shouted while brandishing a gun in his hands and pointing it at a policeman. Another young man got a bullet in his neck from the back, ending his life even before he could reach the nearest hospital. Feral kids with no jobs ran amok. To Hari’s mind, this was a riot waiting for an excuse.

In the aftermath of the violence that spread through Delhi, the uprisings seemed both inevitable and unthinkable. Over the last few days, physical attacks and verbal abuses, calling one another goons became a contagion in the capital of the world’s largest democratic nation, reverting the city to a Hobbesian dystopia of chaos and brutality.

This is the most arcane of uprisings and the most modern, too. Its participants, marshalled by YouTube videos and Twitter posts, are protagonists in a sinister flip side to the Arab Spring of the early 2010s. The Delhi Winter featured young people as young as teenagers in an assault on the established order of a benign democracy.

For many, one naïve question still hangs over Delhi’s battle-torn streets. How could this ever happen? Among several obvious answers, one, is a major failure of policing. The evidence so far points to more ignominy for the rudderless policemen, as doubts emerge over whether the youngsters who died on the spot sparked the initial riots? Whether they pelted stones at the policemen or some other miscreant lurking about the place did?

The apparent loathing, demonising and then appalling indifference of the powers that be, towards the protesters, leaving them at their state without any communication for months at a stretch, precipitated the crisis. The absence of officers or any intelligent intervention to reassure the protesters at Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Millia Islamia led to a breakdown of order as seen in these lawless badlands of a State failing in its administrative skills/performance.

Apparently, the second answer to the naïve question (why did it happen?) is the number of inciting hate speeches and myriad videos floating on various social media paltforms. Recall in particular the scathing utterances of a BJP party worker of questionable motive/IQ, threatening the young protesters already seething with the exclusionary implications of the Citizenship Amendment Act. In uneasy gatherings/societies, power to people or political party workers — whether offered or stolen — can be toxic, precipitating a crisis of this kind. We need more matured minds and party workers to deal with a situation like the present one.

Someone has said, these are not communal riots in the streets of Chand Bagh, Jafrabad, Bhagalpur, Gopalpur and Maujpur, where the Marwari grocery, the Mughlai biryani shop and the Sikkimese hairdresser’s salon sit side by side. The real causes are more insidious. It is no coincidence that the worst violence that Delhi has seen in many decades has taken place against the backdrop of a global economy poised for a freefall.

Mob violence is always despicable; inexcusable, must always be condemned. But those terrorising and trashing Delhi are also a symptom of a wider malaise. These riots are proof that a section of young Indians — the stabbers, shooters, looters, chancers and their frightened acolytes — have fallen off the edge of a crumbling nation. A country with a crumbling economy.

With unprecedented financial stress in the country’s households, the loss of jobs (6.2 million in 2011-12 to 15.5 million in 2017-18), the mammoth problem of joblessness (the unemployment rate rose to 8.8 per cent in 2017/18 from 3.3 per cent in 2011/12), the reality is grimmer that what appears on the surface. And it has direct repercussions on the youth that constitutes 70 per cent of the Indian demographic make-up. The failure of the markets goes hand in hand with human (most importantly young people) blight.

12,29-2-20,Green accounting is the need of the hour,"India must include the cost of ecosystem services in the daily life of a citizen and this can only be possible through a well-designed environmental auditing system that is customised for its needs, specific problems and latent opportunities

Environmental accounting or green accounting is a concept that calculates the cost of a nation’s economic impact on nature. In recent years, owing to rising pollution levels and climate change, the environment has been suffering in a major way. Therefore, calls for conducting green accounting on a strict and regular basis have been growing louder and stronger.

However, environmental accounting is nowhere near what it should be, as far as India is concerned. This is mainly due to the fact that the political parties and mainstream leaders are not highlighting the benefits of this outstanding concept and the potential role it can play in assessing the cost of a country’s development on its natural world.

As Mahatma Gandhi famously said, “Mother Earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s need, but not for every man’s greed.” This insightful observation alone is an indication of how relevant environmental accounting is in India’s context, as envisioned way back by the Father of the Nation. Sadly, the concept is yet to come of age in the country.

The spiralling costs of progress have been paid, time and again, by India. The 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy is one of the most painful examples of this. But, in spite of this, it is still a mystery how India is yet to measure the ecological costs we pay on a regular basis for the economic progress we log. Additionally, awareness among the masses is conspicuous by its absence as far as green accounting is concerned.

Thankfully, today’s world is no longer willing to be a mute spectator to Mother Nature being made to pay the cost of a nation’s growth and progress. Countries are exceedingly being watched and called out by the global community for environmental transgressions. Be it soil erosion, melting glaciers, the increasingly growing carbon footprint or deforestation, all these aspects are being diligently watched and documented by international conservation communities.

This in turn is now forcing nations across the world to adopt an inclusive approach towards economic development and ensure that industrial development is sustainable and in tune with the interests of the environment.

India must introduce a recharged and revamped system of environmental accounting that takes a comprehensive view of how a nation can progress without paying huge environmental penalties. This new accounting system must be end to end, so that it encapsulates the common man on one side and the Gross Domestic Product on the other. In between, it should be able to link and audit natural resources besides ensuring that the methodology of their use not only reduces wastage but also promotes and encourages their responsible recharge. This, done efficiently, can script a turnaround in how natural resources are used and promote accountability in their usage as well. Today, Indians are enjoying many of the benefits brought by economic progress but we are not entirely aware of their environmental costs. In our system of living, the environmental costs of a specific facility or a perk are not explicitly highlighted and neither are the people enjoying the facility or the perk tuned to its ecological footprint. This is not apathy nor ignorance, this disregard stems for the fact that the citizens have not been trained to respect the environment and understand its value.

Therefore, when the ecology suffers on account of some progress the same is neither reported nor quantified. So, the environment ends up sacrificing its present for India’s future. This is insensitive and unacceptable to say the least and must end forthwith. India must include the cost of ecosystem services in the daily life of a citizen and this can only be possible through a well-designed environmental accounting system that is customised for the nation’s needs, specific problems and latent opportunities. In order for India to be on the top of this initiative, it is critical that green accounting is included in every part of life, more so, in the corporate sector. The Government must also rely on technology and convey the environment cost of India’s progress to its citizens. This can be done by giving a ranking to each project, public or private, on its cost to the environment. This will not only educate people but also ensure that project managers become acutely aware of their responsibility to ensure ecologically accountable development.

13,29-2-20,UP Assembly adjourned sine die,"



|

In a sudden move, the Yogi Adityanath government on Friday rushed through the legislative business after which the Assembly was adjourned sine die, a week before schedule as per the agenda approved by the Business Advisory Committee of the House.

The Budget for 2020-21 along with 95 departmental grants were passed by the Assembly without debate. Through supplementary agenda, the government also introduced five bills and they too were passed without debate.

Opposition parties decried the government’s move saying, “The government wants to escape from its accountability towards people and deprive opposition parties of their fundamental right to scrutinise budget and move cut motion.”

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath countered the opposition charge saying, “The Budget session is confined to passing budget and the government is ready for a debate on the floor of the House on all issues.”

“Before pointing fingers at the government, the opposition should do some introspection and look up the record of the sessions of Assembly of the last 15 years when they were in power’’, the CM said.

“Like the three special sessions in 2019, I wish the Assembly will hold similar special sessions this year to in which different issues concerning the people will be taken up and all members will participate. We should take cue from traditions of parliamentary committees and make collective efforts to enrich the proceedings of the Assembly,” Yogi said.

Pointing to leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary, who was wearing a medical mask, Chief Minister said, “He can wear a mask but should not put cotton in his ears.”

Despite committing to participate, Chaudhary had boycotted the special session to commemorate the 150 birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi wherein sustainable development goals were discussed, a decision which he later regretted.

Yogi repeatedly teased the leader of opposition to remove the mask and speak on the issue of hike in MLA Local Area Development Fund and other issues, but Chaudhary refused to bite the bait.

Yogi said, “The leader of the opposition is against the hike in Vidhayak Nidhi. I wish there was a House committee to work out all issues related to utilisation of funds from Vidhayak Nidhi.”

On Thursday, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna had said that there was no move to curtail the Budget session and the session would continue till March 7, as per the agenda approved by Business Advisory Committee of the House.

While Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress members staged a noisy walkout from the House over the adamant stance of the government, principle opposition Samajwadi Party members kept sitting while wearing medical masks, depicting that their voices had been gagged.

As per Assembly Secretariat, there were 10 sittings of the House during the curtailed Budget session. The House was adjourned for 4 hours 16 minutes and total time of proceedings was 57 hours and 25 minutes.

The 2020-21 budget was presented in the House on February 18 and Governor Anandiben Patel inaugurated the session on February 13, with her address to the joint sitting of UP Legislature.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-assembly-adjourned-sine-die.html
14,29-2-20,UP govt rejects demand for caste-based census,"The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday rejected the demand of opposition parties for a caste-based census and for adding a caste column in the questionnaire of National Population Register (NPR).

The opposition demanded that the Assembly pass a resolution demanding caste-based census for ascertaining the share of Other Backward Classes in the population of UP.

“This is beyond the legislative competence and jurisdiction of UP Assembly as the issue as per the Constitution is in the Central list,” said Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna while opposing the demand.

Rejecting the opposition contention that UP Assembly should follow Bihar which has passed this kind of a resolution, Khanna said, “Bihar Assembly is no supreme court for us. We are not bound by a resolution passed by other state assemblies.”’

Leader of opposition and Samajwadi Party MLA Ram Govind Chaudhary said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised caste-based census so what prevents the UP government to implement it. Our sole demand is that UP Assembly should pass a resolution for caste-based census for ascertaining the share of OBCs in population of the state and a caste column be added in the NPR.”

Chaudhary said that a caste-based census would project a clear picture of the present population of OBCs and enable the government to provide them reservation in a transparent manner.

Bahujan Samaj Party leader Lalji Verma said, “The OBCs are getting reservation in three tier panchayati institutions and urban local bodies, and hence it was necessary to work out the exact share of OBCs in the state population.”

Om Prakash Rajbhar of Suheldeo Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) said that the government was ignoring the OBCs and threatened to stage a ‘dharna’ inside the Assembly if the demand for a caste-based census was not fulfilled.

On Wednesday too, Samajwadi Party had forced adjournment of the House for 50 minutes over the same issue during Question Hour.

Meanwhile, in another issue during Zero Hour, BSP member Uma Shanker Singh demanded that the Assembly have its own TV channel like Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to telecast live proceedings.

“Presently Doordarshan is doing the live telecast of House proceedings but it is only till 3 pm. A big state like UP and its Assembly should have a TV channel of its own,” Singh demanded through a notice which was rejected by the Speaker",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-rejects-demand-for-caste-based-census.html
15,29-2-20,Investors eager to set up industries in State: Nath,"Chief Minister Kamal Nath has said that investors are eager to set up industries in the state, encouraged by the resources available in Madhya Pradesh and better policies of the Government. Nath was on a visit to Asha Confectionery established as a result of the new investment policy in Indore Friday.

The Chief Minister said that with the help of people and entrepreneurs, industrial revolution will be brought in the state. He said that we are fortunate to have sufficient forests, minerals and human resources in our state. There is cultural diversity in the state. It is surrounded by five states, due to which there is no dearth of human resources and technical experts. The state has a favorable environment for the establishment of any industry, due to which the interest of the industrialists of the country has increased.

Kamal Nath said that apart from land, raw material, entrepreneurs and capital, there is a strong need of will power for the industry. Only a person with will power can reach the top. He said that the entrepreneurs of Indore and Pithampur have done remarkable work in the direction of employment, commerce and industry. It is easy to set up an industry, but network and marketing are the biggest challenges for the industries. The Chief Minister said that government is working to resolve this.

The Chief Minister congratulated Asha Daryani for the success of the confectionery. He hoped that the organization will inspire, train and guide unemployed youth to set up industries.

16,29-2-20,Theatre festival: Play staged,"A Hindi play 'Yahaan' was staged at Ravindra Bhavan on Friday. The play marked the conclusion of theatre festival.

The play is written and directed by Vinay Sharma. It was wonderfully performed by the artists of Padatik Theater, Calcutta.

Two women- twin souls- begin moving in a timeless space. They await any signs that may tell them who they will be next.

They find themselves entering the lives of other women in other times and places.

The play witnesses the thoughts and feelings of these women through different episodes: at times surreal or meta-real, these episodes are always rooted in the human need to connect with the Other and with oneself.

This play does not emphasise as much on story or character as on states of experience, extended moments, an instant or an anubhuti which seems to extend over days, years, lifetimes, ages. What ties them together is their exploration of the feeling or rasa of yearning. Now and again the words ruminate on aspects of time, space, light and breath, on the hidden and the revealed.

In some parts, the play is inspired by the spirit and essence of the writings in the Therigatha which is an anthology of poems in the Pali language by and about the first Buddhist women, composed more than two millennia ago; the Gathasaptasati.

Gathasaptasati is an anthology of Prakrit love poetry reputed to have been compiled by the Satavahana king Hala in the second century CE; and the Sufi lyrics of Bulle Shah, the iconic eighteenth-century Punjabi poet.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/theatre-festival--play-staged.html

28,29-2-20,Play staged to mark last day of theatre festival at Ravindra Bhavan,"The Hindi play ‘Vladimir Ka Hero’ marked the last day of a Bhopal National theatre festival on Friday at Ravindra Bhavan.

Manoj Nair, one of the renowned city playwrights is known for his unusual experiments in theatre world. He adapted the play from a short story by Leo Tolstoy ‘Good Sees the Truth but Waits’ and connected with a real life story of a theatre artist. First published in year 1872, this short story by Leo Tolstoy carries its contemporary essence even today.

Considered as one of the classic murder mysteries, it was brilliantly performed with an Indian swag by the artists of Shadow Group, Bhopal.

With the contemporary and symbolic stage design and wondrous light design the play was much enjoyed by the audience. The play comes with a twist for the audience.

The play shares a story of an old theatre artist Dayal. Dayal is 70 years old who is put in jail for a crime he never committed. Interacting with his inmates, Dayal shares his story and tells them about Ivon, whose story is similar to his.

Ivon was a merchant who lived in Valdimir. One day he decides to go in a business fair. On his way, he meets another merchant and had a good time with him at the rest house. As Ivon leaves for his home he is stopped by guards on his way. He was told that a merchant has been murdered and robbed. When the guards check Ivon’s possessions they find a blooded knife and arrests him.

For long 26 years Ivon was in jail for the crime he never committed.

The play then narrates the life journey of Dayal and eventually like Ivon it was revealed that he was not a criminal. But it was too late, for Ivon as well as for Dayal, as the characters dies.

The entire play was mesmerizingly portrayed on stage leaving the audience spell-bind.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/play-staged-to-mark-last-day-of-theatre-festival-at-ravindra-bhavan.html
29,29-2-20,Odisha to be taken to new heights in 5 years: Shah,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday termed Odisha as his “second home” and assured that the Narendra Modi Government would make all efforts to take the State to new heights during the next five years.

Addressing a huge pro-Citizenship Amendment Act rally here, Shah said the BJP has been so much strengthened in the Odisha that it has stood as a strong pillar in the whole eastern part of the country.

“With eight MP seats, our vote share in Parliamentary elections in Odisha has been increased from 21 per cent in 2014 to 38.4 per cent in 2019. The BJP got as many as 91 lakh votes compared to the BJD’s 1.1 crore votes. In Assembly sector, the BJP has also emerged second in Odisha. As the main opposition party, the BJP is now raising issues concerning people in the Assembly. Our party performed comparatively better in more about 14,000 booths out of total 36,000 booths,” he said.

Shah further said that Odisha people’s support inspired the BJP to grow further in the entire eastern region of the country. Putting a challenge to the Congress, Shah claimed that Odisha got highest amount of Central funds during the last five years of the first term of the Narendra Modi Government. “As compared to the Congress’s 55 years in power at the Centre, our five years remained much more supportive to Odisha,” claimed Shah.

He said the Modi Government provided a total of Rs 2,11,510 corore to Odisha during its first term against Rs 79,000 crore provided to the State by the Congress-led UPA-II Government. “Besides, we have given other projects worth Rs 3,00,000 crore during the period,” said Shah.

He said the Modi Government opened up development process in all sectors across the State. “Increase in funds for railway sector, farm loan support, increase in road net work, allotment a large number of houses under the Prime Minister Awas Yojana, distribution of LPG to over 47, 50,000 women under the Prime Minister Ujjwala Yojana, supply of electricity to 20,000 villages under Soubhagay Yojana, huge investment in petroleum sector, textile park at Bhadrak, a big budget for ST, SC and OBC people, inclusion of 3,24,000 crore people in the NFSA and establishment of a Paika Memorial and providing benefit to 41,00,000 people under the Mudra Yojana are our achievements,” he said.

The Modi Government’s support to Odisha would continue and all efforts would be made to bring overall development as it has been done in Gujarat, he said.

38,29-2-20,India needs stringent law to curb hate speech,"On February 24, northeast Delhi witnessed violent clashes between those who are pro-CAA-National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) and those who are anti-CAA, NPR, NRC. It is alleged that this happened shortly after Kapil Mishra of BJP demanded that, the roads blocked by those protesting against CAA be cleared by police immediately, and if his demands were not met, he would forcefully end the protests.

Such was the alacrity of his followers in acting upon his demands that, if allegations are to be believed, it actually incited the magnitude of the riots we have witnessed in northeast Delhi, in which as per reports 38 lives were lost and more than 200 are injured.

The tragedy is hate speech or lack of restraint in expressing opinions and voices while being in public life can be fatal to social order and harmony. However, hate speech is nowhere defined under the Indian law but it is best put under the European Union law as ""public incitement to violence or hatred directed to groups or individuals on the basis of certain characteristics, including race, colour, religion, descent and national or ethnic origin"".

In Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan versus Union of India (AIR 2014 SC 1591), the Supreme Court directed the Law Commission of India to define hate speech and recommend laws to curb the menace of hate speech in the context of speeches by politicians. Subsequently, in March 2017, the Law Commission submitted Report No. 267 titled, 'Hate Speech' which says, hate speech means ""an incitement to hatred primarily against a group of persons defined in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief and the like"". The report further states, ""Any word written or spoken, signs, visible representations within the hearing or sight of a person with the intention to cause fear or alarm, or incitement to violence.""

The commission in its report additionally recommended the addition of two more provisions in the IPC, which sought to criminalise hate speech. However, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 which was passed does not make any changes relating to hate speech.

But hate speech is admittedly an exception to the freedom of speech guaranteed under the Constitution and can be restricted under Article 19(2) of the Indian Constitution only when the speech reaches the threshold of incitement. However, speech which is merely offensive or unpopular is not to be restricted.

And accordingly provisions in law are pre-existing to contain such menace of hate speech. The provisions of the Indian Penal Code which criminalise hate speech are Section 153A which says that, ‘a person who uses words (written/spoken) which promote or attempt to promote disharmony/enmity/hatred/ill-will between different groups or castes or communities on grounds including religion, language or caste is liable to be punished, and further Sections 295A and 298 criminalise other forms of hate speech (These provisions criminalise acts intended to outrage the religious feelings of any individual or class.)

Historically, the problem of hate speech is mostly associated with irresponsible tendency present in political personalities to exploit social issues for political and personal gains. Let it be the Sikh riots of 1984 or demolition of Babri Masjid, it has always been associated with irresponsible statements made by political leadership, which has a role in inciting violence among their followers.

The problem of hate speech is further compounded when propagated by members of the Press and users of social media platforms. This is because unlike the situation where the person making a hate speech is a politician, media is expected to be neutral while reporting events and when media shows its bias, the ramifications of such hate speech becomes manifold and makes it further difficult for enforcement agencies to contain the situation.

It has been observed that, when prominent journalists hold unsubstantiated personal opinions during prime time shows, which has the potential to spread hatred and animosity in society, the effect of it penetrates each household, in short, causes a momentum of disharmony in the most obscure corners of the society. It often begins with fierce discussions in beetle shops and offices to riot like situations.

Apart from this, social media platforms are being widely used and exploited by various vested interest groups and political personalities and parties to spread social disharmony and animosity to gain cheap political dividends. The shocking part of the story is most of the youth and younger generations fall prey to such misinformation campaigns and act as agents of those, to whose loop they have unwittingly fallen prey to. But the price that the nation and society pay for the misadventures of such opportunist groups is quite hefty to be replenished.

It is not quite often that, the hate speeches are an inadvertent and passionate arousal of those who are making it, but if one keenly observes, it can easily be understood that it is part of a well planned and understood strategy to achieve which is otherwise difficult to achieve by political fair-play. Therefore, it is quite expedient to bring in a stringent legal regime to contain the malice of hate speeches both in public life and media platforms which includes print, electronic and social media and instil a sense of responsibility in the younger generations to understand the motive of the statements that often become viral in social media, that which could potentially do more harm than benefit to the interest of the nation and society.

39,29-2-20,ASI negligence: Konark temple statues damaged,"Even as a two-day workshop on the Sun Temple began at Konark on Friday, the sheer negligence of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in handling the affairs of the temple has already been exposed.

The ASI had recently patted itself on its back with a statement that the entire scaffolding around the temple has been removed. While removing the scaffolding on the eastern side of the temple, a statue was damaged. The knee of the five-feet Maithuna Couple was damaged and a large portion chipped off. This piece can be easily re-fixed, but due to the negligence of the ASI, it is not done. The damage is clearly visible from the ground level.

There were earlier instances too where such mishandling resulted in damage to fine sculptures. It has repeatedly been brought to the ASI’s notice that semiskilled workers are being used for the repairs.

Earlier on May 21 2019, the ASI apologised to the Jagannath Temple administration for the damage caused to its lion statues during Cyclone Fani. In that instance too, the iron scaffolding, put up by the ASI around the temple, had fallen on the lion statues when the cyclone hit. There were allegations that the scaffolding fell due to the ASI’s negligence.

The Union Minister for Culture had announced the present workshop during his last visit to Odisha and said the future restoration plans for the Sun Temple would be drawn up by attending archaeologists, engineers and other experts.

The last conference held to carry out an assessment of the Sun Temple’s structural stability was in 1997. Foreign experts had been roped in, but no action has been taken. The matter of the sand inside the Jagamohan, which has compacted to a level which is 17 feet below the roof; and the lateral thrust on the structural walls has been a matter of concern.

According to researcher Anil Dhir, general secretary of the Konark Suraksha Samiti, the ASI and the Government of Odisha should take active participation of local stakeholders while deciding conservation and restoration plans. Dhir, who was present during the meetings, held in 1997, 2010 and 2019, said none of the recommendations made in these meetings were implemented.

In December 2019, the then Union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma had categorically stated that there was absolutely “no threat” to this world heritage structure. At a high-level meeting at Bhubaneswar on December 10, the expert from the Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee too had certified that there was no threat to the Konark temple. But the temple’s world cultural heritage status certainly demands that the structure be given immediate attention, says Dhir.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/asi-negligence--konark-temple-statues-damaged.html
40,29-2-20,New Baleswar bus stand plagued by delay for 10 yrs,"Construction of a new bus terminal on the outskirts of the town has become a distant dream for the denizens of Baleswar. Although 10 long years lapsed ever since foundation stone was laid and the Balasore Regional Improvement Trust (BRIT) was entrusted with the job, yet no tangible result was seen.

The decision is taken by the district administration to shift the bus stand from the current Sahadevkhunta location outside the town in view of growing number of buses to the place at a time when there is no further scope of expansion of the stand due to space crunch.

For the new bus stand, a patch of 8 acres of land was identified near Januganj golai in Remuna and foundation stone for the project was laid by the Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on January 14, 2010.

The BRIT while acquired the patch in Rs 5.8 crore, yet it couldn’t proceed further due to paucity of fund.

In the meanwhile , even after a lapse of 10 long years, no progress is made. The patch of land has become a dumping ground and a few handful of people are carrying out their trades of sand, cement and bricks from the open patch, as it is open and unutilised.

Sources said from the BRIT, a proposal for Rs 11 crore expenditure for construction of the stand was given to the State Government and was approved too. For construction, drawing ,design and soil test too were conducted in the past. However, due to paucity of fund, the construction work couldn’t proceed.

Further, the proposal for construction was modified and as per new agreement, the expenditure would be borne at a ratio 80 and 20 by the State Government and BRIT respectively.

The State Government in first phase has released Rs 2 crore and placed with Works Department for construction.

Despite availability of fund, the work while couldn’t begin. In the meanwhile, the Chairman tenure is over and currently the district Collector is heading it.

The secretary of the BRIT couldn’t give any satisfactory reply for the delay.

As many as over 200 buses from the current venue at Sahadevkhunta while operate and ply to different destinations, congestion of buses and commuters has become a cause of concern. The residents expressing displeasure over the delay blame the apathetic attitude of the district administration for non execution of the much hyped important project of the district.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/new-baleswar-bus-stand-plagued-by-delay-for-10-yrs.html

44,29-2-20,Villagers complain about pollution by Aarti Steel,"The villagers of Mahakalbasta, Ghantikhal, Dhurusia, Dalabhaga, Khuntuni and Radhakishorpur gram panchayats around the Aarti Steel and Power Plant have alleged that coal particles mixed black coloured layer wrapped their agricultural fields and water bodies resulting in severe pollution and loss of paddy and vegetables production. The fertility of the soil is almost reduced and no pesticides and fertilizers can help in reviving plants

The air for a radius of at least 20 km remains so unhygienic and warm by which the human and animal population in the area suffer from multiple pollution related diseases. During the day time, people notice a light blue colour air in the nearby areas of the steel and power plant. The inferno emitting from its chimneys raises heat in the atmosphere and it is unbearable. The vacuum cleaner creates high noise pollution by which the pregnant women and the patients suffer a lot.

These apart, heavy dust generated by different coal and iron ore transportation adds to the miseries. The combustion of coal and other fossil fuels in the plant suspends sulfuric dioxide and carbon dioxide in the air which is poisonous for both the animal and plant population. As a result, several villagers are suffering from lungs, skin and kidney problems.

During installation of the company, people had thought that the company would give them employment facilities by which their per capita income would rise and they would live in peace. But after setting of the plant, its authorities played mischief with the locals and didn't give any direct recruitment. Rather, it engaged labourer contractors for the purpose. Most of the directly recruited employees are outsiders. By making this, the authorities are trying to deceive locals here, alleged sources.

This apart, as it has erected high fence around its assigned areas, the wild animals particularly elephants are disturbed.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/villagers-complain-about-pollution-by-aarti-steel.html

49,29-2-20,UT to conduct wildlife census,"Almost a decade after the first ever census of wildlife was conducted in city’s Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary, the UT Department of Forest & Wildlife is all set to carry out the census exercise for the second time in April this year.

Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary spreads over an area of about 26 sq km in the catchment area of the Sukhna Lake, which is Chandigarh’s prime tourist spot. The first census exercise in the Sanctuary was conducted in the year 2010.

The UT Department of Forest & Wildlife has sought assistance of Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun for conducting the census exercise and holding the training of UT employees for the purpose.

“The Department has decided to carry out the second census of wildlife in the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary in April this year.

He said, “Teams of experts will be constituted for the census. The UT staff will be trained on the methodology to be used for conducting the census exercise.”

For the wildlife census in 2010 also, the UT Department of Forest & Wildlife had roped in experts from WII, leading environmentalists, students from Panjab University’s Biology and Zoology Department and representatives from NGOs.

A three-day census exercise was conducted in 2010 in the Sanctuary and the teams had encountered 9 species of mammals and 65 species of birds.

At that time, direct evidences including the animals and mammals spotted in the area and indirect evidences like foot-prints and animal’s body waste was being considered to authenticate the presence of various inhabitants in the Sanctuary.

50,29-2-20,Kartarpur visitors quizzed in national security interest: Capt,"Defending the interrogation of four devotees on returning through Kartarpur Sahib corridor, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday made it clear that it was done on the request of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and he would have taken action against the Police officials for not doing that.

“In fact, had the Gurdaspur police failed to cooperate with IB in the wake of security concerns expressed by the latter, I would have taken strict action against them,” said the Chief Minister while responding to the issue raised by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan.

Capt Amarinder said that as the police force of a border state, the Punjab Police works closely with the central or intelligence agencies.

“In all, 51,000 pilgrims have gone there, and this is the first such instance of devotees being questioned. If the IB report says that these four persons be checked…what is wrong…the Punjab police has acted within the permissible limits of functioning in the matter,” said Capt Amarinder.

The Chief Minister’s Statement came a day after the Opposition created a ruckus in the House over the issue. The Opposition, while protesting over the issue on Thursday, had demanded a response from the Chief Minister, besides immediate dismissal and strict action against the state DGP.

“Punjab Government would cooperate with central agencies in the larger interest of the nation's security, as and when required.

If the police force fails to act in accordance with the established security mechanism in coordination with the central agencies, action would be taken against them,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kartarpur-visitors-quizzed-in-national-security-interest--capt.html
51,29-2-20,Time to unlearn & then learn for real,"The violence in Delhi brought various things to mind including wall paintings in Dehradun. It might seem illogical but there are similarities. The violence, deaths and mayhem caused in some parts of Delhi are deplorable to say the least. However, this should also be taken as a wake up call by sensible citizens. What one must realise is that the riots were the result or an effect of the real problems that have continued in society for decades. These problems and anomalies have been nurtured by politicians and other elements for many years for their dubious political and other gains while citizens remained apathetic.

Even after the riots and deaths, many are shamelessly peddling lies and hatred as part of their ulterior agenda. Sadly, many in the media and ‘intellectuals’ are also presenting highly biased views, twisted opinions and lies to present a distorted picture. There is much that one could say about the recent happenings in Delhi and its causes. Some believe that this is the time to elicit focus on various aspects of the real problem and its effects especially through the social media.

As a result various factually correct and many incorrect bits have flooded the social media. However, one thinks that this is not really the time to elicit focus on all the facts especially since we have often proven ourselves to be lacking in maturity needed to acknowledge facts with a cool head.

The general tendency quite popular these days is to express hatred and be judgmental or worse whenever someone presents facts not meeting ones beliefs. Even when facts are plain and simple to understand, there is a tendency to reject them if they do not suit the narrative one prefers. This proclivity is also one of the factors which led to the situation in Delhi.

However, there are times when the effects of this weakness to ignore facts are presented in aesthetically pleasing forms. Take the example of the wall paintings by various artists on some walls in Dehradun as part of the smart city project. Some of the paintings done for beautification of the city are quite good. However, does one wonder why we needed wall paintings for beautifying the city? Traditionally, in this mountain state, the local architecture is such that homes and other buildings are aesthetically pleasing and full of art and craft.

There is greenery around too. Hence, there was little or no need to paint walls in public places as is being done in Dehradun. Till some decades ago, most parts of this city had greenery and homes that were either aesthetically designed or at least did not appear ugly. But slowly, unplanned urbanisation was facilitated to replace green and open spaces with constricted clusters of mostly ugly and gaudy cemented structures marring a once beautiful city.

Just like the factors which resulted in the Delhi violence, the unplanned urbanisation and environmental degeneration in Dehradun was criticised by some only to be met by negation and negligible or ineffective corrective measures.

In the case of Delhi, the anomalies resulted in violence and deaths while in the case of Dehradun the effects appear different and also aesthetic in some instances like the wall paintings. The more damaging effects will start to hurt more in a few years. The establishment at the national level and in the state are either planning or undertaking some measures to address the issues.

However, in the case of Dehradun, sops like wall paintings and some additional benefit for those constructing the facade of their building using native architectural designs might be too little too late.

Still, all is not yet lost either in Delhi or in Dehradun. What is needed is to unlearn the fallacies that have been planted in the minds of citizens. We need to learn facts and practical realities, and work accordingly unless we wish to get stuck in a cycle of violence and damage to which we react after it is done instead of preventing it in the first place.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/time-to-unlearn---then-learn-for-real.html

53,29-2-20,Folk play staged at Tribal Museum Auditorium,"The Chhattisgarhi folk saga 'Dasmat' folk play was staged on Friday at Madhya Pradesh State Tribal Museum Auditorium. The play was staged under Uttaradhikar series. The play was directed by Rakesh Tiwari (Raipur).

According to the folklore, King Bhoj has an ego that the subjects of his kingdom believe that all live and eat on the fate of the king. But the king's younger daughter, Dasmat, believes that she eats her own fate.

On this, the king gets angry and marries Dasmat with a worker named Sudan. With the passage of time, one day the laborer husband of tenamat digging the pond ""Jogni Pathara"" which is a real diamond, which is recognized by the tenant moneylender takes its fair price and the family of tenmat is completed.

Now Raja Bhoj gets into a state of poverty in the change of time, then Dammat gives full respect to his father and goes to 'Dhauranagar' state to dig a pond with the working group.

Raja Mahanadeva of Dhauranagar, bewitched on the form of tenamat, proposes marriage, but the working class people refuse the marriage, telling the king the whole truth, but when the king becomes insistent the head of the group stipulates that if the king is his Marriage is possible only if we consume alcohol and pork according to caste and tradition.

The king accepts the condition. The king is fed with wine and meat and tied in a cot and transported to another kingdom at night.

When the king regains consciousness, he learns that his prince, sons and queens are unhappy with his behavior and do not want to enter the palace anymore, then the king becomes very sad and sets out on a divine vision with the sages but the way when he is seen digging the pond, the working group changes his views again and he once again calls and threatens to marry Dacamat.

The head of the group asks him to marry after worshiping 'Sabal'. During this puja, tenamat runs to King Mahanadev with a sabbatical form of divine power, then King Mahanadev runs away after getting scared and lives.

The presentation of this saga prevalent among the Dewar and Yadav communities in Chhattisgarh was prepared in a theatrical form that left the audinece mesmerised.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/folk-play-staged-at-tribal-museum-auditorium.html

59,29-2-20,Doctors vacant posts: Stir in Baliapal from March 3,"RTI activists of Baliapal block have threatened to embark on an indefinite agitation from March 3 demanding filling of vacant posts of doctors and paramedics.

Alleging the poor health services in the block, they told the block had only six doctors against 20 sanctioned posts in the seven CHCs and PHCs.

Despite several appeals and earlier agitations and assurances by the authorities, while the situation has remained unchanged, they decided to launch the agitation for an indefinite period in front of the Idco Hospital from Tuesday till fulfillment of their demands.

A decision in this regard was taken by the activists led by their president Anuj Kumar Mohapatra.

They besides stating that the doctors and paramedics posts were lying vacant since years, they also said previously they agitated in different forms including holding a road picketing and hunger strike etc. on September 15,2018 , October 10, 2018 and latest on February 14 , 2019.

Although last year, the then Chief District Medical Officer had assured that the vacancies would be filled within a month yet it was in vain, they alleged.

They further alleged that the rural health service received a jolt as some CHCs and PHCs were running without doctors. There is no doctor in 5 PHcs including Ghantua, Jamkunda, Srirampur , Langaleswar and Bolang. In the Pratapur CHC there are only three doctors against vacancies of eight.

Most importantly, the block headquarters hospital (CHC) known as Idco Hospital doesn’t have required number of doctors where at least 300 patients visit daily. In the CHC, posts of gynecology, surgery and medicine were lying vacant. One pediatrician was managing the show as in –charge doctor of the CHC .

The activists observed that while the Government was insisting on the institutional delivery, in the want of doctor, the nurses were performing doctors' duties. As a result un-time death of newborn was taking place, they alleged.

Further, they said that the patients were not getting dental care service as there was no infrastructure.

CDMO Banarjee Prasad Chhotray said that the staff position had been informed to the State Government, urging to fill the vacant posts.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/doctors-vacant-posts--stir-in-baliapal-from-march-3.html

61,29-2-20,Opp dubs Budget as aimless,"Congress slammed the Haryana budget, presented by Chief Minister M L Khattar in the Assembly here, saying it disappoints all sections of the society.

Expressing concerns over the state debt, pegged at nearly Rs 1.98 lakh crore, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said there has been a three-fold increase in debt in the past five years.

""This means, in an average, every Haryanvi now carries a debt of Rs 80,000 on his head. This budget will push the state deeper into debt,"" he said.

A former chief minister, Hooda said there is nothing in this budget which will please any section. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala called it an anti-people budget.

""It is a hopeless, anti-people, debt-ridden and zero-performance budget,"" he said, adding that the BJP-led government has pushed Haryana to the verge of bankruptcy. He said the debt has increased by nearly 280 per cent in five years.

Surjewala said the Haryana budget gave ""zero hope"" to the youth and asked why it did not mention how many jobs it would create as the state had the ""highest unemployment rate in the country at 28.7 per cent"". Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja said the budget disappoints every section.

""There is nothing in this budget for the youth, farmers, Dalits or any other section,"" the senior Congress leader said, expressing concerns over the state''s ""mounting debt"". Hooda demanded that the BJP-JJP government issue a white paper on the state of the economy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/opp-dubs-budget-as-aimless.html

The State Government spokesperson and senior Cabinet Minister, Madan Kaushik said that doors of talks with the employees are open. He said that the strike is not the solution of any issue. The minister however added that senior officers of administration have been asked to remain vigilant and make alternate arrangement in case of the strike.

It is learnt that the Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat can meet the agitated employees at his residence on Saturday. The Government can also invoke the provisions under Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) to declare the strike illegal.

The president of the Rajya Karmchari Saiyukt Parishad, Thakur Prahlad Singh said that representatives of many states would arrive in Dehradun on Saturday to hold discussion with the office bearers of the association of Uttarakhand on the issue. He added that the association has also sought time from chief minister for a meeting on the day.

It is worth mentioning here that the Budget session of Uttarakhand Assembly is commencing from March 3 at Gairsain and employees have decided to go on strike, a day earlier. While hearing a Special Leave Petition (SLP) of Uttarakhand Government the Supreme Court (SC) on February 7 had opined that the states are not bound to provide reservation in promotions and said that the reservation is not a fundamental right.

The division bench of justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and justice NS Dhanik stayed the government order dated February 19, 2020 while hearing a PIL challenging the same on Friday.

Ajay Rawat, Vinod Pande and others had filed a PIL in the high court challenging the Government’s order removing less than five hectare forested land from the deemed forest classification.

However, after the earlier order was stayed by the high court, the State Government amended its earlier order to make it applicable to less than five hectare area.

The petitioners have also stated that as per the Forest Conservation Act, about 71 per cent of the state’s area is forest area in which forests have been classified into different categories though there are some areas which have not been placed under any category.

Such areas should also be classified under forest category to prevent exploitation of loss of such areas.

The petitioners also cited the 1996 Supreme Court order in the Godavarman versus the Union of India and others in which the apex court had stated that any forest area irrespective of the ownership should be classified into forest categories, adding that the definition of forests should not depend on area or density.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hc-stays-govt-order-on-status-of-less-than-5-hectare-forested-land.html
64,29-2-20,"High voltage drama, Manpreet Badal couldn't reach in time","In a scene straight out of the Bollywood flick, Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal on Friday made a sudden appearance in Punjab Vidhan Sabha after being held back by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders and the families of farmer suicide victims virtually laying a siege at his official residence.

Manpreet, who was scheduled to reach the Vidhan Sabha at 10:30 am to present the budget at 11 am, reached seconds before the Speaker Rana KP Singh adjourned the House for 20 minutes to take up the matter with UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore, who is also Punjab Governor.

This is for the first time in the recallable history that the House has to be adjourned before the presentation of the budget because the Finance Minister could not reach on time.

SAD MLAs and leaders, along with the families of farmer suicide victims, staged a protest outside the Finance Minister’s house in Sector 2, blocking the entrance to prevent him from reaching the Assembly on time.

Intervening during the question hour, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Brahm Mohindra informed the Speaker about the situation and demanded his intervention. “An ugly situation has arisen as the UT Police had not been able evict the Akalis…either you give directions to the Punjab Police or allow us,” he said, adding that delaying the presentation of the budget also amounts to breach of privilege of the House.

Sensing urgency of the unprecedented situation, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh discussed the issue with Mohindra and the Jails Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa.

As Manpreet failed to reach the House even after the conclusion of the question hour, soon after which he was scheduled to present the budget, the Speaker adjourned the House for 20 minutes. However, Manpreet entered the Assembly just two minutes before he was to present the budget.

As the House resumed, Mohindra moved the privilege motion against the all the Akali MLAs saying that they indulged in breach of privileges for “obstructing” the work of Finance Minister and all the members on the day he was to present the budget, which was unanimously passed, and the matter has been referred to the special privileges committee of the House.

Lashing out the Akalis, Capt Amarinder, in a statement, said that their sole objective was to prevent the Government from continuing to work for the welfare of the state and its people. “The Akalis, who had been responsible for destroying the state’s economy during the 10 years of their misrule, have clearly wanted to divert public attention from the progressive budget with these actions,” he added.

SUSPEND AKALIS FOR THE REMAINING SESSION: MINISTERS

Several Cabinet Ministers also condemned the “hooliganism” by the Akali workers and legislators outside Manpreet’s residence.

“Akalis should be ashamed of trying to use the family members of the suicide victims for scoring political points. It is outrageous and shameful that the Akalis are trying to make political capital out of tragedies of farmers’ suicides and shamelessly parading their family members for petty gains,” said the Ministers including Brahm Mohindra, Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Balbir Sidhu and Sukh Sarkaria.

They said that it was “unprecedented” that the Akali legislators supported by goons held Manpreet Badal hostage and prevented him from coming out and reaching the Punjab Vidhan Sabha on time.

“For the first time in history, the House has to be adjourned for 20 minutes just because the Finance Minister could not reach the Vidhan Sabha on time as he had been held hostage by the Akali goons and legislators who were not letting him to come out,” they said while welcoming the unanimous privilege motion passed against the Akali MLAs in the Vidhan Sabha and demanded that they must be suspended for the rest of the session.

MANPREET SHOULD HAVE LISTEN TO VICTIMS’ GRIEVANCES

Condemning Manpreet Badal and the Chandigarh Police for resorting to ‘gundagardi’ to stifle farm suicide victim families’ voice, SAD legislative party wing leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon and MLA Bikram Singh Majithia said that rather than listening to their grievances, Finance Minister ordered the Chandigarh police to remove them forcibly resulting in highhandedness against old men and women, children and even handicapped persons.

“SAD-BJP MLAs were also targeted in a planned manner and manhandled deliberately at the instance of the Finance Minister who has violated their privilege…The MLAs were detained deliberately for the entire duration of the budget session as well as till such time the Finance Minister’s press conference was not over.

This is for the first time in the history of Punjab that opposition legislators have been prevented from participating in the budget session in such a manner. This is indeed a black day in the history of the Vidhan Sabha,” they said.

Majithia alleged that the Finance Minister “enacted a drama of reaching late for the assembly” as the Chandigarh Police had lifted victim families and legislators from the spot at 10.45 am.

“He could have even walked to the Vidhan Sabha in 15 minutes but he deliberately reached late as part of a well-planned conspiracy to get a privilege motion initiated against SAD-BJP legislators. We are not scared by such tactics and will continue to gherao the Finance Minister till the Congress Government fulfills its promise to waive of all loans of suicide victim families besides disbursing Rs 10 lakh compensation and a government job to one family member,” he said.

Later, five-time Chief Minister and SAD patron Parkash Singh Badal rushed to the police station to offer solace to detained farm suicide victim families.

Expressing shock at the police action, he said that it amounted to “murder of democracy”. “Only in a feudal set up did rulers behave with their aggrieved subjects in such a manner…Such an incident has never happened in the history of the state,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/high-voltage-drama--manpreet-badal-couldn-t-reach-in-time.html

75,29-2-20,MCD to treat 10 lakh metric tonnes of garbage on old trenching ground,"Machines with trommel to separate materials would be set up on the old trenching ground on Sahastradhara Road by the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) to treat about 10 lakh metric tonnes of garbage. According to the officials, for now the focus is on levelling the five bigha portion of the ground for construction of the Sainya Dham.

The old trenching ground has a thick layer of garbage above the ground. The non-biodegradable wastes like plastics are stuck in between the layers of soil and biodegradable waste which is difficult to segregate and treat in about one year. However Dehradun municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey said that the treatment and disposal of garbage from the old trenching ground will take only a couple of years with the help of bioremediation.

According to Pandey, “The garbage in the trenching ground will be treated with the help of bioremediation. In this procedure, initially, the garbage at the ground is being accumulated in a single place. After the accumulation, the machines with trommels will be set up there to treat the garbage which will separate the trash into three forms.”

He said that the three forms would be compost, Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) and inert waste out of which the first two items will be sold or disposed by MCD whereas the inert waste will be dumped in the solid waste management and recycling plant in Sheeshambada after its proper treatment. The whole procedure of clearing the old trenching ground will take about one or two years, he added.

According to the MCD assistant engineer Ved Prakash Badhani, “The garbage is getting collected on a lower level land near the old trenching ground and then the procedure of recycling the garbage will also begin. For now, our focus is on clearing and levelling the five bigha land where Sainya Dham is proposed to be built.” He further said that the procedure will be carried out on whole of the old trenching ground. The procedure of capping technique will also begin after the land is levelled.

The municipal commissioner informed that a team of experts in bio-mining has arrived in the city and after the inspection of the old trenching ground; they will suggest the best methods by which the garbage on the ground can be processed and treated.

A team of non governmental organisation Waste Warriors is also working on the old trenching ground in association with MCD. According to the group’s manager Naveen Kumar Sadan, “We are picking up the plastics, polythene and other kinds of waste which haven’t mixed with the dirt yet and can still be recycled. The garbage which gets mixed with soil and dirt is hard to process, that is why we are picking up the garbage at the surface only. We will recycle it in our waste material recycle centre in Dehradun.”

It is pertinent to mention here that a Sainya Dham and a public park are proposed to be developed on the old trenching ground.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-to-treat-10-lakh-metric-tonnes-of-garbage-on-old-trenching-ground.html

95,29-2-20,Herbal hues this Holi,"The festival of colours is right round the corner. And here is an opportunity to celebrate Holi by replacing the traditional gulal with its more eco-friendly and natural counterpart.

People are preparing to turn red, blue and yellow with the festival of colours. City markets are witnessing enthusiastic crowd.

The Bistupur and Sakchi market are most sought after place to buy the colours. A number of people frequent these markets for the festival of the year and a dozen odd shops sell different variants of colours. It is also a choicest place for the children to buy toys that can store in some color water.

“Holi has always been a nightmare for me because of the dangers of synthetic colours. Eco-friendly colours are the best way to celebrate Holi. Thanks to the annual awareness drives, gradually, people are realising the importance of eco-friendly colours,” said Amala Akkineni.

The rising awareness about the ill effects of the synthetic colours have motivated people to opt for the natural colours or to say eco friendly colours to play and enjoy the festival of colours, Holi.

“The colours are made out of turmeric, rice flour and recycled flowers, and contain no artificial colours. Fillers or preservatives that are used have been lab tested for zero heavy metal content,” said Radheshyam Goyal, a leading colour trader of Jugsalai.

Ranging from Rs 10 a packet to Rs 260 per kilogram, these natural colours may be a little heavy on the pocket as compared to the regular colours, but the difference is a small price to pay for a safe Holi.

“Regular colours can cost anything between Rs 100-200 per kilogram. However, as natural colours have a higher density, the buyer gets a higher amount for less,” Goyal added.

For Mukesh Agarwal, a shopkeeper at Sakchi Market, personalized gift baskets for Holi are a sure-shot way to up business at this time.

""The designer masks have found many takers. Even though the demand for pakka colours has seen a dip, we have a few packets kept with us. Kuch log aise hote hain jo kehte hain ki do din tak toh lagna chahiye ki Holi kheli hai.

That's why they prefer pakka colours to organic Holi colours.

But at the end of the day, it's all a traders of the city who experimented with herbal holi colours last year doubled the orders this year but almost the entire stock has been sold out a week before the festival.

“Though, the sales of rose waters are also on its pick and the products are very reasonably priced at Rs 20-25 for a herbal colour pouch and Rs 75-80 for a rose water bottle,” said Manoj, a trader.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/herbal-hues-this-holi.html

The budget session commenced on Friday at the new Assembly building. Chief Minister Hemant Soren, Speaker Rabindra Nath Mahto and parliamentary affairs minister Alamgir Alam inaugurated the budget session by unveiling the plague at the entrance of Assembly building.

101,29-2-20,Marginalised communities at higher risk of mental illnesses: Guv,"The vulnerable and disadvantaged segments of the society remain at a much greater risk of experiencing marginalisation and are especially susceptible to falling prey to mental illnesses and substance addiction, Governor Droupadi Murmu said on Friday.

While addressing the inaugural ceremony of a three-day conference on ‘Social Work Practice: Emerging Trends & Challenges’ at the Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP) in Ranchi, Murmu said, “Our changing way of life, with fast-paced urbanization and the weakening of the traditionally-strong family bonds are some of the important causes of social disorders. While in rural communities the problems of poverty, social exclusion and marginalization greatly increase stress, these communities have reduced access to opportunities.”

The conference marks the Golden Jubilee of the Department of Psychiatric Social Work at the CIP.

It also marks the completion of 50 years of the Indian Society of Professional Social Work (ISPW) – a national conglomerate of psychiatric social workers and doctors constituted in Ranchi half a century ago.

“Professional social workers have a huge responsibility to spread awareness about these issues, to educate the public and to help facilitate access to various government programs that can help those in need. Social workers also play a vital role in enabling non-governmental organizations to play a meaningful role in mitigating problems in local communities,” said the Governor.

Psychiatric social work is a field of psychiatry that helps mental health patients reintegrate in the society after their treatment is over.

This process requires expert guidance due to the stigma and superstitions related to mental illnesses in India, especially the rural society, said doctors.

A psychiatric social worker also helps patients cope with unfavourable social conditions that may aggravate their mental illnesses.

These professionals study the social settings of a patient, help him or her adjust in it, and also spread awareness about the various mental health concerns.

The conference saw participation of psychiatrists and psychiatric social workers from across the country on Friday. The delegates shared their views and also spoke about ways to deal with the dearth of psychiatric social workers in the country. One of the objectives of the conference is to identify the challenges in the process and find ways to address them, said doctors from the institute.

CIP Director Dr. D Ram said that there are four pillars supporting the larger umbrella of psychiatry. The four, he said, are psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychiatric social workers and psychiatric nurses. He added that in order to achieve success in effectively addressing mental health issues, the society and the medical fraternity needs a healthy balance of all the four pillars.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/marginalised-communities-at-higher-risk-of-mental-illnesses--guv.html

104,29-2-20,CM Baghel writes to Union food minister urging to purchase 31 LMT rice from C’garh,"Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has requested Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan to purchase 31 lakh tons rice from state for the central pool.

In a letter written to Paswan, Bagel while citing a provision of MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) signed between Chhattisgarh and Union government said that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) can purchase all surplus rice from a state.

“During the financial marketing year 2019-20, 82.80 lakh tons paddy was purchased from 18.20 lakh farmers in Chhattisgarh,” Baghel said in the letter.

While pointing towards loan waiver by his government, Baghel said that due to loan waiver of about 4 lakh farmers, most of them had again registered for selling paddy. So, this year paddy purchase jumped to 82.80 lakh tons from 80.38 lakh tons last year.

The Chief Minister citing permission granted by Union food ministry for purchasing 24 lakh tons usna rice in central pool said that 55.86 lakh tons rice will be produced from 82.80 lakh tons paddy in marketing year 2019-20.

“State PDS will need 25.40 TMT rice while the remaining 30.46 TMT rice will be surplus. Out of surplus rice 24 TMT rice will be purchased by the FCI. However, about 6.66 MT rice worth Rs 1500 crore will remain unutilized,” he said while urging the Union minister to increase rice procurement from Chhattisgarh from 24 lakh tons to 31 lakh tons.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-baghel-writes-to-union-food-minister-urging-to-purchase-31-lmt-rice-from-c---garh.html
105,29-2-20,"Opp inciting riots over CAA, alleges Shah","Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday accused opposition parties of spreading misinformation about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and inciting communal riots.

He said people should come out and ask those fomenting trouble to explain which clause of the CAA would snatch citizenship of people.

Shah was addressing a big rally organised by the BJP at the Janata Maidan here in support of the CAA.

“Opposition parties are spreading misinformation that Muslims will lose their Indian citizenship because of the CAA. They are instigating people and fomenting riots,” he alleged.

He said no Indian Muslim would lose citizenship because of the new law.

“Lakhs of people belonging to minorities communities like Hindu, Jain, Parsi and Sikh have been suffering from religious persecution in neighbouring countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan for the last 70 years since partition. They have lost their human rights. Earlier Congress leaders had promised citizenship to them during fifties. But they didn’t do anything in this regard. Narendra Modi took the step to protest them,” said Shah. He criticised Communist, Congress, SP, TMC and other opposition parties for “spreading misinformation”.

Shah said the Modi Government at the Centre has addressed several intractable issues that had festered for 70 years, including repeal of provisions of Article 370 that gave a special status to Jammu and Kashmir and prevented its integration with the rest of the country.

He said constitution of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Trust for establishment of a Ram Temple at Ayodha is another historic step taken by the Government.

106,29-2-20,Balakot air strikes sent clear message on terrorism: Rajnath,"Highlighting the importance of air power, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said the Balakot air strikes had sent out the clear message that infrastructure across the border could not be used as safe havens for terrorists.

Addressing a seminar here on ‘Air Power in No War, No Peace Scenario,’ he also hailed the 40 Central Reserve Police Force(CRPF) martyrs of the Pulwama terror attack and saluted the soldiers who carried out the Balakot air strikes.

Air Chief Marshal RK S Bhadauria said in the seminar the use of air force in the sub-conventional domain was considered a “taboo” in the past and Balakot air strike is a “paradigm shift.”

Hailing the Government’s decision to carry out the Balakot strikes, Bhadauria said it was a “tough and bold decision to strike at the heart of terrorist training camps deep inside Pakistan across the Line of Control”.

Stressing the need for operational readiness, the defence minister said it is important to maintain credible deterrence at land, air and sea at all times.

Chief of Defence Staff(CDS) General Bipin Rawat said the clear message from the Balakot strikes was that the kind of “proxy war” perpetrated on India “will not be tolerated”.

On February 26 last year, IAF jets targeted a Jaish-e-Mohammad(JeM) camp across the LOC in Balakot in retaliation to the killing of 40 CRPF personnel in Pulwama on February 14 in a suicide attack.

Singh said the security scenario had changed in the last few years and incidents of cross border terrorism are examples of the new warfare that has forced the rewriting of doctrines across the border.

Kargil and incidents of cross border terrorism are examples of new kind of warfare. Hybrid warfare is the reality of present day.

There is no clear beginning and end in this changing scenario of conflict, he said. He said India’s adversary on the Western border will have to think 100 times before considering about any future “misadventure”.

The “out-of-the-box” response in the form of Balakot airstrikes following the Pulwama terror attack last year forced rewriting of many doctrines by the adversary across the LoC, Singh said without naming Pakistan.

Addressing the seminar, Bhadauria said, “This (Balakot) was a clear demonstration that there exists a space within the sub conventional conflict boundary wherein Air Force can be used for targeting and yet have escalation control.” Use of air power was discussed in the past but most suggestions in this regard were negative and it was decided better not to use, he stated.

Rawat highlighted the significance of “credible deterrence” in warfare and said it comes from keeping every personnel trained and motivated. He also said deterrence comes from the will of the military leadership and intent of political leadership while taking the tough decision.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/balakot-air-strikes-sent-clear-message-on-terrorism--rajnath.html
107,29-2-20,Edu aims to produce good human beings: Prez,"President Ramnath Kovind on Friday said that the actual purpose of education should be to produce good human beings, who would go on to make the society a better place for everyone. A good human being, he said, will become a good teacher, a good doctor, and even a good politician.

Addressing the maiden Convocation ceremony of Central University of Jharkhand (CUJ) at its permanent campus in Kanke, Kovind said that the need of the hour was to understand the most important purpose of education – to create noble human beings. “Education not only decides your profession but also life in general.

A good human being will also become a good son, a good husband and a good father.

Similarly, a good human being will also become a good daughter, a good wife, a responsible mother and a great daughter-in-law,” he said.

Established in 2009, CUJ operated out of a temporary campus in Brambe for more than a decade before getting a permanent campus. The university will move to its permanent campus this year. By now, as many as 2263 students have passed from the university, the Vice Chancellor of CUJ Nand Kishore Yadav Indu said on Friday. At present, as many as 2261 students are pursuing various courses in the university and around 50 per cent of them were women, he added.

“I appreciate the fact that despite all the road blocks, the university has finally got a permanent campus. Even if a train is running late, once it catches its optimum speed, we can expect it to reach all the stations on time,” Kovind said, reacting to the history of hurdles faced by CUJ in getting a permanent campus in Ranchi. “After so many years, the university is holding its first convocation ceremony, and this deserves appreciation,” he added.

As many as 639 students from different disciplines attended the Convocation ceremony on Friday in presence of the President of India, Jharkhand Governor Droupadi Murmu and CUJ Vice Chancellor. Kovind conferred certificates to at least 16 gold medalists on Friday, and appreciated the growing dominance of women in academic excellence. “The university has by now produced 96 gold medalists, and 64 of them are girls. Only 32 are boys. We have a ration of 1:2 here, which is incredible,” he said.

Kovind on Friday stressed on the importance of social work by students and universities. He reiterated that on the lines of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) universities should start University Social Responsibility (USR). Under USR, he said, students and institutions should spread awareness among residents of neighbouring villages, impart education to them and eradicate social evils. “I am glad to know that CUJ has adopted five villages as a part of its social responsibility,” he said.

Talking about women empowerment, the President said that the Government of India is planning to come up with schemes to encourage more participation of girls in the field of science and technology. “The fact that girls dominate in the list of gold medalists in almost all the universities paints a golden picture of the country. Women have to face more obstacles and despite this they are doing well in academics. This is commendable,” he said. However, girls lag behind in the field of science and technology, and to address this, the Government is coming up with new schemes, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/edu-aims-to-produce-good-human-beings--prez.html
108,29-2-20,Sonia deputes 5-member team to visit riot-hit areas,"Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday deputed a five-member team to visit the riot-affected areas in northeast Delhi and submit a report to her after assessing the situation there. The Congress, for its part, slammed the BJP for attacking Sonia chief over her ‘Rajdharma’ remarks, saying its leaders like Indira Gandhi and Manmohan Singh believed in equality and harmony, while the Modi Government has a “divisive mindset”.

The five-member team comprises AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik, AICC in-charge Delhi Shaktisinh Gohil, Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja, former MP Tariq Anwar and Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev.

The team has been asked to submit a “detailed report to the Congress president immediately”, the Congress said in a statement. Later, the Congress leaders who are part of the team held a meeting at the party headquarters here.

The Congress slammed the BJP for attacking Sonia Gandhi over the party’s ‘Rajdharma’ reminder after Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad hit out at the Congress president asking her “don’t preach us Rajdharma”.

The BJP’s remarks came a day after the Congress leaders, led by Sonia Gandhi, met President Ram Nath Kovind and submitted a memorandum demanding resignation of Union Home Minister Amit Shah for “abdication of duty” during the communal violence in northeast Delhi.

The party also reminded the Centre for its ‘Rajdharma’.”Indira ji, Rajiv ji, Manmohan Singh ji’s Rajdharma, was that Rajdharma, in which equality, harmony was given priority. What you are doing, there is prejudice in that; there is a divisive mindset,” the Congress posted on its official Twitter handle.

Congress Spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi asserted that the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) are linked with the additional questions being added to the NPR.

Singhvi’s assertion came after Prasad alleged that the communal violence in northeast Delhi was an outcome of “instigation” by Opposition leaders.

Prasad said the NPR was started by the Congress-led regime. “If Congress does something, it is good. But if we do the same thing, they provoke the people. What type of raj dharma is this?” he asked.

Hitting back at Prasad, Singhvi said, “Arrest all of us because we are speaking peacefully in a democratic country against what we believe is a wrong move. I am saying it right now and daring anyone to arrest me, that the NRC is wrong.”

“If you thing that is sedition. If you think that is anti-national. If you think that is provocation and incitement. I think it is a matter of shame if we have to live in a country where this free speech without violence, peaceful protest without violence is so treated,” he said.

Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also hit out at the BJP over Prasad’s remarks on NPR and asked why he doesn’t implement it in Bihar.

The BJP-JD(U) speaking one language in Bihar and another in Delhi, he said. The Bihar Assembly recently passed a unanimous resolution against the new format of NPR and NRC.

Singhvi stated categorically, that according to the Congress, NRC is unconstitutional and wrong and should not happen. “It divides the country. If you have courage...And if I am doing something unconstitutional, I am inciting somebody and doing something anti-national, then you should arrest me,” he said.

Slamming Prasad, the Congress said the BJP will not understand the fight to finish. “Across that line are thieves, capitalist friend, rapists and hate and you are promoting it all,” the party said in a tweet.

“Across this line are farmers, labourers, poor, women, youth and the protector of their interests - Congress,” it said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sonia-deputes-5-member-team-to-visit-riot-hit-areas.html
109,29-2-20,"Opp parties write to Prez, ask to ensure peace in Delhi","Leaders from several non-Congress parties like NCP, CPI(M), CPI, RJD, LJD, DMK and AAP have written to President Ram Nath Kovind to direct authorities to ensure peace is restored in violence-hit northeast Delhi and action against those accused of making provocative speeches. They also sought time from Kovind to discuss the situation in the national Capital.

“Immediate establishment of peace and a direction to authorities concerned, like the Lt Governor of Delhi who is directly answerable to you, to ensure speedy restoration of normalcy and to ensure that

FIRs must be filed immediately against all who have made provocative hate speeches and the perpetrators of this violence must be brought to book,” the leaders said in their letter.

The Congress had met the President on Thursday to seek normalcy and peace in areas hit by violence, and had demand Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation.

The leaders from the non-Congress opposition parties also urged the president to direct authorities to set up relief camps for those rendered homeless during the violence, provide them adequate security and ensure supply of essential commodities for their wellbeing.

Since these riots have caused unimaginable mental anguish to the people, especially children, centres must be opened in the affected areas to counsel them, the letter stated. The parties also said they be allowed to organise inter-faith peace events in riot-affected areas

The Centre should announce “suitable compensation to the families of those who died and those who were injured in these attacks”, the letter stated.It said adequate compensation should be given to those whose homes, properties and commercial establishments were destroyed.

The letter was signed by Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s Sitaram Yechury, Loktantrik Janata Dal’s Sharad Yadav, Nationalist Congress Party’s Praful Patel, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s T R Balu, Communist Party of India’s D Raja, Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Manoj Jha and Aam Aadmi Party’s Sanjay Singh.

Sanjay Singh, who is a Rajya Sabha member, asked why the BJP was not taking action against those openly giving inflammatory speeches

“The court has taken the name of Kapil Mishra, Pravesh Verma and Anurag Thakur, then why no action is being taken by the BJP. Is any law and order left in this country. Their own MP Gautam Gambhir is demanding action against them, their allies are asking for action, but they are roaming freely,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/opp-parties-write-to-prez--ask-to-ensure-peace-in-delhi.html
110,29-2-20,"Don’t teach raj dharma, BJP responds to Cong","Charging the Congress with changing its colours on the Citizenship issue, the BJP on Friday asked Congress president Sonia Gandhi not to teach it ‘raj dharma’ and accused the Opposition party of instigating communal violence in northeast Delhi and flouting the Constitution.

Union Law Minister and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad hit out at the Opposition party a day after the Congress leaders, led by Sonia Gandhi, met President Ram Nath Kovind and submitted a memorandum demanding resignation of Union Home Minister Amit Shah for “abdication of duty” during the communal violence in northeast Delhi. She had also reminded the Centre for its ‘rajdharma’ and protecting the people from all faiths in the country.

“Sonia Gandhi don’t preach Rajdharma. see your own face in mirror of your rajdharma,” the law minister asserted adding their record is “full of twists and turns”.

Prasad reminded Congress that its leaders Jawahar Lal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad , Indira and Rajiv Gandhi had openly taken a stand in favour of Indian minorities and cited the example of Indira’s intervention for Indians in Uganda, Rajiv for Tamils and Manmohan Singh favouring Citizenship bill for minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

He said the incumbent Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and then Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi wrote to then Home Minister Shivraj Patil on the citizenship issue. Why are you becoming a turncoat now ? What kind of Rajdharma is it,” Prasad asked.

Prasad wondered why Congress was opposing a legislation which it backed but could not complete the process when it was in the saddle at the centre.

He accused Sonia of provoking the Delhi situation by saying “ Is paar ya us paar, faisla lena hai” at the Ramleela Ground rally in Delhi in last December. Is this not provocation and not “drifting from the Constitution,” he wondered.

Similarly, as against Congress opposition to National Population Register (NPR), he recalled the Manmohan Singh government’s notification on the issue in 2010. Prasad said CAA was passed as per Constitutional provisions but the Congress was now arousing passions on the issue. “Ap karein to theek, hum karein to nahin,” the BJP leader said.

He accused Congress leaders of instigating those in the sit-in protest at Shaheen Bagh against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Rubbishing the Congress President’s demand for union home minister’s resignation, BJP leader said Shah was very proactive from the very first day of the violence to stop it.

Asked about controversial remarks made by the BJP leaders like Kapil Mishra and Pravesh Verma, Prasad said the party doesn’t approve such statements. He said a Special Investigation Team has been formed to “probe all angles” of Delhi violence. On inaction from the police, the law minister said police administration will answer this and responsibility will be fixed.

Prasad again dismissed speculation on Delhi High court judge S Muralidhar’s transfer out of Delhi saying this was decided by the Supreme Court Collegium with the judge’s consent on February 12. There are around a dozen such transfers, he said.

“ This is a government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh , myself, and likes of Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj who fought against Emergency for independence of judiciary and media,” he said while asking Congress leaders not to teach BJP its “rajdharma’.

The Union minister alleged that the Congress could stoop to any level for “vote-bank” politics, adding that it should act responsibly for maintaining peace and harmony in country. “For Congress, the party and the family comes before the country,” he alleged.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/don---t-teach-raj-dharma--bjp-responds-to-cong.html
111,29-2-20,MEA Secy travels to Kabul for US-Taliban deal,"As the US and the Taliban are set to ink a peace deal on Saturday in Qatar, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Friday travelled to Kabul and conveyed India’s unstinted support to a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.

India’s Ambassador to Qatar P Kumaran is slated to attend the ceremony where the US and Taliban will strike the peace deal. It will be for the first time India will officially attend an event involving the Taliban.

The Foreign Secretary held talks with acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Haroon Chakhansuri and apprised him about India’s views on the peace deal as well as its commitment for all-round development of the country.

External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said here on Friday Shringla and Chakhansur reviewed and positively assessed developments in bilateral strategic partnership.

The US and the Taliban are set to sign a peace deal at a ceremony in Doha on Saturday which will provide for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan nearly 18 years after their deployment in the country. “Foreign Secretary conveyed India’s support for the people of Afghanistan in their pursuit for sustainable peace, security and development,” Kumar tweeted.

India has been a key stakeholder in the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan. In a significant move, India had sent two former diplomats in “non-official” capacity to a conference on Afghan peace process in Moscow in November 2018.

The conference organised by Russia was attended by a high-level Taliban delegation, representatives of Afghanistan as well as from several other countries, including the US, Pakistan and China.

Major powers such as the US, Russia and Iran have been reaching out to the Taliban as part of efforts to push the stalled Afghan peace process. India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan controlled.

India has also been maintaining that care should be taken to ensure that any such process does not lead to any “ungoverned spaces” where terrorists and their proxies can relocate.

Ahead of peace deal, India has conveyed to the US that pressure on Pakistan to crack down on terror networks operating from its soil must be kept up though Islamabad’s cooperation for peace in Afghanistan is crucial.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mea-secy-travels-to-kabul-for-us-taliban-deal.html

Kamal Nath was addressing the 125th Annual Conference of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in Indore on Friday on the subject of ‘Business and Beyond’. The

Minister for Home Bala Bachchan, Minister for Public Health and Family Welfare Tulsi Silawat were present on the occasion.

Chief Minister Kamal Nath said that instead of striving for the prosperity today, there is need to work for the progress of poor and backward people of the society at all levels. This will automatically make the country and society strong. He said that along with bringing improvement in government and administration, there is also a need to improve behavior.

Constant changes are taking place in the country and the world. People’s aspirations are also increasing with requirements. It is necessary for the industrial development of Madhya Pradesh that with the changing world, CII should play a role of an industry motivator. Industries and startup entrepreneurs should make their functioning ideal, so that Madhya Pradesh could establish its image as an ideal industrial destination in the country and the world.

Kamal Nath said that rapid changes are taking place in the field of technology. Robotics and artificial intelligence have taken the place of human beings. Keeping this in mind, industrial units have to make new strategy pertaining to their functioning.

The Chief Minister said that Madhya Pradesh is the second state in the country in horticulture sector. There is a vast scope of horticulture in the state. With small efforts, we can make Madhya Pradesh the horticulture capital of the country. For this, processing units at large scale should be set up by the investors to enable us to provide better products in the market. This will benefit both farmers and industrial units.

The Chief Minister said that Madhya Pradesh has all the qualities for becoming a logistic hub. We can develop the state as a dry port. By expanding the air services, we can meet the needs of the industry. The state government is making planned efforts in this direction. CII Madhya Pradesh should also prepare a proposal in this regard, on the basis of which the government can take necessary decisions.

On this occasion, the Chief Minister honoured the persons of industrial fraternity with the CII Awards for their outstanding work in the field of industry.

Patnaik also urged for increasing banking, tele-density and coal royalty in the State.

“Royalty on coal has not been revised from 2012. There is an urgent need to revise royalty on coal and also to share the proceeds of clean energy cess with the State Government,” said he.

He also demanded announcement of a special economic package for speeding up the infrastructural development of the eastern region. “Our regions have some of the largest scheduled areas of the country. I reiterate my demand for inclusion of the Ho, Bhumij and Mundari languages in the Eighth Schedule of Constitution,” he added.

Patnaik said Odisha provides 50-per cent funds and land free of cost in important railway projects, but the projects’ progress has been very slow.

“If a nationwide analysis is done for tele-density, banking density, rail and road density, East Zone would be at the bottom in all these subjects that are in the Union List. There is a need to double the allotments made to this region so that they catch up to the national benchmarks,” said Patnaik.

118,29-2-20,Pulwama attack breakthrough: JeM’s Bashir in NIA net,"A year after the Pulwama terror attack, the NIA on Friday claimed to have achieved a major breakthrough in the case by arresting an accused Shakir Bashir Magrey, an Over-Ground Worker of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).

Magrey, 22, is a resident of Hajibal, Kakapora, Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir.

“A furniture shop owner, Shakir Bashir Magrey provided shelter and other logistical assistance to the Pulwama suicide-bomber Adil Ahmad Dar. He was introduced to Adil Ahmad Dar in mid-2018 by a Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Umar Farooq and he became a full-time OGW of JeM,” the NIA said in a statement.

During his initial interrogation, Magrey has disclosed that on several occasions, he collected and delivered arms, ammunition, cash and explosive material to the JeM terrorists including those involved in the Pulwama attack, the agency said.

Magrey has further revealed that he had harboured Adil Ahmad Dar and Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Umar Farooq in his house from late 2018 till the attack in February 2019 and assisted them in the preparation of the IED, the NIA said. His shop is located near Lethpora bridge, and as advised by Mohammad Umar, he started conducting reconnaissance of the movement of CRPF convoy on Jammu-Srinagar Highway in January 2019, and informed Mohammad Umar and Adil Ahmad Dar about it. Further, he was also involved in modifying the Maruti Eeco car and fitting the IED early in February, 2019.

The Pulwama attack was carried out on February 14 last year by JeM taking a toll of 40 CRPF personnel.

During investigation, the make, model and number of the car used in the attack was ascertained by the NIA to be a Maruti Eeco car through forensic examination of the tiny remnants of the car, which were seized from the spot during extended searches.

The details of the car used for the suicide bombing corroborated by Magrey. The explosives used in the attack were determined to be Ammonium Nitrate, Nitro-Glycerin and RDX through forensic investigation, the agency said.

Investigation has also confirmed the identity of the suicide bomber to be Adil Ahmad Dar through DNA matching with that of his father. Other key terrorists involved in the attack have been found to be Muddasir Ahmad Khan (JeM’s Divisional Commander of South Kashmir killed in an operation by security forces on March 11, 2019), Pakistani terrorists Muhammad Umar Farooq and IED expert Kamran, (both killed on March 29, 2019), the owner of the car Sajjad Ahmad Bhat, resident of Marhama, Anantnag (killed on June 16, 2019) and Qari Yassir, JeM’s Commander for Kashmir (killed on January 25, 2020).

Magrey was produced before the NIA Special Court at Jammu on Friday and remanded to 15-day NIA custody for his detailed interrogation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pulwama-attack-breakthrough--jem---s-bashir-in-nia-net.html
119,29-2-20,LoP issue rocks Assembly on Day 1,"Slogans like ‘Jai Sri Ram’, ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ were raised in the Jharkhand Assembly on Friday with the BJP legislators demanding Speaker Rabindra Nath Mahto to accord leader of opposition (LoP) status to Babulal Marnadi the BJP legislative party leader in House.

As the month long budget session commenced on Friday at new Assembly building, BJP legislator from Bokaro Viranchi Narayan raised the issue demanding the Speaker to accord LoP chair to Marandi. The Speaker replying to MLA said that the House has taken cognizance to MLAs’ demand and will give its reply, however the MLAs were adamant on their demand. The BJP MLAs trooped into the well of the House demanding Speaker to announce BJP legislative party leader Marandi as Leader of Opposition.

The BJP MLAs with their demand entered the well of the house sitting on the floor with their demand. As the Speaker was undeterred with BJP legislators’ demand, the BJP MLA sitting on the floor raised the slogan of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’. However, the Speaker said that it is not the appropriate time to such demand.

Few Congress MLAs such Irfan Ansari, Deepika Pandey Singh and others too reached the well of the House opposing BJP lawmakers move.

Marandi was seen sitting in the front row adjacent to AJSU party Chief Sudesh Mahto, which was allotted to him during a special session between January 6 and January 8 soon after the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a thumping majority in the Assembly polls in November-December.

The BJP legislators, on request of Speaker, later occupied their chairs with Speaker saying that on the first day of House condolences messages is to be read. The demand for according leader of opposition chair to Marandi was again raised when speaker asked leaders from different political parties to read the condolence messages. Senior BJP leader CP Singh who was asked by Speaker to read the condolence message after Chief Minister Hemant Soren said that as a practice the condolence message is read by leader of the opposition party in the house and as per rule our leader is Babulal Marandi. The Speaker after condolence message adjourned the House till Monday.

Meanwhile, outside the House Marandi said, “I am BJP legislative party leader and will discharge my duties even if I get ground to sit. The BJP will keep on raising public interest issue in the House.”

Congress MLA and Minister Banna Gupta said that the BJP MLAs were unnecessary raising the issue. Gupta said, “Speaker had said that issue will sorted out as per law, but the BJP wants the issue to be sorted out immediately. They should understand that in last Assembly session, Speaker Dinesh Oraon took almost five year to take a final decision on membership of six JVM MLAs who switched side from JVM to BJP.”

BJP MLAs on February 24 unanimously elected Marandi as their Legislature Party Leader after he merged his Jharkhand Vikas Party (Prajatantrik-JVM-P) with the saffron party a week ago in the presence of former BJP president and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

A BJP legislature party delegation had also given a letter to the office of the Speaker in favour of Marandi on February 17, when he had merged his party.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lop-issue-rocks-assembly-on-day-1.html

The full compensation amount will be provided after 2-3 days,” Kejriwal said.

While death toll has recorded 42 till Friday, the Delhi Government has set up shelters for riot victims where they can stay. A total 18 Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDMs) also have been appointed in the riot affected areas to maintain law and order situation. Beside this, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal also visited the affected area in the areas.

According to the Delhi Government officials, an app along with the physical system will be developed where citizens can lodge details of the loss of property, loss of vehicles, damage to the business and details of injury and death.

121,29-2-20,5% quota for Muslims soon: Nawab Malik,"Reviving the DF Government’s stalled move of 2014, Maharashtra Minorities Affairs Minister Nawab Malik on Friday announced that the State Government would soon come out with a legislation according 5 per cent reservations to Muslims in educational institutions in the state.

Replying to a question raised by Congress member in the Maharashtra Letgislative Council, Malik said: “At that time, the Bombay High Court had given a go-ahead for 5 per cent reservations to Muslims in educations but the previous BJP-led Government did not take any action on the HC directive. That being the case, we will soon come out with a law in this regard as soon as possible”.

Opposing Malik’s announcement, senior BJP MLC Vijay Girkar said that reservations could be given on the basis of religion as per the Constitution.

Seeking to quell the speculation that the Sena might oppose reservations to Muslims in educational institutions as it had done in the past when it was in alliance with the BJP, Mailk said: “Everyone was looking at Shiv Sena in the house, after I made this announcement. Let me assure you all that we have the Shiv Sena’s support. The Sena has assured us that all social problems faced by backward classes, castes and communities will be resolved. Like others, Muslims will be given justice. The Sena may have opposed the move when it was in alliance with the BJP, but it with us and is supporting the reservations to Muslims in educational institutions”.

It may be recalled that on November 14, 2014, the Bombay High Court had stayed an ordinance promulgated by the then Congress-led DF government ahead of the State Assembly polls extending 16 per cent reservations to Marathas and five per cent to Muslims, saying that they were not in conformity with the law laid down by the Supreme Court in three cases.

However, a HC bench, headed by Chief Justice Mohit Shah, had allowed reservations to Muslims in educational institutions, on the ground at that their educational achievements were ""abysmally low"" and that there was a need to draw them into the ""mainstream of secular education"". The court had ruled that admissions given to Muslims on the basis of such reservations this year would not be disturbed and students would be allowed to continue their courses.

With the ordinance promulgated by the DF Government having lapsed, Muslims no longer enjoy any reservations in the State.

On its part, the previous BJP-led government – without bothering to follow up on the nod for reservations to Muslims in educational institutions – in November 2018 announced 16 per cent reservations for Marathas in educational institutions and government jobs. However, the state government’s decision was subsequently challenged in the Bombay High Court.

On June 27, 2019, the Bombay High Court on Thursday upheld the previous government’s decision to accord reservations to the Maratha community, but directed the Devendra Fadnavis dispensation to bring down the quantum of the approved reservation from 16 per cent to 12 per cent in educational institutions and 13 per cent in government jobs.

After upholding the “legislative competence” of the State government to create a separate category of the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) and grant reservation, a HC bench of Justices Ranjit More and Bharati Dangre noted that 16 per cent of reservations as approved by the government “is not justifiable”.

However, the HC bench ordered the state government to bring down the reservation for Marathas from 16 per cent to 12 per cent in educational institutions and to 13 per cent in Government jobs.

""We hold and declare that the State Government possesses legislative competence to create a separate category of the Socially and Educationally Backward Class and grant reservation,"" the Judges said.

“We hold and declare that the report of the Gaikwad Commission has set out the exceptional circumstances and extra-ordinary situations justifying crossing of the limit of 50% reservation as set out in Indra Sawhney's case, “ the judges noted.

Ater taking into account the June 7, 2019 high court order, Maharashtra currently has 65 per cent reservations in jobs and 64 per cent reservations in educational institutions. If the state government accords five per cent reservations in educational institutions, the reservations in educational institutions will go up to 69, far above the 50 per cent reservations prescribed by the Supreme Court.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/5--quota-for-muslims-soon--nawab-malik.html
122,29-2-20,"5% quota for Muslims soon: Nawab Malik Where was powerful HM when Delhi was burning, asks Sena","In its stinging criticism of Amit Shah, the Shiv Sena on Friday demanded to know as to where was the “powerful” Union Home Minister when Delhi was burning, what was he doing and why was he not seen in the national Capital.

“When Delhi erupted and was burning, where was Union Home Minister? What was he was he doing? These questions are being asked. The Delhi riots have so far claimed 38 lives and there has enormous loss to public property. Had there been a Congress or any alliance government at the Centre, the Opposition BJP would have demanded the resignation of Union Home Minister,” the Sena’s official mouth-piece stated.

In an editorial published in “Saamana”, the Shiv Sena said that had it been in the Opposition, the BJP would have indulged in all protests, including organising a morcha or a gherao to demand the Union Home Minister. “But this cannot happen now. Because, the BJP is in power and the Opposition is weak. Still, Sonia Gandhi has demanded the resignation of Amit Shah,” the Saamana editorial said.

Coming down heavily for Shah's absence during the early days of riots in the national capital, the “Saamana” editorial stated: “It is surprising that the country's powerful Home Minister was nowhere to be seen in Delhi during the riots. Not long ago when the Delhi Assembly polls were held, he was seen going door to door distributing pamphlets and he spared so much of his time for campaigning.

Questioning the Centre’s delay in responding to riots in Delhi, the editorial said: “When the Home Minister was in Ahmedabad (on February 24) welcoming visiting US President Donald Trump, an IB staffer was murdered in Delhi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed for peace after three full days and NSA Ajit Doval was on the streets of Delhi talking to people. What is the use now of these measures after the damage has been done?"", Saamana wondered.

“The Opposition in Parliament is bound question Shah as to where he when Delhi witnessed a spiral of violence and was burning. In such an event, will the ruling BJP dub all those who questions on this issue as anti-nationals?,” the Sena asked.

Slamming the Centre for the manner in which it transferred the Delhi high court judge S. Muralidhar hours after he said that ""another 1984-like situation cannot be allowed to happen in the city under its watch"" and indicted the Delhi Police for inaction during the recent riots, the “Saamana” editorial said: “Within 24 hours after Judge Murlidhar flagged the riots issue and said that time has come for provide Z security to ordinary citizens, order was issued from Rashtrapati Bhavan transferring him. After the Judge passed strictures against the Centre and the state government, truth itself became causality”.

“The high court ordered registration of cases against Union Minister of State

Anurag Thakur, BJP MP Parveszh Varma and party leader Kapil Mishra. The Government punished the Judge who issued an order against these three leaders,” the editorial said.

“Is punishment being meted out for speaking truth in court? What was wrong thing that Justice Murlidhar said? What all he said was truth,” the Sena said.

In its severe castigation of the BJP for the manner in which it was practising nationalism in the country, the Sena said: “Insanity and bigotry displayed by in the practitioners of nationalism have pushed the country three hundred years backwards. Hate speeches have become investment for the ruling BJP. The economy has collapsed. But the ruling party is marketing its hate speeches in full swing”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/5--quota-for-muslims-soon--nawab-malik-where-was-powerful-hm-when-delhi-was-burning--asks-sena.html
123,29-2-20,IMD: Summer likely to be warmer than normal,"After a cold winter, summer is likely to be more warmer than normal over northwest, west, central and parts of south India in 2020.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday predicted the average maximum temperature is likely to be higher than normal by 1 degree Celsius plus in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Rajasthan and Arunachal Pradesh during March, April and May. According to IMD, Jammu &Kashmir, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi might witness the summer warmer by about 0.5-1 degree Celsius.

In its summer forecast, the IMD predicted that normal temperature is likely to be 0.5-1 degree Celsius higher in the core heat wave (HW) zone during the season (March, April, May). In the remaining meteorological subdivisions, the average temperature is expected to be near normal in the summer months (March to May).

Day temperatures are likely to be above normal by 0.5 degree Celsius over Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir, Haryana, Chandigarh, western Uttar Pradesh, eastern Rajasthan, parts of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, the Saurashtra and Kutch regions of Gujarat, Konkan and Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, Marathawada, Vidharbha, north interior and coastal Karnataka, and Kerala. The rest of the country is likely to experience near-normal maximum temperatures (between -0.5 degree Celsius and 0.5 degree Celsius).

The average minimum temperature is also expected to rise in these regions.

Regarding monsoons, there is good news: El Niño (a climate cycle in the Pacific Ocean with a global impact on weather patterns) is expected to be neutral in the March-May period, which precedes the rains. But a clearer picture on it is expected to come around April, when the IMD releases its official first monsoon forecast.

The southwest monsoon in 2019 (June to September) delivered 10 per cent above-average rainfall in the country, the highest in 25 years. In 1994, the rainfall was 110 per cent during the June-September period. Before that, more than 10 per cent above average rainfall was witnessed in 1990 (119 per cent). The excess rainfall last year not only flooded several cities and towns, but also caused damage to standing kharif crop in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh (its eastern part).",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/imd--summer-likely-to-be-warmer-than-normal.html
124,29-2-20,TN: 8 animals electrocuted,"Cherambadi Forest Range in Tamil Nadu’s Gudalur has turned out to be a graveyard for wild animals as an elephant, four wild boars, two mongooses and a cobra died after being electrocuted when they came into contact with a live wire deep inside the forests. The high tension wires were installed by the State owned Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Company (TANGEDCO) to distribute power to tea estates in the region.

“It is a sad and shocking incident. The eight-year old tusker came into cotact with the stay wire and electrocuted. Other animals could have come to feed on the carcass of the pachyderm and died,” said G Ramakrishnan, Range Forest Officer, Gudalur. He said the department authorities were in the dark about the exact time and date on which the mishap occurred. “We came across the dead bodies of the animals by Wednesday and sent the same for post mortem,” said Ramakrishnan.

Forest officials in Gudalur led by Ramakrishnan were working overtime to turn back a mother elephant from the carcass of her month old calf in the Gudalur Forests. The calf wule grazing with its mother and other members opf the herd had accidentally fallen into a swamp and died.

The mother elephant and her friends stood guard to the carcass for four days and scared away the forest officials who tried to remove the body of the calf from the swamp.

“We succeeded in dispersing the elephant herd including the mother from the spot. Our main concern was the possibilities of the elephants developing infection from the carcass. It was after the elephants returned to the forests we were alerted about the electrocution,” said Ramakrishnan.

Cherambadi was in the news last year when many elephants had come out of the reserve forests when they faced acute shortage of drinking water and food.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tn--8-animals-electrocuted.html
125,29-2-20,Maha MLAs want all-party team to meet PM,"Maharashtra Assembly speaker Nana Patole on Friday directed the State Government to take an all- party delegation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demand caste-wise Census in 2021.

After the Speaker’s direction, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar told the House he would discuss the issue with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and take a decision.

Members cutting across party lines demanded that an all-party delegation call on the Prime Minister to seek caste- wise Census to determine the population of other backward classes (OBCs).

OBC Welfare Minister Vijay Wadettiwar and Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad demanded that the state conduct its own caste-based Census to know the dataon OBCs so thatsteps can be taken for their welfare.

Food and Civil Supplies Minister Chhagan Bhujbal said after Maharashtra, the Bihar assembly has also passed a resolution demanding caste-based Census in 2021.

""There are 350 sub-castes among OBCs whose proportion in the total population stands at 54 per cent. India had caste Census till 1931.

""Pranab Mukherjee (then a minister in the UPA government) had agreed to the demand (for caste-based count) in 2004which was supported by Narendra Modi as Gujarat Chief Minister.

""But the OBC count was done by the rural development department and not the Census commissioner. The data was faulty and hence it was not released,"" Bhujbal said.

Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP suggested that all-party delegation meet Modi seeking his intervention. The office of Registrar General and Census Commissioner, India, is an autonomousbody, the former chief minister said.

Patole directed the state government to take an all- party delegation to Modi and said this should be done before the decennial exercise begins.

There is no politics in this demand as there is a need for data for upliftment of the poor among the OBCs, said Bhujbal.

Patole said the state government can examine if a separateCensus can be undertaken by Maharashtra like Tamil Nadu.

The state Assembly on January 8 passed a unanimous resolutionurging to the Centre to hold caste-based Census in 2021.

In this backdrop, the legislature received a letter from the office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner on February 17. According to the letter, which was read out by Patole, the total number of OBCs in the country is nearly 6,285and this includes sub-castes, sub-groups whereas the corresponding number of OBCs as per list of states and Union Territories is 7,200.

In case a question on OBCs is canvassed, it will return names of hundreds and thousands of castes, sub-castes as the people use their clan/gotra, sub caste and caste names interchangeably. The phonetic similaritiesin name of the castes often lead to misclassification, the letter said.

It said collection of data of OBCs/SEBCs and other castes will adversely affect the integrity of Census exercise and hence the enumeration of OBCs, SEBCs and other castes has not been taken up in 2021 Census.

However, members in the assembly opined the matter should be pursued with the Centre. The issue came up in the house after the Question Hour when Vikas Thakare (Congress) sought to knowaction on the unanimous resolution passed by the assembly on January 8.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/maha-mlas-want-all-party-team-to-meet-pm.html
126,29-2-20,UP Opp seeks passage of Assembly resolution,"The Uttar Pradesh Opposition parties on Friday rooted in the State Assembly for passing a resolution for a caste-based census in 2021 on the lines of one passed by the Bihar legislature.

The BSP, Congress and Samajwadi Party leaders raised the demand for passing a resolution to this effect during the Zero Hour of the House, arguing that a caste-based census would lead to better implementation of various developmental schemes.

Ram Govind Chaudhary (Samajwadi Party) raised the demand for the caste-based census arguing that backward lasses people were being denied their rights for which it was required that the forms that need to be filled for the census should carry a proper column for people's caste.

BSP's Lalji Verma and Aradhana Misra of the Congress too raised similar demand. With the Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna expressing the government's inability in this regard, pointed out that it was not a state issue.

At this, Chaudhary cited the cases when similar moves had been made by the state assembly in the past during Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav-led SP governments.

Chaudhary recalled when the Backward Caste Commission was constituted , the then prime Minister had made a promise in this regard and asked what the problem was in doing so.

He also made a mention of the Bihar Assembly passing a similar resolution in this regard. When Speaker Hridya Narain Dikshit refused to allow them to speak, the SP members staged a walkout raising anti-government slogans.

128,29-2-20,"Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs unite to keep rioters at bay","Giving a message of unity in communal violence that hit Northeast Delhi, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh residents of a Yamuna Vihar’s B Block colony in the area came together and stood guard against frenzied mobs which ran riot in nearby areas vandalising homes, shops and torching cars. The B-Block colony in Yamuna Vihar has a Hindu-dominated Bahjanpura on one side and Muslim populated Ghonda on the other.

The residents have not let their guard down even as the situation is limping back to normalcy following four days of violence that has claimed at least 42 lives and left over 200 injured. Businessmen, doctors and people working at government offices stuck together as violence reached its crest on Monday and Tuesday, and have been guarding the locality round the clock.

Earlier, the locals had claimed inadequate police deployment in the area, but were satisfied as patrolling by security personnel increased in the last two days.

Charanjeet Singh, a Sikh who owns a transport firm, said residents have ensured that not too many people gather to guard the colony at night. “It has been decided not use sticks or rods, an idea which seems to have worked in maintaining peace,” he said. “People from all faiths in the locality sit outside their homes at night and deal with any suspected outsider,” said a 30 year-old Arib who is a dentist by profession and a resident of the area.

“It is the sloganeering by mobs that causes panic in the dead of night. Such slogans are from both sides and we hear groups of people moving forward towards our area. This is where we let the Muslim locals deal with Muslim groups and Hindu residents deal with Hindu groups coming from outside,” said Arib.

Faisal, a businessman in his 30s, said after two days of major violence, there was palpable tension in the area. “Nobody could sleep in the neighbourhood even on Wednesday and Thursday when the situation was brought under control,” he said.

Faisal said around 4 am on Wednesday, three to four miscreants had torched a car, but were chased away by vigilant residents. “The residents raised an alarm and others also gathered, saving other vehicles parked nearby from being damaged,” he added.

On the idea of not keeping sticks while guarding B-Block, Singh said, “Violence begets violence, crowd begets crowd. We thought if somebody would see sticks or rods in our hands from a distance and large crowds standing guard, it is likely they would want to come prepared. This could fuel violence.”

“Now, if there is some young man returning late in the night, we identify if he belongs to our area. If not, we normally inform him about the situation and guide him to his destination, if required,” he added.

Seventy-year-old V K Sharma said people in his colony never had any trouble with each other, as he blamed “outside elements” for the violence in north east Delhi.

“Some people have some problem with symbols. If they find a particular religion’s symbol on a shop, home or a car, they vandalise it. This is on both sides, Hindus as well as Muslims. But not all people in all religion are like that. There are good people who outnumber these handful people involved in violence,” he said.

The violence happened for two days but it would take months for fear to subside, Sharma said, as he took out his two granddaughters, aged nine and two, out for ice cream. “I cannot reduce the tension outside my home, but at least I can make these kids feel good by reducing their craving for ice cream,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hindus--muslims--sikhs-unite-to-keep-rioters-at-bay.html

134,29-2-20,Sedition case: City Govt permits prosecution of Kanhaiya,"The Delhi Government has permitted the prosecution of Left leader Kanhaiya Kumar over a long-pending sedition case that alleges the former Jawaharlal Nehru University student led a procession that chanted “anti-national” slogans during an on-campus event in February 2016.

Permission was given after Delhi Police wrote to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s government last week requesting it to expedite the process. That letter came hours after a court directed cops to send a reminder to the ruling AAP. The application had been pending since January 14, 2019.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari welcomed the decision and also took a swipe at Mr Kejriwal.

“Probably keeping current political situation in mind, Chief Minister Kejriwal has finally given sanction prosecute Kanhaiya Kumar. We welcome the decision. We have been demanding (this)... let the law take its own course,” Tiwari said.

Manoj Tiwari led the BJP’s unsuccessful attempt to unseat the AAP in Delhi Assembly election on the back of a vitriolic campaign that called anti-citizenship law protesters “anti-national” and accused the party of shielding the likes of “Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid, and other anti-India forces’’.

A 1,200-page chargesheet, filed over a year ago, names Kanhaiya Kumar and nine others, including two more former JNU students in Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya.

It alleges they led a procession on the anniversary of the hanging of Parliament attack mastermind Azfal Guru and supported the chanting of seditious slogans during the event.

However, the court refused the chargesheet, asking police to take requisite sanction before going ahead. At that time the court directed the cops to get sanction by February 6, 2019.

On failure to do so, the court observed: “Authorities can’t sit on file for indefinite period”. The request for sanction has been pending since.

After the court’s reminder last week Chief Minister Kejriwal said he would ask the state home department, headed by AAP’s Satyender Jain, for an early decision in the matter.

A chargesheet in a sedition case requires permission from the state government.

In this case, the Delhi Police reports to the Union Home Ministry in the BJP-led government at the centre, which is a fierce critic of the AAP that is in power in the national capital.

Both Kanhaiya Kumar and Umar Khalid have said the case is “politically motivated”.

“When the magisterial inquiry was done, it was concluded that no JNU student was involved. I want to say, the police filed a chargesheet after three years. We thank them,” Kumar, who is currently at an event in Jharkhand’s Ranchi, told NDTV earlier.

“The filing of chargesheet after three years, ahead of elections, clearly shows it to be politically motivated. I trust the judiciary of my country,” he told news agency ANI.

Kanhaiya Kumar, who has emerged as a fierce critic of the ruling BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, made his electoral debut in last year’s Lok Sabha election. He contested from Bihar’s Begusarai seat on a Communist Party of India (CPI) ticket but lost to the BJP’s Giriraj Singh by over 4 lakh votes.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sedition-case--city-govt-permits-prosecution-of-kanhaiya.html

136,29-2-20,AGR woes: No decision on relief to telcos at DCC meet,"The crucial meeting of Digital Communications Commission (DCC) on Friday could not arrive at a decision on relief to the distressed telecom sector as government officials said more details are required for reconciliation of data on statutory dues.

In a day of hectic parleys at DoT, Vodafone Idea (VIL) CEO and MD Ravinder Takkar also met Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash but refused to comment on the details of his discussion.

Telecom companies have been desparately waiting for a bailout package from the government after a Supreme Court order put their statutory liabilities at Rs 1.47 lakh crore, and all eyes were on the DCC meet for the much-needed breather to fix the AGR imbroglio.

In fact, just days ahead of the Friday meeting of DCC, Vodafone Idea — which is the most vulnerable of the lot — told the government that it would not be able to pay the Supreme Court mandated Rs 53,000 crore dues unless state support is extended to survive the crisis.

VIL had made a strong plea for setting off Rs 8,000 crore of GST credits, a three-year moratorium on payment of the remaining amount which should be staggered over 15 years at a simple interest rate of 6 per cent, drastic cut in licence fee and fixing of a minimum price of calls and data.

While telecom department officials insisted that DCC meeting on Friday did not focus on AGR issues but rather on project implementation for PPP on Bharat Net project, a source present at the meeting said no decision on telecom relief was taken at the meeting although discussion did take place.

DCC, the highest decision-making body of the government on telecom, discussed the issue and looked at options at the meeting which lasted two hours. Further discussions are needed, and the DCC is likely to meet again in the coming days but no date has been fixed for the next meeting, they said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/agr-woes--no-decision-on-relief-to-telcos-at-dcc-meet.html

Speaking at CNBC TV 18’s business leadership awards event, Sitharaman made it clear that she was not expecting a jump in the number either.

India’s economic growth slowed to 4.7 per cent in October-December 2019, according to official data released on Friday.

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth was registered at 5.6 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 2018-19, as per the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO).

On the impact of coronavirus on the economy, she said there is no need to immediately press the “panic button”, but admitted that it may get challenging if the issues prolong for another two or three weeks, citing her conversations with the industry players over the last few days.

She also said the pharmaceutical and electronic industries, which depend heavily on imports from China for raw materials, have suggested airlifting of essential items and the government may consider the same.

However, the logistics of the same, like aggregating the goods and getting them to a single place will have to be done by the industry itself, she said, promising help from the government through the consular staff.

Sitharaman said the government is “pushing the banks like never before” to lend as much as possible across all categories, including retail, home and agriculture segments.

She, however, said that the government wants to learn from the experiences of the 2008-09 and ensure that there are no non-performing assets piled up for later years.

Sitharaman said the government is working creating a development finance institution (DFI), as were bodies like ICICI and IDBI before they turned into full-fledged banks.

The minister said that the ministry has managed to do whatever it can for the economy within the space offered by keeping the fiscal deficit under check and also added that it is not “closing options” on the same.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fm-says----steadiness----in-economy-is-a-good-sign-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fm-says----steadiness----in-economy-is-a-good-sign.html

While S Kathavarayan, representing the Gudiyatham(SC) constituency breathed his last early Friday, KPP Samy, former Fisheries Minister and the sitting MLA from Thiruvottiyur passed away on Thursday.

The death of these two legislators has brought down the strength of the DMK to 96 from 98. The DMK had wrested the Gudiyatham from the AIADMK in the by election held in May 2019 following the disqualification of Jayanthi Padmanabhan, who switched over to the AMMK launched by TTV Dhinakaran.

This is the first by election to be held in Tamil Nadu since the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Act by the parliament.

144,29-2-20,Bengal Opp levels duplicity charges on Didi,"Even as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday appealed to Home Minister Amit Shah to bring back peace and normalcy to Delhi’s riot-hit areas, Bengal Opposition parties questioned her “deafening silence” over the BJP’s role in fanning the Capital riots.

Congress Lok Sabha leader Adhir Chowdhury who on Friday evening led a torch rally in Kolkata slammed Mamata for her alleged “duplicity in reacting to the situation in the national Capital.”

He said “when Congress and all other parties were demanding the resignation of Amit Shah — who controls all the central forces head-quartered in the Capital — for his complicity in letting the riots to burn Delhi our Chief Minister maintained a deafening silence… Not only this, she even went to Bhubaneshwar to hobnob with a person whose hands are soaked in blood. This duplicity must be condemned in strongest possible terms.”

On whether the BJP was trying a Gujarat model in Delhi Chowdhury said “they are trying a more ferocious Gujarat model in whole of the country which is why we want this Government to go immediately or if they are allowed to stay in power then they will break the country along religious lines.”

Banerjee earlier said that she had appealed to Shah to do take all possible steps to restore normalcy in Delhi at the earliest. “I have told him about how concerned and disturbed we are over situation in Delhi where many people have been killed and many have been injured and properties worth crores have been destroyed,” Banerjee said.

Reacting to her alleged concern over Delhi riots Bengal BJP president said the “Chief Minister should oil her own machine instead of looking at what is happening in Delhi… Her own state is in turmoil. In Bengal there is no democracy. The political opponents are murdered, their women are raped and their houses are burnt by the Trinamool Congress goons. Let her handle this anomaly before pointing fingers at Delhi.”

Attacking the Chief Minister for sharing dialogue table with Shah and allowing him to hold a rally in Kolkata on Sunday, CPI(M) central committee member Sujan Chakrabarty said that “from her latest actions the people of Bengal should assess the true character of Mamata Banerjee.”

He said “here is a Chief Minister who champions the minority cause and who walks miles against Citizenship Amendment Act in order to garner minority votes but refuses to utter a single word against the Home Minister whose party perpetrated the violence in Delhi and who allowed the minorities to be massacred there.

She should have felt ashamed of sitting with this person in Bhubaneshwar.”

The Left Legislature Party leader also condemned the State Government for giving permission to BJP for holding a rally at Sahid Minar in Kolkata on Sunday.

“The rally will be addressed by Amit Shah and everyone knows what his intentions are

in Bengal and what his role was in handling the Delhi riots. Still Mamata Banerjee gave him permission to address a rally in Kolkata,” Chakrabarty said reminding “such is the trust between Mamata Banerjee and the BJP that Amit Shah the his first meeting post Delhi riots will not be held in Assam where his own Government rules but it will be held in

145,29-2-20,COVID-19: NPPA calls for close watch on API availability,"Amid the coronavirus outbreak, drug price regulator NPPA has asked States and Union Territories to keep a close watch on the availability of key raw materials which are imported from China and used in the production of all kinds of medicines.

In a letter addressed to the chief secretaries of states and Union Territories, National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) Chairman Shubhra Singh asked the state officials to keep a close tab on the situation in order to prevent hoarding of such items. “The key drug industry associations have assured the government that there is enough stock of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs)/formulations in the country,” Singh said in the letter.

“However, as a measure of public health preparedness in respect of APIs/ Intermediates/ KSMs which are imported from China, it is requested that State Governments and UTs may closely monitor the production and availability of APIs and their formulations to prevent black marketing and hoarding,” the letter said.

The NPPA chief also asked the officials to ensure compliance of provisions under the Drug Price Control Order (DPCO), 2013.

“It may also be ensured that there is no violation of provisions of DPCO, 2013 with regard to compliance of ceiling prices/permissible increase in prices of scheduled/non-scheduled formulations,” Singh noted. In case any contravention is noticed, necessary action should be taken under the provisions of DPCO, 2013 to ensure availability of life saving essential drugs to the consumers at all times under intimation to this office, she added.

India heavily depends on China for import of key APIs and key starting materials (KSMs), and there is an apprehension that in the wake of COVID-19, the supplies from China might be disrupted, resulting in shortage of medicines in the country.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/covid-19--nppa-calls-for-close-watch-on-api-availability.html

147,29-2-20,HMEL’s credit metrics to worsen due to weak refining margins: Fitch Ratings,"Fitch Ratings on Friday said HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited’s credit metrics over 2019-20 and 2020-21 financial years would worsen by more than previously expected due to near-term weakness in refining margins and a faster pace of its petrochemical (petchem) capex.

Earlier this week, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the corporate family rating of HMEL to Ba2 from Ba1 due to weak refining margins arising from a slump in fuel demand.

In a statement, Fitch Ratings said while credit metrics will worsen in the current and the next financial year, “an accelerated earnings contribution from petchem will lead to faster deleveraging, resulting in net leverage (as defined by adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR) coming down to below 5-times by FY23.”

The net leverage is still within Fitch’s negative rating sensitivities for HMEL’s Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) of ‘bb-’.

HMEL expects to start commercial operations of its petchem project by April 2021, a year ahead of its previous expectation. It spent Rs 3,800 crore during the first nine months of current fiscal and is likely to top Rs 6,000 crore for the financial year, compared with Fitch’s previous expectations of Rs 3,500 crore.

The company, which operates an 11.3 million tonnes a year oil refinery at Bhatinda in Punjab, is in the process of setting up a dual-feed petrochemical capacity of 1.2 million metrics tons per annum (mtpa).

The project, which commenced in October 2017, was originally planned to be completed by March 2022. However, the company now intends to complete it by April 2021.

The firm, which is an equal joint venture of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and steel czar Lakshmi N Mittal’s Mittal Energy Investments, expects FY22 to be the first full year of petchem operations, with an EBITDA contribution of around USD 400-500 million.

“However, we have assumed that it takes longer for the petchem project to stabilise and turn profitable, contributing around USD 115 million of EBITDA in FY22,” it said.

Fitch expects net leverage to peak at around 7x over FY20-FY21, before improving to below 5x in FY22 and below 4x in FY23.

The leverage spike in FY21 is also affected by a one-off 60-day shutdown period for major maintenance of the refinery and integration of the petchem operations.

“We had earlier expected leverage to range around 6x during FY20-FY21 and fall to around 5x by FY23,” it said.

HMEL reported EBITDA of Rs 2,600 crore during April-December 2019, with a gross refining margin (GRM) of USD 9.6 per barrel versus USD 10.3 in FY19.

The reduction was in line with the industry due to strong new supply from China, volatility in crude prices leading to inventory losses, and falling heavy-fuel oil cracks in light of the tougher marine fuel regulations by the International Maritime Organization IMO from January 2020.

Fitch said it has revised down its industry-wide GRM expectations, given the continuing surplus in the refining markets and also weaker-than-expected diesel spreads.

The refining margins are also likely to be weighed down by the coronavirus situation in the near term but refining margins are expected to improve over the medium term, benefitting from strong diesel spreads driven by the IMO regulations, it said.

“Sustained volatility in GRMs, lower earnings from the petchem project, or weaker demand for petroleum products if COVID-19 prevails for a prolonged period would be credit negative.

“Any delays or challenges in the integration of HMEL’s petchem project could also have an impact on deleveraging and add downward pressure to HMEL’s SCP, which has little headroom at ‘bb-’,” Fitch added.

148,29-2-20,Fiscal deficit touches 128.5% of Budget estimate at Jan-end,"India’s fiscal deficit touched 128.5 per cent of the whole year budget target at January-end, said the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) on Friday.

The deficit during the same period during 2018-19 was 121.5 per cent of that year’s Revised Budget Estimate (RE). In actual terms, the fiscal deficit or gap between the expenditure and revenue stood at Rs 9,85,472 crore. The government had targeted to restrict the fiscal deficit at Rs 7,66,846 crore during the year ending March 31, 2020.

While presenting the Union Budget to Parliament earlier this month, Finance Minister Nirmalal Sitharaman had raised fiscal deficit target to 3.8 per cent of the GDP from 3.3 per cent pegged earlier for 2019-20 due to revenue shortage.

As per the CGA data on monthly accounts, revenue receipts during April-January were at Rs 12.5 lakh crore or 67.6 per cent of the RE for 2019-20. This compares with 68.3 per cent of the RE in the previous fiscal.

Total receipts were at 66.4 per cent of RE as against 67.5 per cent in the year-ago period.

The CGA further said that total expenditure at January-end was Rs 22.68 lakh crore or 84.1 per cent of RE, higher than 81.5 per cent in the corresponding period of the last fiscal.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fiscal-deficit-touches-128-5--of-budget-estimate-at-jan-end.html

150,29-2-20,RIL picks 37.7% stake in Alok Industries,"Reliance Industries (RIL) said on Saturday that it has acquired 37.7 per cent stake in the debt-ridden Alok Industries Ltd for Rs 250 crore.

This comes after the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had last year approved its joint acquisition proposal with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co Ltd.

State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar had earlier said the bank expects to recover Rs 1,700 crore from Alok Industries.

151,29-2-20,Living heritage,"The Pioneer group is expanding its umbrella of connecting with thinking minds through live talks. Called The Pioneer Agenda series, we hope to generate awareness on ideas that will shape India in 2030 and could be a template for policy-making. The first such dialogue, Exotica Tourism Summit, Exotica being the group's travel and wellness magazine, was held at Shangri-La hotel, New Delhi on February 26. Since tourism is poised to become a major growth driver and employment generator of the economy, the day-long event had interactive sessions with Union Ministers, industry experts, travel operators, tourism boards, the hospitality sector and brand creators

How do we expand the bouquet of tourism experiences to inspire the traveller to keep coming back? How do we reintroduce favourites and invest them with contemporary sensibilities? How do we customise tours to make new memories? How has theme travel changed the way we live and think? These were some of the questions that were answered by panellists Aman Nath, Shilpa Sharma, Sumitra Senapaty, Anup Kutty and Samil Malhotra at the last session of the Exotica Tourism Summit.

Don’t let history become a bygone

Hotelier, architectural restorer and writer Aman Nath is the co-founder and co-chairman of the Neemrana Hotels chain, along with Francis Wacziarg. Both are today credited for pioneering the heritage hotels movement in India, which they started in 1991. Since then, the Neemrana group has acquired 30 heritage properties and converted them into heritage hotels after restoration, particularly developing unknown properties in Rajasthan and breaking stereotypes.

He said, “We have 30 properties in 18 states of India. We started by looking at restoring historical properties which held stories about the glorious past of India. The architecture in every state varies just like food. The idea was to make a new blend of restoration, rebuilding and revitalisation of ruined architectural wonders and offer unique accommodation options. It was to turn utter waste into mainstream assets, which nobody looked at and which could contribute to society. The term jungle mein mangal actually holds true in that you can actually create a habitat in the wilderness. Neemranification means that you restore a place and you also use it in a way that it perpetuates itself. What you know as the Neemrana Fort Palace Delhi-Jaipur highway is actually a 15th century heritage hotel. We have a historic 700-year-old property as the Hill Fort, Kesroli in Alwar. All efforts have been made to maintain the old charm of the fort while ensuring basic comforts that have come to be associated with the changes in lifestyle since the 14th century. Then we have the Bungalow on the Beach in Tranquebar, Tamil Nadu. When we started doing this project, the Government said how dare you build a property so close to the sea? We told them, it was there since the 17th century. It was actually restored one day before the tsunami. The waves crashed the walls and went over the whole building but nothing happened to it. It stayed intact because it was a hundred years old and solidly built.”

Aman summed up by saying that when you see ruins like these, you don’t have the courage to attempt a new construction. “What we actually did was restoration-for-reuse,” he said.

Let the sea set you free

Samil Malhotra, head of sales at TIRUN, brings 33 years of experience during which he has worked across various sectors with established brands. As the exclusive India representative for Royal Caribbean Cruises, a global cruiseliner with four cruise brands — Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara Club Cruises and Silversea Cruises — he highlighted how voyages have made slow travel fashionable again.

He said, “Today, Antarctica is the new Alaska. So in 2020, if you think you can take a cruise, you could go to Antarctica. There are so many misconceptions and myths about cruising. The very first is that cruises are expensive. People tend to think it’s too crowded, too confining or too boring. But that’s hardly the reality of modern-day vessels. There are so many arguments favouring why you should not go cruising rather than why you should. The word “cruise” in itself personifies what it does. A ship can go at 40 knots but it chooses to go at 10 knots. It’s because it lets you enjoy the sea. If you would like to have a relaxing holiday, if you don’t want to pack and repack, if you want to get up in a new country everyday and have 30 restaurants to eat, a casino to gamble in, a health club and spa to enjoy and immerse yourself in, watch Broadway musicals and shows at night, listen to Bob Marley and Bob Dylan during the day, you should be taking a cruise.”

Samil concluded his talk by saying, “To demystify all this, Royal Caribbean Cruises sells at approximately Rs 10,000 per person, per night. So if you take a three night package, you are just spending Rs 30,000. And you are getting everything — stay, food, alcoholic beverages (at times), entertainment, shore excursions and so on in comparison to a hotel, where just your breakfast is included. When I tell people the rates, they are just shocked. If you haven’t seen the cruise, you haven’t seen the world.”

The buzzword is solo travel

Sumitra Senapaty, known as a women’s travel expert, has logged thousands of miles around the world as a wanderer, culminating with the creation of the WOW Club travel and social platform for women 15 years ago. This has developed into an active community for women. Sumitra believes that travel brings along a sense of empowerment and a feeling of personal freedom. The WOW community also meets up for a number of social events organised exclusively for women by the club — like heritage walks, wine tastings, lunches and movie evenings as well. Sumitra has just returned from Antarctica, her second time to this part of the world.

She said, “It was a dream that I had 15 summers ago. I really wanted women to be independent and empowered. I talked to a lot of people and realised that women were more interested in travelling and adventure and a passion that brings all this alive. There are times in life when you are over with your friends, relatives and colleagues. You want to go beyond that and have a different social circle. So how do you make friends later in life? One way is travel. It gives you me-time, makes you independent and you feel empowered. It gives you an opportunity to talk to other people, locals of various countries and other states in India. It gives you time to think on your feet, to act for yourself, too. Well, I give them the opportunity for solo travel. It’s so comforting because being in a group gives you a sense of safety. We do 150 trips every year over 52 destinations. These destinations range from Rishikesh to Antartika and beyond. Future plans include the Arctic circle, Greenland and Falkland islands. The change has come for sure. Initially, when I started out, there were women who called me and said ‘wow it’s such a lovely concept! But we will get back to you after the weekend. I would like to discuss it with my family and see what happens’. Invariably, they never got back because their family said why are you going with them? Why not with us? However, later, women did come back. And how.”

Beyond the brochure

Since 2011, Shilpa Sharma, founder of Breakaway Travels, has been curating and executing bespoke, beyond-the-brochure experiential journeys around India for solo travellers. Her trips are immersions in crafts, textiles, culinary and social enterprise interactions. She co-founded Jaypore, an online retail portal for Indian handmade and high on design products and is constantly travelling to find the next experiential to curate.

She wanted to do something for her own, something that hadn’t been done by anyone. Said Shilpa, “In 2011, when I set up the company, the whole idea was to find parts of the country through travel experiences. There was a lot happening in the mainstream tourism space. People were going to Goa, Mumbai, Kerala but I wanted to present a beyond-the-brochure approach to India. I wanted to have a representation of interactions centred around crafts and textiles because that’s where I have spent 12 years of my career. I have travelled the length and breadth of the country and realised that all the beautiful products come from India. There’s an opportunity to actually travel into some of the far flung clusters, communities and interact with them at their hometowns. In those interactions you also get to experience them, their culture, food and just every aspect of their lifestyle. I feel food is our identity. Through my travels, I have figured, regional cuisine in our country is severely underrated. This is also one of the reasons which led to my third venture — a restaurant called Mustard in Goa and Mumbai.”

Shilpa added that she is now working to explore another facet of Kutch. It is associated with textiles and crafts and the great Rann of Kutch but the truth is that it is also about extinct volcanoes, rock formations, dinosaurs and fossils. “Nobody talks about these things. There is a Rajasthan that everybody knows and then there is a Rajasthan that nobody knows.” For her, it’s all about finding that needle in a haystack.

To NorthEast, with love

Former journalist and musician Anup Kutty, made the rice fields of Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh a must-stop simply by hosting a music festival there. Now in its ninth year, he has pioneered the idea of a musical quest in the Northeast, one which adds to the felt experience.

Said he, “My love story with the Northeast is just 10 years old. I am a musician, so my band was touring the Northeast in 2011. One of the promoters was from Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh. We had a show there. Unfortunately, there was some political unrest and the show got postponed. The promoter suggested, ‘Why don’t you just come to my hometown, Ziro Valley, and relax?’ We saw the place, met beautiful people and had great food. Over a couple of rice beers, we discussed how we should invite some more artistes and do a show here. Even after moving back to Delhi, the idea stuck in our heads. So we decided to do it. Our first edition was a huge mess because there were torrential rains for two days. But on the day of the fest, sun showed up, everybody landed and the show happened. That was 10 years ago. Now we have 6,000 people coming from across the world. It’s like a wedding that happens in the village, where everybody comes together and puts in his/her best efforts. The locals open up their homes for visitors. When we started, we had couple of home stays. But now, pretty much every home is open for us. The local economy has perked up too.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/living-heritage-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/living-heritage.html
152,29-2-20,World on a platter,"While Rocky Singh and Mayur Sharma spoke about their journey and building personal stories, Zorawar Kalra divulged that he decides his next destination on the basis of food

With so many images, travellers’ tales and food stories on our palmtops, how do we decide what works best for us while planning a holiday? How do we get to the must-knows beyond the photo-shopped fantasy? Simple, live the felt experiences with somebody whom you can trust and somebody who is like you. Nobody can establish this believability about themselves than Rocky Singh and Mayur Sharma, who have added a whole new layering to highway travel by exploring dhabas and elevating street food as a must-do option. So has chef Zorawar Kalra, who has used some of our known street foods to create elegant fusion fare. They were speaking at the session Seeing is Believing at the Exotica Tourism Summit.

Rocky and Mayur, who have broken barriers, hit the road, built personal stories and digital highways through their television show Highway on My Plate, shared their journey of bringing the regional Indian cuisine food to the forefront. “Our life has always been about promoting food. We started in 2007 with the emphasis to focus upon the Indian food as we have the richest food culture in the world,” said Rocky.

He then talked about weaving in his experiences as a birder with his food journeys on his Instagram account. “There are eight million registered birders in the UK and possibly more in the US. If you want to look at birding opportunities in India, we have over 1,200 species of birds, including the ones who migrate during the winters. We have some of the most phenomenal birds in the world. Everywhere you go, from Rann of Kutch to the Northeast to Kerala to Kashmir, you will find thousands of birders looking for exotic species. It is a huge business.”

Through the show, Rocky and Mayur seem to have enjoyed the diversity of the country as they travel and review dhabas on their way every 48 hours. “We have had 7,000 dishes in 12 years and still have a lot more to explore. Believe me, 100 million people would come to India if we were proud of our food culture and showed the world the richness of our cuisine,” added Rocky.

The two were running their business till they decided that they had to make their passion their living. That happened through the show, which has several avatars now. Mayur being a vegetarian only reviews one end of the spectrum of dishes. So how many of his fans have turned vegetarian? “I have no idea. Around 25 to 28 per cent Indians are vegetarian. The rest have sea food, fish and non-vegetarian dishes. Though it is a small number but now with the health tag attached to it, the numbers are growing,” said Mayur. Rocky added that as ones goes towards the coastal areas, there are hardly any vegetarians.

With food being a passion with the duo, the obvious question was if they were planning a restaurant of their own? “There’s so much of hard work and passion involved in it that I feel, probably never. But who knows? Never say, never!” said Rocky.

Another panelist Zorawar, who has nine successful outposts across India and Dubai, quipped that he was glad that Rocky and Mayur were not planning to set up one as it would mean competition for him. He talked about fusion and his experimental approach to food. His London outpost, Farzi Cafe, has been credited for changing the perception of Indian cuisine because of the use of molecular gastronomy and food theatre. “We have been experimenting with khichdi, which according to me is the most vibrant, versatile and comforting Indian dish. We have experimented and created Dal chawal aracini out of it. It is coated with bread crumbs, has a papad on top and a tomato salsa. As soon as you take a bite, you will instantly understand that it is the recreation of khichdi,” said he. The best part about papad and khichdi is the fact that every Indian State has its own version, said the restaurateur who loves playing with regional food to make it more innovative as it represents the culture of the country. It also gives him a chance to try new forms of the cuisine.

Rocky and Mayur are pushing new frontiers on the digital plane as they felt that television is no more appealing. “It is boring for people to see someone sitting on a chair in a studio every day. It is not catchy. The television is just shooting itself in the head. Unless it has a hint of creativity it will not be able to sustain itself,” said Rocky. “TV is unidirectional,” added Mayur. As the digital space is making waves and their programmes are showcased regularly there, they shared how this media had helped them promote their food journey. “It is a space to enable conversations and generate ideas. The platform gives you the chance to talk about Beera’s chicken and at the same time, share details about an idli from Gujarat. Now Indians are using it as a space to put their passion forward,” said Rocky. Mayur laid stress on the fact that the platform enables conversations. One can cater to a specific group of people and build a community with common thoughts. “Our focus is simple — be consistent, frequent and do things in such a way that you can defend yourself in everything you do,” added Mayur.

Having become a part of the profession accidentally, Rocky and Mayur realised that documenting India’s street food delicacies was something they had always wanted to do. But everything comes with its own risks and challenges. Since burgers, pastas and pizzas had firmly established their hold on everyone when they started, it was challenging to put back Indian food on the platter. But they eventually changed how people perceived a dhaba and made it a new trend. “Youngsters started looking at dhabas as a cool place. They wanted to go there and explore them,” said Mayur.

When asked if there was pressure to reinvent themselves, Rocky replied, “I believe that if you want to be interesting, just keep learning, raising your performance and reinventing the wheel. It is very important to add more skills to your existing ones and get more layered.” They even talked about travel being a teacher. The more you travel, the more you get exposed to various cultures and meet new people.

People usually decide destinations first and then look for their speciality in food. But it is the other way round for Zorawar. “All my travel has been based on food. I first decide which destination has good food and then look for other things. I plan everything on the basis of food. My most memorable trip was to Japan. After India, it has the most advanced food culture,” said he. He even shared that the first time he had a really high end meal was on his honeymoon.

For Mayur, even after 12 years, the joy for this profession remains intact. It is all about perspective. “If every morning you are excited to go to your work, just continue with it. It is all about having fun in life,” said he. This is his mantra in life. Don’t take yourself too seriously! Rocky summed up the session with Rudyard Kipling’s poem, If:

“If you can make one heap of all your winnings

And risk it in one turn of pitch-and-toss

And lose and start again at your beginnings

And never breathe a word about your loss....”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/world-on-a-platter-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/world-on-a-platter.html
153,29-2-20,Filling the gaps,"Our heritage sites not only connect us to our civilisational past but play a major role in attracting tourists. So the question that lies here is: How to develop the heritage infrastructure and increase access to these sites? Patiala Foundation chief Ravee Singh Ahluwalia, who has done pilot projects like introducing E-cabs to encourage footfalls, has an answer. At the Exotica Tourism Summit organised by The Pioneer media group he said, “We need to work on sustainable development goals in tourism. That is the key to reviving interest in our heritage structures.”

iHeritage is an initiative taken by the Patiala Foundation to explore and recognise the heritage of the city on foot. He had organised a world event of GoUNESCO in September, 2016 where more than 500 residents of the city participated. The Heritage Walk was led by the then Hon’ble Deputy Commissioner Patiala and other dignitaries of the city. It was well received by the citizens. The second heritage walk was organised at Bahadurgarh Fort in March, 2018, led by IG Range Patiala. The third heritage walk was organised at Ghuram village in September, 2018. It was led by Chief Secretary to Punjab’s Chief Minister.

“When we went to various monuments, we saw that some of these sites were not even conserved properly. That would need a lot of investment. So we thought of taking this initiative of revival forward by generating a local economy around the site,” said he.

The foundation conducted heritage walks at unexplored sites of Punjab and have explored around seven sites till date. Ahluwalia proudly shared, “Patiala, from where I come, is 257 years old. We have sites like Sangol which date back to first century, they are there from the time of the Harappan civilisation. We also have Sultanpur Lodhi where the first guru of Sikhs spent his 14 years. We recently did a heritage walk there in collaboration with the Punjab Government. The infrastructure of these sites can only develop when the governments recognise their potential and more people visit.”

Through the project, the foundation takes school kids to these sites. Till date they have taken around 5,000 students so that people become aware about it.

He has pioneered the Patiala GreenCABS, an environment-friendly project by starting E-rickshaws on speed dial. “We did an experiment in 2014. We conducted personality development classes for auto-rickshaw drivers and trained them as tourist-guides of Patiala. We took this initiative so that on the way to the sites, the rickshaw drivers could tell people about the background and history of the place,” said he. It acts as a skill enhancement for them. They can now double their income within the same time. In a small city, where Ola and Uber can’t operate, auto-rickshaws serve as a good means of transport. If we upgrade them, they can come into the mainstream.

“Instead of motivating the corporates to allocate CSR funds, it’s better to widen the scope by asking them to give protection to a particular heritage site under their CSR initiative,” added he.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/filling-the-gaps-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/filling-the-gaps.html
154,29-2-20,"The known,unknown and the unsung","Gustasp and Jeroo Irani delve into the city of Jaipur to find treasures beyond the obvious

We weren’t debutante tourists in Jaipur but repeat visitors enthralled by an enchanting city. Over several visits, we had explored most of Jaipur’s awesome roster of attractions and realised that the city’s sights could give other great metros an inferiority complex. Throw in unforgettable cameos of proud locals in colourful turbans and handlebar moustaches; village belles in swirling skirts and chunky silver jewellery and proud camels squatting in the sand… Soon, Jaipur begins to resemble a stage set up with extravagant props.

But it’s all very real and we decided to re-visit some of its known architectural marvels and scoop out some of its hidden treasures as well. A quick stop at the 18th century Hawa Mahal or Palace of Wind wasn’t enough. Locals ushered us up narrow stairs, above a warren of shops opposite the monument, to get picture- postcard-perfect photographs of the palace. The pink, five-storey palace, honey-combed with over 150 latticed windows enabled ladies to watch unseen life and processions swirl on the broad street below. On a terrace across Hawa Mahal, perched precariously on a parapet, some selfie-struck tourists posed, pirouetted and pouted in front of cell phones held aloft to get the Hawa Mahal as a backdrop to their preening selves.

One of the country’s first planned cities, the origins of Jaipur go back to 1727 when Jai Singh II, Raja of Amer, traded his grand palace within the fortified walls of Amer Fort for an even more magnificent city, to be named after him. Jaipur was dubbed the Pink City in 1876 when Sawai Ram Singh I who had the city painted pink in honour of the visit of Prince of Wales’, who was later crowned King Edward VII. Ever since, and even today, the city has been getting a coat of fresh paint every once in a while.

To escape the traffic-clogged streets of the old city, we retreated for a while into the rambling City Palace, a maze of cool courtyards, gardens and palaces from different eras where royal memorabilia is on display. There we stumbled on a Craft Centre where visitors can view and buy goods directly from craftsmen and artists personally selected by a member of the royal family and asked to set up shop.

We sat next to an artist and watched his paintbrush glide over the paper. The crisp clean lines that danced across his canvas started to merge and a few moments later, he handed us his creation: a miniature painting of a fierce Rajput prince with a sword held aloft and ready to strike. The contrast between the menacing posture of the handsome young warrior in the painting and the gentle demeanour of the wrinkled old artist who created it was striking, and in many ways captured the spirit of Jaipur. For this is a city that is both artistic and imposing; a city of fantasy with modern contours.

As a break from Jaipur’s history-webbed monuments, we stopped at Channi Carpets and Textiles, a factory-cum showroom, one of the oldest in the city, where on an upper floor, hand-knotted carpets in wool, silk and a blend of silk and wool cascaded down walls or were rolled up against them. They were then strewn and unfurled on the floor for us to gawk at and perhaps buy. The carpets and rugs with Persian, Kashmiri, oriental and other designs glowed and shimmered and we realised how art and beauty are woven into the DNA of the city. In a ground floor atelier, artisans demonstrated the art of block printing with vegetable dyes and teak wood blocks. They even encouraged us to try our hand at it.

Shopping sprees can be addictive in a city where the past continues to burnish the present. We would take frequent breaks from tumultuous Jaipur, at the recently re-launched Ibis Jaipur Civil Lines hotel in the city centre. Functional, funky and the epitome of modern-day cool, the relaunched Ibis Jaipur Civil Lines offers guests the option to go green, peddle away and explore the city on their e bikes. A gaily painted auto rickshaw, minus the beeps so typical of the city, is an arresting art installation in the porch where guests love to click some mandatory selfies. When we felt overpowered by the city’s manifold charms, we would often relax in the vibrant lobby which flows seamlessly into the restaurant; pour over the inventive menu and admire the witty doodles by local artists on the walls and tables which cleverly evoke Jaipur life.

On our last evening, we headed for Amer Fort, the former capital. En route to the fort, we saw another enchanting marvel that Jaipur showcases so casually, typical of a city that suffers from an embarrassment of riches…We stopped to gaze at the recently restored Jal Mahal or water palace moored in the middle of Man Sagar Lake. A hidden gem, oft-overlooked by tourists on their way to the muscled Amer Fort, the Jal Mahal is a lake palace that exudes feminine charm and romance. It was once the playground of the maharajas in the 18th century when it resonated with the sounds of duck hunting parties, firework displays and elaborate music and dance festivals. In its heyday, the palace was strewn with silk pillows and glowing carpets, and the courtyard and corridors were shaded with rich awnings. Today, a forlorn beauty clings to it.

The 16th century Amer Fort is another eyeful and as the fading light of a post-sunset sky brushed its ramparts, we quickly explored its labyrinthine but stunning interior. Massive arched gates protect the outer courtyard which is dominated by the many arched Diwan-e-Aam or hall of public audience. The main palace complex is tucked away behind walls and archways alive with a mosaic of inlaid images. The magnificent Diwan-e-Khas or hall of private audience, elaborate gardens and courtyards, a hall of mirrors that recreates star-studded night skies, the private residential quarters of the king and his queens cooled by breeze blowing across channels of water and filigreed walls with delicate designs speak eloquently of a love for opulence...

And as the sky darkened, the Sound and Light show brought the past back to centre stage once again as in a dramatic play, the story of Amer Fort unfolded. Twenty-eight kings of the Kachwaha dynasty ruled from this impressive fort till the capital was moved to Jaipur. Local legends and folk music enhanced the delve-into-the-past experience while the stunning setting of the Amer Fort and Palace complex in the foreground and the Jaigarh Fort to the left, back-dropped by shadowy hills reverberated with the thunder of battle and galloping horses; the thrust and parry of swords, the cries of fallen soldiers, and of bereft princesses left grieving in their opulent citadels.

After the show, we headed to Sahu Restaurant in the old city to warm up. Sahu, famed for its hot milky tea served in an earthen kulhad, turned out be a hole-in-the-wall tea stall which was set up by the present owner’s grandfather and is now a popular “watering hole” for locals.

The sweet milky tea is slowly brewed on a coal fire with a dash of their secret masala. Anything between 1,500 to 2,000 cups a day are consumed as the stall is open from 5 am to 11 pm. Political heavyweights and even royalty have stopped by for a sip of the beverage, with which they wash down the sting of mirch vadas.

But it was at the over 50-year-old Rawat Mishtan Bhandar (a takeaway with a restaurant attached) that we found the flavours of Jaipur packaged into crisp mava, potato and onion kachoris; mirch vada, lassi, sweets and other delicacies. A magnet for locals and the Indian diaspora visiting Jaipur, we were told that the kachoris are carried all the way to the US and last for seven days when refrigerated.

Our voyage of discovery ended with a taste of city at Spice It, the edgy, modern restaurant at Ibis Jaipur Civil Lines, where we savoured timeless and succulent local specialties like Laal maas and Gatta curry for which Rajasthan is famed. We were aware that in this Land of Kings, we were biting into hefty chunks of history.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-known-unknown-and-the-unsung-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-known-unknown-and-the-unsung.html

158,29-2-20,Turkey threatens Europe with refugees,"The Presidents of Turkey and Russia spoke over the phone on Friday, a day after Syrian Government airstrikes killed 33 Turkish troops, significantly ratcheting up tensions between Ankara and Moscow. It was the highest number of Turkish soldiers killed in a single day since Ankara first intervened in the Syrian conflict in 2016.

The development was the most serious escalation in the conflict between Turkish and Russia-backed Syrian forces and raised the prospect of all-out war with millions of Syrian civilians trapped in the middle.

NATO envoys held emergency talks at the request of Turkey, a NATO member, and scores of migrants began converging on Turkey’s border with Greece seeking entry into Europe after Turkey said it was “no longer able to hold refugees.” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country already hosts more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees, has long threatened to “open the gates” for millions of refugees eager to flee to Europe unless more international support was provided.

Refugees, meanwhile, headed to the land border with Greece, taking minibuses and taxis from Istanbul. Dozens waited at the Turkish side of the border gate at Pazarkule and dozens of others were in no-man’s land between the two countries.

Others headed to Turkey’s west coast to attempt to reach the Greek islands, a short distance away. Several rubber dinghy boats with groups of people clambering aboard were seen on Friday, heading for the island of Lesbos after apparently setting off from Ayvacik, northwest Turkey in broad daylight.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/turkey-threatens-europe-with-refugees.html

Also on Friday in Idlib, four members of a single family, two of them children, were killed in air strikes, the Britain-based monitoring group said.

160,29-2-20,"Experts question delayed action as death toll climbs to over 2,780","Forty four more people have died of the novel coronavirus in China, taking the death toll in the outbreak to 2,788, Chinese health officials said on Friday, amid growing criticism from experts and the public that the epidemic would have been less severe if the authorities acted when the first confirmed case was reported in December.

Among the deaths reported on Thursday, 41 were from the epicentre Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, two in Beijing and one in Xinjiang, the National Health Commission said in its daily report.

A total of 44 new deaths and 327 confirmed cases were reported on Thursday from all over China, far lower than the earlier days, it said.

The overall confirmed cases in the mainland have reached 78,824 by the end of Thursday. In all, 2,788 people have died of the disease so far, it said. As virulence of the disease slowed, criticism of Chinese officials’ attempts to hide the outbreak in its early stage was highlighted by the official media on Thursday in a rare public criticism of the system of secrecy in governance.

The outbreak first surfaced in December last year until it became severe by middle of January, becoming a full-fledged epidemic causing massive devastation in the country, a report highlighting the shortcomings was published by the state-run Global Times on Thursday.

While China’s massive response in trying to localise the virus to Hubei province with strong measure like locking over 18 cities including Wuhan with over 50 million people came for praise from the World Health Organisation (WHO), criticism is also growing at home over why it was not nipped in the bud.

The situation should have been better if the control measures were taken earlier Zhong Nanshan, said a leading epidemiologist who was also among those in the expert groups dispatched by the central Government to the epicentre Wuhan.

Under the scanner is China’s famous top down approach under the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) with little power to local officials.

Several top-down authorities, constantly shifting blame on each other for mishandling the outbreak earlier, have now been engulfed in a public opinion crisis, with people calling for an improved decision-making process in the country’s healthcare system, the media report said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/experts-question-delayed-action-as-death-toll-climbs-to-over-2-780.html

165,29-2-20,Greek tragedy,"Olympiakos knock Arsenal out in dying seconds

Youssef El-Arabi scored in the last minute of extra-time as Olympiakos knocked Arsenal out of the Europa League on Thursday on a night when four former European champions were eliminated.

Ajax, Celtic, Benfica and Porto went out but Manchester United hardly broke sweat after Simon Deli of Brugge conceded a penalty and earned a red card in the 23rd minute at Old Trafford and won 5-0.

Arsenal had won the first leg of the round of 32 tie 1-0 in Greece.

Defender Pape Abou Cisse cancelled out that advantage when he headed in a corner after 53 minutes.

Arsenal could not break through and were forced to extra time.

Giorgos Masouras hit the bar for Olympiakos in the 112th minute and a minute later Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck for Arsenal, putting them back in front with a spectacular flying kick.

However, in the final minute of extra time, Arsenal cleared an Olympiakos corner but were still disorganised when the ball was swung back into the area.

The cross found El Arabi free in front of goal for an unchallenged shot.

“Very hard, very tough,” said Aubameyang. “Their last-minute goal was unlucky for us.”

Last year Arsenal reached the final.

“It hurts a lot,” said Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager. “Attack against defence in 25 metres is difficult, but we created enough chances to win the game comfortably.”

Olympiakos coach Pedro Martins was delighted.

“We were determined, we believed we could qualify and we made it,” said he said. “Tactical intelligence, effectiveness, inner strength, courage...they all weighed in this success.”

At Old Trafford, one of United’s recent signings Bruno Fernandes gave the hosts the lead with a penalty after Deli’s flying intervention.

The other new boy, Odion Ighalo, making his first start, hit his first goal for the club in the 34th minute.

“I have been waiting for this,” said Ighalo. “It’s a moment I’ll cherish for the rest of my life.”

Scott McTominay and Fred, with two late goals, completed the 5-0 rout and 6-1 aggregate win.

“The football we played at times pleased me the most,” said Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the Manchester United manager.

“The players are smiling, they are playing with confidence and that is what we want. The new lads have brought that in.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/greek-tragedy-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/greek-tragedy.html
166,29-2-20,T20 can’t survive without Test cricket: Hadlee,"New Zealand pace great Sir Richard Hadlee is not a fan of T20 cricket and has no qualms in asserting that the shortest format will not survive if Tests are not taken care of.

Hadlee said the foundation of cricket must be “preserved” and all three formats can co-exist if a balance is struck.

“Test cricket must be preserved. It’s the foundation on which the game is based. So we must look after the five-day game,” Hadlee said.

“Certainly with emergence of T20 cricket which is a revolution in the game, all three formats need to live together. They can co-exist but I hate to see that T20 cricket will dominate world cricket,” the 69-year-old made his preference clear.

He is very sure that T20 cricket won’t be able to sustain the game if the traditional format is not taken care of.

“Probably too much T20 cricket is played around the world. But I hope that the game doesn’t try to just survive through T20 cricket because T20 cricket is not real cricket. Real cricket is Test cricket,” said Hadlee, the owner of 431 Test wickets and 3124 runs from only 86 Tests.

Hadlee, however, feels that T20 has produced more skillful players even though they might not be better cricketers.

“I am not saying they are better players but they are certainly more skillful. Because of different formats that they play, they have to adapt to different situations particularly in T20 which is a high risk game anyway with all the trick shots that they play,” he stated.

“The T20 generation bowlers today have for at least five variations. Back in my time, I only had two variations (inswinger and outswinger). That’s all I needed,” he concluded.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/t20-can---t-survive-without-test-cricket--hadlee.html
167,29-2-20,Indian batting’s test against NZ’s short ball tactic,"Their pride bruised and technique exposed in adverse conditions, India’s famed batting line-up will face its hour of reckoning against a New Zealand pace attack, threatening to be relentless with its short ball tactic in the second Test starting today.

The ignominy of a defeat in less than five days in a World Test Championship encounter has certainly jolted a batting line-up that prides itself in performing in tough conditions.

And none other than coach Ravi Shastri is first to agree.

“A shake up like this is good as it opens your mindset. When you are on the road all the time and have not tasted defeat, it can close your mindset,” Shastri was forthright in his admission that complacency had crept in somewhere.

Come today, the Virat Kohlis, Cheteshwar Pujaras and Ajinkya Rahanes will face an even tougher test on a green top at the Hagley Oval where the Black Caps have won all but one Test.

With the peerless practitioner of the short-ball tactic Neil Wagner joining Tim Southee, Trent Boult and Kyle Jamieson in aiming for the rib cage from round the wicket, there will be more probing questions on offer during the next five days.

What the Indian team would want is one among Ajinkya Rahane, Hanuma Vihari and Cheteshwar Pujara to show positive intent as their identical defensive game is bound to put too much pressure on skipper Kohli. One good news for India was that Prithvi Shaw was back in the nets with an extensive session under watchful eyes of the coach and some valuable tips from the skipper. “Prithvi is ready to go,” the coach cleared the air on the opener’s fitness.

However there was some bad news as well with senior speedster and team’s best bowler in the first Test, Ishant Sharma aggravating his right ankle injury that he had suffered during a Ranji Trophy game last month.

As per team sources, Ishant’s scan report is awaited and he looks doubtful as of now.

The visitors, in all likelihood, will have two changes in the playing XI from the last Test with Ravichandran Ashwin likely to lose his spot to Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh Yadav or Navdeep Saini will be inducted in case Ishant fails to make it.

While Shastri said that a call will be taken tomorrow (before toss) on Jadeja and Ashwin, he gave enough hints that Saurashtra all-rounder has his nose ahead.

For New Zealand, it could be an all-pace attack considering that Ajaz Patel, the specialist left arm spinner, had precious little to do at the Basin Reserve.

With Wagner getting his place back, the team management would find it difficult to bench Jamieson who won Man of the Match award on Test debut.

The green pitch will be hard, even bouncy with good carry, according to curator and that’s exactly what Boult & Co wants.

For the Indian team, it’s not only about batting as Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami’s underwhelming show at the Basin has also been a cause of concern. Their length was awry and failure to get the tail-enders quickly stuck out like a sore thumb.

Bumrah, in particular, has had an indifferent tour and this is the first time in his four year international career where he is experiencing a bad patch.

The left-arm spinner ran through the Sri Lankan batting line-up, claiming the prized scalp of skipper Chamari Atapattu, in the process.

Opting to bat, Sri Lanka were dealt an early blow when opener Umesha Thimashini (2) tried to go for a big shot off a Deepti Sharma delivery but was caught by Rajeshwari Gayakwad in the third over.

However, left-arm spinner Gayakwad tightened the screws in the eighth over, bowling a wicket maiden as she dismissed Madavi.

The introduction of Radha in the ninth over by India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur worked superbly as immediately after hitting a six over deep wicket the Sri Lankan captain was caught at square leg.

Sri Lanka then suffered a batting collapse as Radha accounted for Hansima Karunaratne (7) and Hasini Perera (7) in her next. She also dismissed wicket-keeper Anushka Sanjeewani (1).

170,29-2-20,Nadal strolls into Acapulco final,"Rafael Nadal used a steady stream of blistering forehand winners and a heavy dose of precision serves to book his spot in the ATP Mexico Open final with a convincing 6-3, 6-2 win over Grigor Dimitrov.

The two-time tournament champion will be the favorite to claim his third Acapulco title when he faces unseeded Taylor Fritz in Saturday's final.

It has been 15 years since world No. 2 Nadal won for the first time here. He also won in 2013 and improved to 18-2 at this event overall.

""I'm very happy. A great victory against one of the best players in the world and a good friend,"" Nadal said after his one-sided victory on Friday night.

""I think I've increased my level during the match, so it's positive for me."" The top seed clinched the victory on his first match point. He fell behind 0-30 in the final game but rallied to win the next four points.

On match point, seventh seed Dimitrov hit a backhand that clipped the top of the net and bounced in. But it hung in the air just long enough for Nadal to race forward and blast a cross-court forehand that the Bulgarian had no chance on.

Nadal continued his dominance of Dimitrov, improving to 13-1 lifetime. Nadal has only lost 20 games in his first four matches this week and is yet to lose a set. The unseeded Fritz defeated fellow American John Isner in the other semi-final 2-6, 7-5, 6-3.

""He's playing well. He has a great serve, fantastic shots from the baseline. It's going to be a tough one,"" Nadal said of Fritz.

""I know I'm going to have to be at my best and I hope to be ready for it."" This will be the first meeting between Nadal and 22-year-old Fritz.

The second set progressed nearly identically to the first set, with Dimitrov breaking early for a 2-0 lead before Nadal stormed back.

Nadal finished out the night by going on a six-game run.

Last year, Woods withdrew from the Arnold Palmer Invitational with a neck strain, then played in the Players and the WGC Match Play before going to Augusta National.

Woods captured his fifth green jacket and first major triumph in 11 years, an epic comeback tale from spinal fusion surgery and multiple back operations that had him doubting at one stage if he would have a normal life much less play golf again.

175,29-2-20,Clash of equals,"The bowling strengths of hosts Saurashtra and Gujarat will be put to test on what is likely to be a flat track when the two sides battle it out in the first semifinal of the Ranji Trophy, starting here today.

The Jaydev Unadkat-led side runs into a strong Gujarat team, which has built its momentum slowly through the tournament.

But last year’s runner-up, Saurashtra will look to cash in on the home advantage with an all-round display.

Gujarat comes into the game after thrashing Goa by a whopping 464 runs, while Saurashtra made the grade courtesy a massive first innings lead against Andhra.

Gujarat skipper Parthiv Patel struck form at the right time with a superb century in the quarterfinal after having endured indifferent outing in the league phase and will be keen to carry on the momentum.

All their other batsmen — be it Bhargav Merai (621 runs), Manprit Juneja (449 runs) or Samit Gohel have runs under their belt and would be expected to play their parts.

Gujarat opener Priyank Panchal has endured a lean run by his own standard and would be raring to find form at the SCA Stadium.

Pacers Roosh Kalaria (33 wickets), who also excelled with the bat in the quarter-final, and Arzan Nagaswalla (34 wickets) have done exceedingly well but it will be a challenge for them to bowl on a placid track.

Spinner Siddharth Desai is expected to play a crucial role, especially on the fourth and fifth days.

For Saurashtra, coached by former India pacer Karsan Ghavri, skipper Unadkat has led from the front by picking up 55 wickets, the most by any bowler this season.

He will, however need support from his teammates. Spinner Dharmendrasinh Jadeja will have to step up his game if Saurashtra hope to restrict a strong Gujarat batting line-up.

On the batting front, Sheldon Jackson (680 runs) and Arpit Vasavada (515 runs) have been their mainstays. But the likes of Harvik Desai, Snell Patel have under-performed and need to give the hosts a solid start.

It will thus be a battle of equals as the teams match in each and each department and whoever handles pressure better, will advance to the final.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/clash-of-equals.html

177,29-2-20,Eves look to iron out batting woes,"A semifinal berth secured, the unbeaten Indian women’s cricket team would look to address some of its batting issues in the final Group A match against a deflated Sri Lanka in the T20 World Cup match here today.

The Indians are on a roll, having easily sealed their semifinal berth with wins over defending champions Australia, Bangladesh and New Zealand. The Lankans, on the other hand, are out of the semifinal race following two losses so far.

And come today, the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side would look to end its group engagements on a high when it takes on the islanders.

But the Indians definitely have a few things to worry about, especially their below-par show with the bat, going into the business end of the tournament.

In all the previous three outings, India failed to put on big scores on the board. They managed just 132 runs against Australia, 142 against Bangladesh and 133 vs New Zealand.

India’s unpredictable middle-order has repeatedly squandered good starts to eventually settle for low scores.

In all the three matches, the bowling unit came to India’s rescue and the bailed the side out.

Heavily reliant on the brilliance of a 16-year-old Shafali Verma, the Indian middle-order has cut a sorry figure so far and it’s time senior pros like Harmanpreet and Veda Krishnamurthy step up and take the responsibility.

Opener Smriti Mandhana too has failed to join the party so far.

The Indian bowling, however, has been phenomenal in the tournament so far and played a vital role in their smooth entry into the last-four round.

Leg-spinner Poonam Yadav has been the star performer for India, picking up eight wickets so far. She has been complimented well by the likes of Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Deepti Sharma and pacer Shikha Pandey.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/eves-look-to-iron-out-batting-woes.html

Sune Luus chipped in with a 41-ball 61, which was studded with five hits to the fence and two sixes.

186,29-2-20,'Shoot the traitors' slogans at march called against 'jihadi terrorism',"BJP leader Kapil Mishra, who is facing flak for allegedly making provocative statements before communal riots broke out in northeast Delhi, and families of some of the victims of the violence participated in a ""march against jihadi terrorism"" taken out in Connaught Place on Saturday during which some people raised slogans of 'shoot the traitors'.

Mishra did not join the sloganeering or address the gathering during the 'peace march' organised by NGO Delhi Peace Forum from Jantar Mantar to Parliament Street police station.

At Jantar Mantar, slogans of 'Jai Shri Ram' and 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' were raised as hundreds of people gathered holding the tricolour. Some of the victims and families of those who lost their lives in the violence in northeast Delhi narrated their ordeal.

When the march passed through Connaught Place, slogans of 'shoot the traitors' were raised.

The organisers paid tributes to Head Constable Ratan Lal and IB staffer Ankit Sharma, who were killed during the violence that has claimed 42 lives till now.

Suresh Kumar said his brother Dinesh Kumar Khatik was shot when he had gone to see whether shops were open on February 25.

""He was shot near Shiv Vihar puliya where petrol bombs were also used. I found him at GTB Hospital where he was on ventilator support. The next day he succumbed to injuries. He is survived by two children, a one-year-old and a seven-year-old,"" he said.

Alok Tiwari was shot in the head while he was returning home on Tuesday from the Karawal Nagar factory where he worked, his brother-in-law Sumit said.

""His fault was that he had just stopped to see whether he could buy fruits for children. My sister got to know that he had been attacked and with the help of neighbours he was taken to hospital where he succumbed to injuries the next day.

""He leaves behind a four-year-old son and a nine-year-old daughter. The children keep asking about their father but we do not know how to face them,"" he said.

Other speakers at the event alleged that the communal violence was ""well-planned"" and was aimed to ""target the Hindus"".

Lt General Kohli, one of the speakers, said, ""This is being done to discredit police and down their morale. We have made police punching bags. We have to be alert citizens and expose those amid us who are responsible for such attacks.""

BJP leader Mishra did not address the gathering though he earlier posted a tweet asking the people to join the protest at Jantar Mantar.

He also posted videos of the march and said: ""No matter how much falsehood you spread, the people know the truth"".

Facing allegations of making provocative speeches, Mishra has maintained that he did nothing wrong and had only demanded that the roads be cleared of anti-CAA protesters.

Lt Gen Vijay Chaturvedi also termed the violence as a ""well-planned"" conspiracy and said those who were involved were well-trained and equipped to use molotov cocktails.

""This was specially carried out during US President Donald Trump's visit,"" he said.

Earlier in the day, pro-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) sloganeering and incendiary chants of ""shoot the traitors"" were made inside a train on Delhi Metro's Blue Line and also at the Rajiv Chowk metro station here on Saturday by a group of young men.

The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), responsible for the security of the Delhi Metro, said it had detained six people and handed them over to the Delhi Police.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-shoot-the-traitors--slogans-at-march-called-against--jihadi-terrorism--2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/-shoot-the-traitors--slogans-at-march-called-against--jihadi-terrorism-.html
187,29-2-20,"US, Taliban sign historic deal on Afghanistan's future","The United States signed a landmark deal with the Taliban on Saturday, laying out a timetable for a full troop withdrawal from Afghanistan within 14 months as it seeks an exit from its longest-ever war.

The agreement is expected to lead to a dialogue between the Taliban and the Kabul government that, if successful, could ultimately see an end to the grinding 18-year conflict.

Taliban fighter-turned-dealmaker Mullah Baradar signed the accord alongside Washington's chief negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad, at a gilded desk in a conference room in a luxury Doha hotel.

The pair then shook hands, as people in the room shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest).

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo looked on as the two inked the deal, after urging the insurgents to ""keep your promises to cut ties with Al-Qaeda"".

On the eve of the signing, President Donald Trump urged the Afghan people to embrace the chance for a new future.

""If the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan live up to these commitments, we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home,"" he said.

But the position of the Afghan government, which has been excluded from direct US-Taliban talks, remains unclear and the country is gripped by a fresh political crisis amid contested election results.

The Doha accord was drafted over a tempestuous year of dialogue marked by the abrupt cancellation of the effort by Trump in September.

The signing comes after a week-long, partial truce that has mostly held across Afghanistan, aimed at building confidence between the warring parties and showing the Taliban can control their forces.

The United States and its allies will withdraw all their forces from Afghanistan within 14 months if the Taliban abide by the terms of the accord.

After an initial reduction of troops to 8,600 within 135 days of Saturday's signing, the US and its partners ""will complete withdrawal of all remaining forces from Afghanistan"" within 14 months.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg heralded the agreement as a ""first step to lasting peace"".

""The way to peace is long and hard. We have to be prepared for setbacks, spoilers, there is no easy way to peace but this is an important first step,"" the Norwegian former prime minister told reporters in Kabul.

Since the US-led invasion that ousted the Taliban after the September 11, 2001 attacks, America has spent more than $1 trillion in fighting and rebuilding in Afghanistan.

About 2,400 US soldiers have been killed, along with unknown tens of thousands of Afghan troops, Taliban fighters and Afghan civilians.

The insurgents said they had halted all hostilities Saturday in honour of the agreement.

""Since the deal is being signed today, and our people are happy and celebrating it, we have halted all our military operations across the country,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP.

Any insurgent pledge to guarantee Afghanistan is never again used by jihadist movements such as Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group to plot attacks abroad will be key to the deal's viability.

The Taliban's sheltering of Al-Qaeda was the main reason for the US invasion following the 9/11 attacks.

The group, which had risen to power in the 1990s in the chaos of civil war, suffered a swift defeat at the hands of the US and its allies. They retreated before re-emerging to lead a deadly insurgency against the new government in Kabul.

After the NATO combat mission ended in December 2014, the bulk of Western forces withdrew from the country, leaving it in an increasingly precarious position.

While Afghans are eager to see an end to the violence, experts say any prospective peace will depend on the outcome of talks between the Taliban and the Kabul government.

But with President Ashraf Ghani and rival Abdullah Abdullah at loggerheads over contested election results, few expect the pair to present a united front, unlike the Taliban, who would then be in a position to take the upper hand in negotiations.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us--taliban-sign-historic-deal-on-afghanistan-s-future-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/us--taliban-sign-historic-deal-on-afghanistan-s-future.html

More than 90 per cent of the new cases were in Daegu, the centre of the country's outbreak, and its neighbouring North Gyeongsang province, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.

Three women in the Daegu area died of the illness, taking the national toll to 16, the statement added. One of the victims was aged in her 90s.

The national total is expected to rise further with screening of more than 210,000 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive entity often accused of being a cult that is linked to around half of the country's cases.

The streets of Daegu -- South Korea's fourth-largest city with a population of 2.5 million -- have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale.

Authorities have urged the public to exercise caution and anyone with a fever or respiratory symptoms to stay home.

196,29-2-20,Indians at higher kidney disease risk due to air pollution,"Researchers have found that people living in countries with higher levels of air pollution such as India and China may face higher risks of developing kidney diseases.

The findings may be especially important for parts of the world with higher air pollution where fine particulate matter levels are five to 10 times higher than in the US, the study said.

It's known that breathing in air pollution can have detrimental health effects beyond the lungs, but few studies have shown how it impacts the kidneys, which act as filters for the blood.

""As rates of chronic kidney disease rise worldwide, it is important to understand whether and how exposure to air pollution plays a role,"" said study researcher Matthew F. Blum from the Johns Hopkins University in the US.

For the findings, published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, the research team examined information on 10,997 adults across four sites in the US who were followed from 1996-1998 through 2016.

The researchers estimated the monthly average levels of tiny particles of air pollution -- called fine particulate matter -- based on participants' home addresses.

Fine particulate matter comes from a variety of sources including fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, and natural sources, they said.

The team found that exposure to higher amounts of fine particulate matter was associated with a higher degree of albuminuria -- a marker of kidney dysfunction -- as well as a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease over time.

According to the researchers, future studies should examine whether efforts to improve air quality yield health benefits, including reducing rates of chronic kidney disease.

198,29-2-20,"Death toll of coronavirus in China climbs to 2,835 with 47 more fatalities","Forty seven more people have died of the deadly coronavirus, rasing the death toll in the country to 2,835 while the number of confirmed cases climbed to 79,251, Chinese health officials said on Saturday.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) in its daily report on Saturday said it received reports of 427 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection and 47 deaths on Friday.

Among the deaths reported, 45 were from the epicentre of the virus Hubei Province, one in Beijing and Henan respectively, it said.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland have reached 79,251 by the end of Friday, and 2,835 people have died of the disease, it said.

The virus, though slowing down its virulence, continued to affect more people as another 248 new suspected cases were reported taking the total to 1,418 people.

Also on Friday, 2,885 people were discharged from the hospitals after recovery, while the number of severe cases decreased by 288 to 7,664, the NHC said.

A total of 39,002 people have been discharged from the hospitals after the recovery.

By the end of Friday, 94 confirmed cases, including two deaths, have been reported in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 34 in Taiwan, including one death.

Meanwhile, a senior World Health Organisation (WHO) expert said in Geneva on Friday that it is unhelpful to declare a pandemic when people are still trying to contain COVID-19, although the WHO has raised the epidemic risk alert to the highest level.

The WHO revised on Friday the risk assessment of the COVID-19 from ""high"" to ""very high"" at global level, as an increasing number of cases in more countries were reported over the last few days.

""A Pandemic is a unique situation, in which all citizens on the planet will likely be exposed to a virus within a defined period of time,"" state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO Health Emergencies Programme as saying.

However, in the case of COVID-19, it has been proved that the course of the epidemic can be significantly altered through containment measures and robust public health response, the expert noted.

The word ""pandemic"" is ""colloquial,"" Ryan said, appealing for actions that go beyond colloquial terms.

The existing data do not support the concept of a pandemic so far, he said, highlighting that China has clearly shown that it is not necessarily the natural outcome of the COVID-19 epidemic if indispensable responses are made quickly.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-reports-47-more-coronavirus-deaths-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/death-toll-of-coronavirus-in-china-climbs-to-2-835-with-47-more-fatalities.html

202,29-2-20,F-35 has no chance against a drone fighter plane: Elon Musk,"SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is confident that the traditional warfare era is long over and the future belongs to drone fighter planes that will dominate the sky and F-35 fighter jets will have nowhere to go.

Addressing the gathering at Air Warfare Symposium organised by the US Air Force in Florida on Friday, Musk said the age of fighter jets dominating the sky is over.

""For the air domain... things are definitely going to go into, kind of... locally autonomous drone warfare... is where the future will be... It's not I want the future to be this, this is what the future will be, autonomous drone warfare...,"" The Drive reported Musk as saying.

""Drones locally will be autonomous, but I think we still want to retain the authority to damage or destroy anything that isn't an autonomous drone. Keep the authority back there with a person in the loom. The fighter jet era has passed. It's drones,"" Musk added.

Later, in a tweet, the SpaceX founder said: ""The competitor should be a drone fighter plane that's remote controlled by a human, but with its maneuvers augmented by autonomy. The F-35 would have no chance against it"".

He stressed that F-35 stealth jet ""would have no chance"" against a drone remotely piloted by a human.

The US Air Force successfully tested an advanced, jet-powered drone called the XQ58-A Valkyrie recently that could accompany human-piloted fighter jets on missions.

The autonomous unmanned vehicle, can play a key role in electronic warfare, strike and surveillance on the battlefield.

According to New Atlas, the Valkyrie can carry a small payload of smart bombs, and has a range of just under 2,500 miles. The F-16 Fighting Falcon tops out at just over 2,600 miles while the F-22 Raptor has a range of over 1,800 miles.

Musk also discussed about making a Starfleet real at the symposium.

""How do we make Starfleet real?"" he asked, stressing that reusable launch vehicles are ""absolutely fundamental"" to achieving whatever space ambitions the military might have, including staying ahead of China.

""I think we can go a long way to make Starfleet real and these utopian futures real"".

""The foundation of war is economics. If you have half the resources of the counter-party then you better be real innovative because [otherwise] we're going to lose… The US will be, militarily, second,"" Musk said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/f-35-has-no-chance-against-a-drone-fighter-plane--elon-musk-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/f-35-has-no-chance-against-a-drone-fighter-plane--elon-musk.html
203,29-2-20,NE Delhi picks up pieces,"Under new boss SN Shrivastava, cops regaining public confidence in policing

The change of guard in the Delhi Police on Friday has coincided with the return of the normalcy in the riot-affected areas of North-east district in the national Capital. Heavy police presence and effective patrolling have encouraged people to reopen shops selling essential supplies such as milk, medicines, kitchen items, start using private vehicles on the roads.

Newly-appointed Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava made it amply clear to the people that his top priority will be to ensure safety of the people and maintaining law and order. “The police are there for them,” said Shrivastava, who will take over as Delhi Police Commissioner on Sunday.

All the peace committees have been activated and the respectable from both the communities have been roped in to help in establish peace and tranquility in the areas that have seen largescale violence and bloodshed.

The presence of Shrivastava — IPS officer of the 1985 batch — on the ground has helped the rank and file of the beleaguered force to work with purpose and firmness. Shrivastava, who will be taking up the reins of 85,000 Delhi Police force soon from his batchmate and the outgoing police chief Amulya Patnaik, has shifted from the CRPF by the Ministry of Home Affairs to contain the situation.

Meanwhile on Friday, four more victims of the riots succumbed to their injuries raising the death toll to 42. Doctors attending to the injured patients said they are doing their best but some of them are highly critical and the toll may go up in the coming days. More than 250 people have been injured in the communal clashes that broke out across northeast Delhi in areas such as Jaffrabad, Maujpur, Chand Bagh, Khureji Khas and Bhajanpura.

Meanwhile, heavy police presence and the announcement by the police on public address systems started to have its affect as more shops and other establishments opened up as the day progressed in some places and more private vehicles were seen on roads. Autos and e-rickshaws also began plying in some areas as people stepped out of their homes to get back to work or to run errands.

As clouds of smoke from burning properties/vehicles cleared on Friday, it revealed the extent of the damage from the worst riots in the city in more than three decades.

While civic workers swept the streets and bylanes off bricks, broken glass and other debris of three days of communal clashes, some shopkeepers sorted through the charred remains of their vandalised and burnt shops. Police and paramilitary personnel maintained strict vigil in view of Friday prayers at mosques.

Local mosques in appealed for peace and harmony in the riot-hit areas. The imams of mosques appealed to people to be united and not fall prey to rumours, urging people to report about suspicious people to the authorities and cooperate with the police.

“In case of any emergency, please call on 112,” the announcement said.

Delhi Police officials also said they were making extra efforts to deal with rumours, and were holding regular flag marches and interactions in the neighbourhoods of affected areas as confidence-building measures.

He said 331 peace meetings have been held in the affected areas over the last two days. Shrivastava was repatriated from the Central Reserve Police Force and appointed as the Special Commissioner (Law and Order) of the Delhi Police earlier this week when the violence started.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the Delhi Government has set up nine shelters for the riot-affected people and is distributing food among them.

Addressing the media, Kejriwal said the Government has started distributing Rs 25,000 in cash, as part of compensation, to those whose houses have been burnt during the violence in northeast Delhi earlier this week.

For assistance of the violence-hit people, Kejriwal said the Government has appointed 18 magistrates and four night magistrates.

According to Delhi Fire Services (DFS) data, as many as 79 houses, 52 shops, 2 schools, 3 factories and 4 mosques were burned. The DFS official also noted that 25 calls reported vehicles in flames, and over 500 cars, trucks and busses were gutted. Police said they have received more than 12,000 distress call from Sunday to Thursday.

Outside the GTB Hospital, anxiety escalated as people waited outside the mortuary to receive the bodies of their loved ones. Inside, many people, caught in the communal conflagration that started over the amended citizenship law, battled for live.

Nearly 7,000 paramilitary forces have been deployed in the affected areas since Monday. Hundreds of Delhi Police personnel are also on the ground to maintain peace.

The Union Home Ministry said on Thursday night that no major incident was reported from the northeast district in the past 36 hours. It said prohibitory orders imposed under Section 144 would be relaxed for 10 hours in view of improvement in the situation.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ne-delhi-picks-up-pieces-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/ne-delhi-picks-up-pieces.html
204,29-2-20,Indian mkts lose Rs 5L cr in China virus bloodbath,"From the haunted city of Wuhan to California’s Silicon Valley, and from Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre to the Muslim’s shrines of Mecca and Medina, the deadly coronavirus has spread with such relentless hustle that doomsday forecasters have had a field day in spooking the world. Other than killing close to 3,000 people across four continents, the mysterious pathogen has induced stock market bears to go on a gory bloodbath. On Friday, this mayhem further deepened on bourses across the globe — and India bore the brunt of its fury.

After surviving the outbreak with relatively lesser damage for the last few days, Indian markets caught up with global carnage on Friday. Sensex crashed 1,448.37 points to end at 38,297.29 and Nifty plunged 431.55 points to 11,201.7. It was the biggest single day fall for the two indices in the last one decade. During the week, Sensex plunged 2,872.83 points or 6.97 per cent, and the Nifty tumbled 879.10 or 7.27 per cent.

The market offered no hiding place as traditional safe havens like IT sector, too, crumbled like a house of sand. Infosys, TCS and other IT sectors companies fell by the way side on fear that global travel reduction and spectre of a looming recession could hit the IT spending in the US and elsewhere.

Investors lost more than Rs 5 lakh crore on Friday alone as the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies saw a decline of Rs 12 lakh crore in the last sixth consecutive session of free fall. A massive outflow of by foreign portfolio investors, who have sold equities close to Rs 12,000 crore in one week, has taken away the floor of the market and opened the possibility of a further downside even if there is a technical bounce back in the next week.

As the list of countries hit by the illness grew to 57 with Belarus, Lithuania, New Zealand, Nigeria, Azerbaijan and the Netherlands reporting their first cases, the threats to livelihoods were increasingly eyed as warily as the threats to lives.

A massive sell off of more than 10 per cent on US market, where Down Jones Industrial average fell by 3,000 points over the last five days and warnings by Moody Investor Services of a possible recession have unnerved the investors. The absence of any immediate cure or vaccine to tackle the fast spreading menace has also created an atmosphere of uncertainly and fear.

“The coronavirus has been a body blow to the Chinese economy, which now threatens to take out the entire global economy,” Chief Economist at Moody’s Analytics Mark Zandi has said in a report, adding, “With cases of the new coronavirus disease rising quickly beyond China, the odds of the outbreak turning into a pandemic have now doubled - from 20 per cent to 40 per cent.”

“Our previous assumption that the virus will be contained in China proved optimistic, and the odds of a pandemic are rising,” the report said.

The Moody had earlier forecast a 20 per cent chance of a pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organization as “the worldwide spread of a new disease.”

Another leading economic forecaster -- Oxford Economics -- has said that the coronavirus outbreak could cost the global economy more than $1 trillion in lost output if it turns into a pandemic.

It warned that the global nature of the outbreak would reduce global growth by 1.3 per cent this year, which is equivalent of $1.1trillion in lost income.

The coronavirus especially threatens to derail aviation, tourism and hotel industry. According to International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation sector should brace up for a global revenue loss of $ 30 billion. IATA has also pointed out this would be the first time in a decade that air travel sector could see a degrowth in demand.

Similarly, the coronavirus outbreak could cost the global tourism industry about $80 billion in lost revenue. According to a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), Chinese outbound tourism could take more than one year for recovery, and will cause a global loss of about US$80 billion.

The markets are tanking for two possible reasons. First, coronavirus outbreak is far more serious than the mayhem created by its close cousin SAARS which killed 774 people between 2002 and 2003. Secondly, there is no possible vaccine or cure for the Covid-19 in sight.

The coronavirus has caused four times more casualty and ten times more infection in just two months of its outbreaks. The precautionary shutdown of industry, especially in China, South Korea and many other affected countries, have disrupted the supply chain and threatens to derail the economy of several countries. The freefall in the price of Brent crude is seen as a forerunner a economic slowdown the type of which the world may not have seen for ages.

In a closely-knit global economic scenario, India cannot remain immune to the mayhem, but the long-term prospects seem to be bright for the country. It’s expected that hundreds of American companies which operated from China will migrate to India. It could see the emergence of India as a global manufacturing hub.

But the country will have to find ways to protect its tourism, hotel and aviation sector from collapse if the global situation worsens. The passenger and commercial vehicle sectors have also cause to worry. A supply disruption from China might badly hit automotive component and forging industries in India. China accounts for 27 per cent of India’s automotive component imports.

Globally, Moody’s Investor Service foresees auto sales numbers to go down by 2.5 per cent in 2020 as against the previous estimate of a 0.9 per cent slump.

The country’s pharmaceutical and electronic industries also rely heavily on imports of raw materials from China. They have urged the Government to allow airlifting of essential items to help the industries.

India may have remained free of coronavirus outbreak, but the country will hope and pray that globally the situation will improve in the days and weeks to come. “There is no need to press the panic button yet. The outbreak will be a challenge if issues do not get resolved in three weeks,” said Finance Minister Sitharaman.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indian-mkts-lose-rs-5l-cr-in-china-virus-bloodbath-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/indian-mkts-lose-rs-5l-cr-in-china-virus-bloodbath.html

The area on Friday resembled a ghost town with buildings bearing the brunt of the frenzied mobs led by pro and anti- Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) protesters even as toll rose to 42 after four victims of riots succumbed to injuries in hospitals.

The devastation saw as many as 79 houses, 52 shops, two schools, three factories, four godowns and four mosques being burned. According to the Delhi Fire Service (DFS) officials, there hundreds of calls were received after vehicles were torched.

Over 500 cars, trucks and busses were gutted after being set on fire by the mobs in riot- hit areas. Police said they received more than 12,000 distress calls from Sunday to Thursday.

“An estimated 218 calls of fire incidents were reported in riot-hit North-east Delhi between Monday and Thursday,” said a senior DFS official.

Firefighters faced difficulties to reach locations as even fire tenders were set on blaze by rioters.

“Fire officials were also attacked by the mob and some could reach the spot with help from police,” said the senior DFS official.

“As many as 1,000 trips were made in the entire Northeast district area by our fire vehicles. During the violence, five fire engines were damaged, including one which was completely charred. Some of the firefighters even had to take shelter to save themselves after the vehicles were attacked,” the senior fire official said.

Meanwhile, a senior police official said they are investigating all 123 First Information Reports (FIRs) registered for rioting, looting, violence, arson and firing.

“Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) teams on Friday had visited the spot and samples to ascertain what kinds of chemicals were used by the mobs for arson, have been collected by them,” said the senior police official.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/12k-distress-calls-made--144-properties-gutted.html

Gupta pleaded that his age on the day of the gangrape-murder offence was 16 years and two months as per the school records last attended by him and “the age has not been determined in accordance with the procedures laid down under the Juvenile Justice Act”.

This information was suppressed by the State throughout the proceedings, he claimed.

Gupta is the lone convict who has not exhausted his legal remedy of filing a curative petition — last legal remedy available — and subsequent mercy plea with the President.

The trial court on February 17 issued fresh date for execution of death warrants for March 3 at 6 am for the four convicts — Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) — in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case.

208,29-2-20,SC warns of contempt as lawyers strike on Saturdays for 35 yrs,"Irked by lawyers holding strike every Saturday for 35 years in Uttarakhand district courts over reasons like “bomb blast in Pakistan”, “earthquake in Nepal” or “condolence references for family members”, the Supreme Court on Friday warned advocates of contempt action if they persisted with it.

Holding the strike illegal, the top court sought response from Bar Council of India and all the State Bar Councils within six weeks to suggest the further course of action to deal with the problem of strikes/abstaining from work by the lawyers.

Taking suo motu (on its own) cognisance of the issue, the top court emphasised that at a time when the judiciary is facing serious problem of pendency and delay in disposal of cases, how can the institution as a whole can afford such four days strike in a month.

The SC said that every month on 3-4 Saturdays, the advocates are on strike on one pretext or the other and had the lawyers worked on those days, it would have achieved the ultimate goal of speedy justice, which is now a fundamental right.

A Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and MR Shah said that boycotting courts on every Saturday in the districts of Dehradun, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand is not justifiable at all and as such it tantamount to contempt of the courts.

The Bench dismissed the appeal filed by Dehradun Bar Association challenging the Uttarakhand High Court order of September 25 last year, which asked the lawyers and their associations to withdraw the strike in district courts and warned them of contempt action.

While dismissing the appeal, it said, “The High Court is absolutely justified in issuing the impugned directions. We are in complete agreement with the view expressed by the HC and the ultimate conclusion and the directions issued by the HC.”

It noted the information sent by the High Court to the Law Commission with respect to the State for the years 2012- 2016, which showed that in Dehradun, the advocates were on strike for 455 days (on an average 91 days per year) and in Haridwar district it was 515 days (about 103 days per year). “To go on strike/boycott courts cannot be justified under the guise of the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. Nobody has the right to go on strike/boycott courts. Even, such a right, if any, cannot affect the rights of others and more particularly, the right of Speedy Justice guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21,” it added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-warns-of-contempt-as-lawyers-strike-on-saturdays-for-35-yrs-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sc-warns-of-contempt-as-lawyers-strike-on-saturdays-for-35-yrs.html
209,29-2-20,"PM Modi among special guests invited for Bangladesh centenary, says UK envoy","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is among the special guests invited for the centenary celebrations of Bangladesh founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Dhaka next month because India played an intrinsic role in the country's liberation, according to Bangladesh High Commissioner to the UK Saida Muna Tasneem.

The envoy said the celebrations on March 17, which coincide with the 100th birth anniversary of Sheikh Mujib -- referred to as ""Bangabandhu"" or the father of the Bengali Nation -- will kick off a year-long series of events in Bangladesh as well as the UK.

""Prime Minister Modi is among the special guests invited to the centenary, which also has intrinsic links with Bangabandhu's homecoming in 1971,"" Tasneem told PTI in an interview.

""The roadmap of that journey is that he first stopped in London, where he was officially recognised as the president of the independent state of Bangladesh and had bilateral meetings at 10 Downing Street. Then he was flown to Delhi, where he held a public gathering with (then Indian prime minister) Indira Gandhi,"" she recalled.

The diplomat traced the active role played by Gandhi at the time alongside the then UK prime minister, Edward Heath, to seek Sheikh Mujib's release from Karachi Jail in Pakistan.

""They collectively played a very proactive role in the release of Bangabandhu and to ensure that he was not harmed in any way. So, at the very genesis of Bangladesh, the relationships were clear and the Bangladesh-India ties remain as strong till date, as do the UK-Bangladesh ties,"" she said.

In reference to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which was passed by the Indian Parliament in December last year to grant citizenship rights to persecuted minorities from three neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, the envoy said the implication of the law was ""hurtful"" to Bangladesh.

""The Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, has said it is an internal matter of India but also quite unnecessary. Bengali Hindus in Bangladesh have done very well for themselves, especially in the financial sphere, as they have a particular skill with mathematics and accounts,"" she said.

Amid a recent unrest over the contentious law in Delhi, there have been some calls for Bangladesh to withdraw Modi's invite to the centenary celebrations in Dhaka next month, a demand rejected by the Bangladeshi government.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm-modi-among-special-guests-invited-for-bangladesh-centenary--says-uk-envoy-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/pm-modi-among-special-guests-invited-for-bangladesh-centenary--says-uk-envoy.html

Although, this additional tax would impact all visa categories, it will predominantly create a barrier for people investing in the EB-5 visa programme, the American Bazaar daily said in the report on Friday.

In 2019, the EB-5 investor visa programme, for the first time since the 1990's, increased the minimum investment amount to $900,000.

With this increase in minimum investment, the new 5 per cent additional tax would mean that applicants would have to pay the extra $50,000, when they move money to an escrow account in the US to fulfil their application criterion.

""People seeking to emigrate who do not wish to pay this tax at source and rather account for it later may wish to move their money ahead of the new rules coming into effect.

Although the film lacks a high-powered star cast or commercial value, the trade had expected a start in the range of Rs 4-5 crore, according to the film trade website koimoi.com. Moreover, the website added, there wasn't much competition for ""Thappad"" from the films that were already running, what with both of last week's major releases -- ""Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan"" and ""Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship"" -- seeing slow business overall.

This week, there are eight small films releasing apart from ""Thappad"", but these are too insignificant to make any dent at the box-office. In fact, most of these films have had no publicity and a majority of the audience has not even heard of them. The eight films are -- ""Doordarshan"", ""Guns Of Benaras"", ""O Pushpa I Hate Tears"", ""Kehta Hai Yeh Dil"", ""Haunted Hills"", ""Rizwan"", ""Teen Muhurat"" and ""Cookie"".

The sci-fi horror, ""The Invisible Man"" and the kiddie action comedy ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" were the Hollywood releases of the week. However, these films, too, opened in India without much of a hype.

While of hype, the makers of ""Thappad"" had systematically worked on creating a buzz about the socially relevant and well-crafted film over the past week or so, by screening it for select audiences in Delhi and Mumbai.

The advantage that Sinha's film has it is limited budget, and also the fact that pre-release response has universally been positive about the content as well as the overall acting, particularly of lead star Taapsee.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-thappad--day-one--film-collects-rs-3-07cr-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/-thappad--day-one--film-collects-rs-3-07cr.html

217,29-2-20,F-35 has no chance against a drone fighter plane: Elon Musk,"SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is confident that the traditional warfare era is long over and the future belongs to drone fighter planes that will dominate the sky and F-35 fighter jets will have nowhere to go.

Addressing the gathering at Air Warfare Symposium organised by the US Air Force in Florida on Friday, Musk said the age of fighter jets dominating the sky is over.

""For the air domain... things are definitely going to go into, kind of... locally autonomous drone warfare... is where the future will be... It's not I want the future to be this, this is what the future will be, autonomous drone warfare...,"" The Drive reported Musk as saying.

""Drones locally will be autonomous, but I think we still want to retain the authority to damage or destroy anything that isn't an autonomous drone. Keep the authority back there with a person in the loom. The fighter jet era has passed. It's drones,"" Musk added.

Later, in a tweet, the SpaceX founder said: ""The competitor should be a drone fighter plane that's remote controlled by a human, but with its maneuvers augmented by autonomy. The F-35 would have no chance against it"".

He stressed that F-35 stealth jet ""would have no chance"" against a drone remotely piloted by a human.

The US Air Force successfully tested an advanced, jet-powered drone called the XQ58-A Valkyrie recently that could accompany human-piloted fighter jets on missions.

The autonomous unmanned vehicle, can play a key role in electronic warfare, strike and surveillance on the battlefield.

According to New Atlas, the Valkyrie can carry a small payload of smart bombs, and has a range of just under 2,500 miles. The F-16 Fighting Falcon tops out at just over 2,600 miles while the F-22 Raptor has a range of over 1,800 miles.

Musk also discussed about making a Starfleet real at the symposium.

""How do we make Starfleet real?"" he asked, stressing that reusable launch vehicles are ""absolutely fundamental"" to achieving whatever space ambitions the military might have, including staying ahead of China.

""I think we can go a long way to make Starfleet real and these utopian futures real"".

""The foundation of war is economics. If you have half the resources of the counter-party then you better be real innovative because [otherwise] we're going to loseï¿½ The US will be, militarily, second,"" Musk said.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/f-35-has-no-chance-against-a-drone-fighter-plane--elon-musk-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/f-35-has-no-chance-against-a-drone-fighter-plane--elon-musk.html
218,29-2-20,"NATO chief visits Afghanistan as US, Taliban to sign deal","NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg was in Afghanistan on Saturday for meetings with officials as the United States and the Taliban were to sign a long-sought deal, the alliance said.

Stoltenberg was to participate in a Kabul media conference later Saturday with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the NATO statement said.

He was also to meet the head of the US and NATO forces in the country, General Scott Miller, as well as other commanders of the alliance's training mission there.

The details of the deal, to be signed in Doha on Saturday, have not been disclosed, but it is expected to set the terms of the US to start withdrawing the more than 12,000 troops it has in Afghanistan in return for commitments from the Taliban.

It carries with it hopes of a fall in violence in Afghanistan after decades of conflict and the opening of peace talks with the Afghan government, which was excluded from the direct US-Taliban negotiations.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nato-chief-visits-afghanistan-as-us--taliban-to-sign-deal-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/nato-chief-visits-afghanistan-as-us--taliban-to-sign-deal.html

220,29-2-20,"S Korea reports 813 more coronavirus cases, total 3,150","South Korea confirmed 813 more coronavirus cases on Saturday, the biggest increase to date for the country and taking the national total to 3,150 infections with four additional deaths.

Authorities also reported the country's first case of reinfection -- a 73-year-old woman who tested positive for a second time after her recovery and release from hospital last week.

The illness recurred ""as her immune system had declined"", said Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) official Kwon Jun-wook.

At least 10 reinfection cases have already been reported in China, Kwon added.

More than 90 percent of the new cases were in Daegu, the centre of the country's outbreak, and its neighbouring North Gyeongsang province, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement.

Three women in the Daegu area and one man died of the illness, taking the national toll to 17, the statement added. All were aged in their 60s or older.

The national total is expected to rise further with screening of more than 260,000 people associated with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive entity often accused of being a cult that is linked to around half of the country's cases.

A 61-year-old female member developed a fever on February 10, but attended at least four church services in Daegu -- the country's fourth-largest city with a population of 2.5 million -- before being diagnosed.

Facing public criticism, a Shincheonji spokesman said the church members were victims of a ""witch hunt"".

""I ask you to discard hatred and criticism against our members,"" said the spokesman in a video posted on the Shincheonji website.

More than 85 percent of South Korea's coronavirus cases are in Daegu and the neighbouring province of North Gyeongsang, according to the KCDC.

Of those who test positive for the virus, 80 percent can be treated with medication because they have ""light symptoms"", said vice health minister Kim Gang-lip, adding that the rest would need more advanced treatment in hospitals.

The streets of Daegu have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale.

Authorities have urged the public to exercise caution and anyone with a fever or respiratory symptoms to stay home.

But officials say they are not considering a citywide quarantine similar to the lockdown imposed on the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged.

A surge in confirmed cases has led many events to be cancelled or postponed as the outbreak has hit the world's 12th-largest economy, including concerts by K-pop superstars BTS and the World Team Table Tennis Championships.

The new school term has been delayed by one week nationwide while schools in Daegu by three weeks, and the US and South Korean militaries have postponed forthcoming joint exercises.

222,29-2-20,"US to reduce troops in Afghanistan to 8,600: US officials","The US has committed to make an initial reduction in its forces in Afghanistan to 8,600 as part of its agreement with the Taliban, but there is no obligation for America to withdraw troops if the Afghan parties are unable to reach an agreement, officials said here on Saturday.

As part of its efforts to bring lasting peace in the war-torn Afghanistan and the agreement it signed with the Taliban, the US has committed to make an initial reduction in its forces in Afghanistan to 8,600. The US currently has some 13,000 troops in Afghanistan.

This is the level that General Scotts Miller, Commander of US and NATO troops in Afghanistan, had earlier identified as necessary to fulfil his mission.

The withdrawal of troops and the agreement itself move in parallel processes, a senior administration official said as the US signed an agreement with the Taliban in Doha in presence of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a host of foreign diplomats including those from India.

""Our withdrawal is aligned with this agreement and is conditions-based. If the political settlement fails, if the talks fail, there is nothing that obliges the United States to withdraw troops,"" said the official, who spoke on conditions of anonymity.

""That's not to say that the President doesn't have prerogatives as Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America to make any decision that he feels appropriate as our President, but there is no obligation for the United States to withdraw troops if the Afghan parties are unable to reach agreement or if the Taliban show bad faith in the course of this negotiation,"" the official said.

Responding to questions, the official noted that the withdrawal of troops will not be immediate.

The reduction of troops to 8,600 is part of the initial agreement and it will play out over several months.

""It doesn't happen immediately. It takes a while to get out. It's not going to happen overnight. But that is the commander on the ground's recommendation, that is the President's intention, and that's in the agreement,"" said the official.

According to another senior administration official, America's commitment to act on the drawdown is tied to the Taliban's action on their commitments in the agreement, which include in detail counter terrorism commitments, because that was US' priority concern, but also includes their engagement in these negotiations.

As far as the long-term goal, the President's aspiration remains ultimately to bring a political settlement here, end the war, and end the US military commitment to Afghanistan, the official said.

""The President does not seek a permanent commitment of US forces to a war in Afghanistan. There are a lot of ways that we can and will continue to work with the Afghan Government in the aftermath of a political settlement, and there's many venues of cooperation between us and them, but it is the President's ambition to reach a political settlement and have the United States forces leave and end the fight. That is his goal,"" the official said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-to-reduce-troops-in-afghanistan-to-8-600--us-officials-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-to-reduce-troops-in-afghanistan-to-8-600--us-officials.html

His comments came as the US signed an accord with the Taliban in Doha, laying out a timetable for a full troop withdrawal from Afghanistan within 14 months as it seeks an exit from its longest-ever war.

But on a visit to Kabul, Esper warned that ""should the Taliban fail to honour their commitments they will forfeit their chance to sit with fellow Afghans and deliberate on the future of their country.""

224,29-2-20,Cloud of uncertainty over Olympic Games in Japan,"The fate of world’s biggest sporting event, the Olympic Games, looks uncertain with coronavirus fast spreading across host Japan. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said no decision has been taken on the future of Olympic Games, but Japan has insisted there is no plan to drop the Games, which is scheduled to start on July 24 and run through August 9 in Tokyo.

On Thursday, the WHO said no decision has been made to cancel the major sporting event in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. “To my understanding, no decision has or will be taken in the near term regarding the future of the Olympics,” Dr Mike Ryan, the head of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme told reporters.

A day later on Friday, news agency Reuter quoted an official from Japan saying, Tokyo has no Plan B for this year’s Summer Olympics despite alarm over the spread of the coronavirus. “There will not be one bit of change in holding the Games as planned,” Katsura Enyo, deputy director general of the Tokyo 2020 Preparation Bureau at the city Government, told Reuters.

The number of coronavirus cases refuses to decline in Japan -- with over 186 cases of infection and five deaths and has already announced closure of all its schools for several weeks. Japan has become the second country after China to close all schools in the face of the outbreak. The total number of confirmed cases globally has reached more than 83,000, with at least 2,869 deaths.

Japanese officials might be posing bold face, but if the outbreak continued unabated there is little hope that the Olympic Games could take place as scheduled.

The virus has entered into a new alarming scenario in some nations like the US and Germany where cases of contracted pathogen are being reported with no clues as to where it came from.

This poses threat to the densely populated countries like India which has so far kept the deadly virus at bay. Indian authorities have been screening travelers at airports, seaports and border crossings. As a preventive measure to strengthen its response to combat the outbreak, if any, India on Friday announced holding a series of training sessions of trainers at the Central and State level from next month.

Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary (Health Ministry) in a letter written on Friday to the States asked to ensure surveillance, infection prevention and control.

The three persons confirmed with the infection, all in Kerala, have been discharged from hospital.

However, a new crisis lurks on the Iranian front with Indian nationals complaining of large scale cancellation of air tickets after India restricted entry of Iranian airlines into India.

Iran has reported over 26 deaths, the highest outside China. The first cases in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Estonia involved people who had been in Iran.

In fact, with virus spreading to more than 50 nations, the WHO has already cautioned that the international spread of the COVID-19 showed it had “pandemic potential.”",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cloud-of-uncertainty-over-olympic-games-in-japan-2020-02-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/cloud-of-uncertainty-over-olympic-games-in-japan.html
