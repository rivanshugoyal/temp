0,09-4-20,Just a ‘small thing’,"Despite all the propaganda trotted out by Beijing, some scars may remain for decades, bringing the most drastic changes to China’s image in the world

Moustapha Dahleb, the Chadian doctor and author, gave one of the most touching descriptions of COVID-19, the pandemic that is presently plaguing the earth. In his blog titled, “Humanity Shaken by a Small Thing (Un Petit Machin)”, he argues, “A small microscopic thing called coronavirus is upsetting the planet. Something invisible has come to make its law. It questions everything and upsets the established order. Everything is put back in place, otherwise, differently.”

Among other collaterals, “the Small Thing” has triggered two wars on a scale not seen since World War II and the subsequent Cold War between the Western and Soviet blocks. The first war is against the “Small Thing” itself as to how to stop its worldwide spread and find a vaccine. China and the US, the world’s two super powers, are competing to win the battle. In China, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has been working harder than anybody to find a solution. Is it because the PLA was no stranger to the first spread of the virus? It may take years or even decades to know the truth. Meanwhile, as early as January 26, a 54-year-old PLA General, Chen Wei, headed to Wuhan “to fight the epidemic” and take over the civilian Wuhan Institute of Virology (partially funded by France).

Further on March 16, China announced that the lady General had developed a vaccine for the Coronavirus and it had entered the first stage for clinical trials. According to Chinascope, a Chinese website based in the US, it is the first recombinant Coronavirus vaccine (adenovirus vector) approved for clinical trial. Volunteers, organised in three groups with 36 people in each, were given injections; Gen Chen was the first to be injected. The Global Times called Chen “a real pathfinder.” Before taking charge of the Wuhan lab, Chen was associated with the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS).

It was, however, pointed out that it would have taken at least five months to develop the recombinant vaccine approved today by Beijing. Chinascope explained, “The US has also developed a vaccine in a short period but it was based on a different technology (mRNA technology), which could take about 40 days to do. The traditional recombinant vaccine could provide a permanent cure but the mRNA vaccine is like a flu shot that needs to be done every year.” The question, therefore, is, when did the PLA start developing the vaccine to be able to complete the research in five months? Did China know about the “Small Thing” earlier than announced (end of December)? It’s difficult to answer this question but China will probably win the first war.

The second war triggered by the “Small Thing” is to do with information warfare, though this isn’t new. The US website, War on the Rocks, explained, “Several countries are employing disinformation and messaging campaigns around COVID-19 in a branding effort to ensure they are not blamed for the pandemic in the history books.”

For the Communist Party of China (CPC), it is a question of life and death. War of the Rocks asserted: “As the number of COVID-19 cases in China has reportedly declined, Chinese State-run media and diplomats have waged a disinformation campaign against the US in an attempt to distract from Beijing’s mismanagement of the crisis.”

It cites historical examples from the Soviet era, when the same tactics were used, attempting to bring a new narrative: “The origin of the virus is unknown. It could have come from anywhere in the world. China has been a model in handling the sensitive issue. Beijing can now advise the world how to go about it.”

Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, started to use vitriolic Twitter attacks against critics of his country. He alleged that the American military was at the origin of the virus. The argument went so far that China’s Ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, had to contradict his spokesperson. Cui said that it was “crazy” to spread rumors about the Coronavirus originating from a military laboratory in the US.

China may lose the second war. In a few months or years, the “Small Thing” will have eventually dissolved or disappeared (it has already to a great extent in China if one is to believe the Chinese propaganda) but some scars may remain for decades, bringing the most drastic changes to China’s image in the world.

Take Italy, they trusted Chinese President Xi Jinping and agreed to participate in his Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As a the result, more than three lakh Chinese came to work in Northern Italy, where the tragedy started. Then the case of Holland; the Dutch Health Ministry announced it had recalled 600,000 face masks from China. Ditto was the case for Spain. Its Government encountered similar problems with testing kits ordered from a Chinese company and withdrew a batch of rapid test kits manufactured by China. Turkey and the Czech Republic also announced that they had found some testing kits, ordered from Chinese companies, were not sufficiently accurate.

Examples could be multiplied. China imported about 2.5 billion healthcare items, including visors, masks, gloves and ventilators from Australia between January 24 and February 29, leaving Australian frontline medical staff without protective equipment when the virus struck that country. Masks and other items have to be bought back at often highly inflated prices.

Critics have also accused Beijing of trying to split the European Union (EU) by shipping equipment to certain nations on more favourable terms than others, while leaving the US, the present epicenter of the pandemic, in the lurch. This scar will remain for a long time despite Beijing’s all-out propaganda. Eventually, Xi will have to answer some hard questions from those in Beijing, who were or are in favour of a softer and more human approach to other nations in difficulty.

But the most valuable lesson of the “Small Thing’s” strike is well described by Moustapha Dahleb: “Suddenly the pollution has dropped, people have started having time, so much time that they don’t even know what to do with it. Parents get to know their children, kids learn to stay with their families, work is no longer a priority, travel and leisure are no longer the norm for a successful life. Suddenly, in silence, we turn around in ourselves and understand the value of the words solidarity and vulnerability. Suddenly we realise that we are all on the same boat, rich and poor.”

Let us hope that the “Small Thing” can bring more humanity to this planet despite the high price paid by all nations.

1,09-4-20,Getting flying again,"The IATA is estimating that over 25 million aviation sector jobs could be lost globally as a result of the pandemic

It was the golden age of aviation when flights connected cities like Delhi to the unlikeliest of places on the planet. Thanks to the latest generation of fuel-efficient aircraft with smaller passenger loads as well as travellers, who were keen to explore new destinations, cities across the world saw air travel explode over the past decade. But the spread of COVID-19 pandemic has brought all this to a screeching halt. In fact, had growth come to a standstill, the sector would have dealt with it. But what has happened now as a result of the pandemic is even worse. As nations across the world shut both their external and internal borders, passenger flights have come to a virtual standstill. With only vital cargo flights and the occasional repatriation ones operating, commercial air travel has declined, almost overnight, by over three quarters. This is a sort of shock that the aviation industry will find it difficult to recover from. A report by the airline industry body, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), has estimated that airlines across the world will have to lay off over 25 million people if Governments do not intervene, adding that about a third of 2.7 million direct jobs in the airline sector had either been lost or were furloughed. The industry’s representative body also said that airline finances were so fragile, they could not afford to refund customers. Other reports have come out estimating that the industry will lose upwards of $35 billion this year. All such reports leave little doubt that when the world does emerge from the crisis, global aviation will not be the same again. That said, with much air travel being dependent on passenger confidence and that likely to remain extremely low in the aftermath of the pandemic, passenger numbers could take two-three years to recover. And that is if the world is not tipped into a recession, which could make the entire decade a lost one for the industry.

In India, not only have airlines announced pay cuts across the board, stories are emerging that some have furloughed their latest hires, leaving hundreds of newly-hired cabin attendants stuck far from home and without money. All thanks to the lockdown, they are unable to get back home. The aviation sector had been a rare beacon of hope for the Indian economy, creating both jobs and wealth. Yet, as of today, airlines are as clueless as an average Indian as to when the lockdown will be lifted and when they can get flying again. With restrictions on travel likely and several nations unlikely to open up their borders until May at the earliest, getting even a limited schedule going might be extremely complicated with the current staff numbers. There are likely to be hundreds of job losses at airlines and some suspect that one or even two firms in India might not survive the crisis. But the knock-on impact to the economy and jobs will not be restricted to the airlines alone. Across the world, almost a quarter of application-based taxi services such as Uber and Ola survive on airport pick-ups and drop-offs. A decline in airport traffic, therefore, will hit that sector, too. Even at airports, lower passenger numbers will mean less retail and security staff. The indirect job losses in the country alone can be in millions. And with no social security net, this will put huge economic pressure on families. The Government will not be able to do much to influence the sentiment on the flying Indian public and across the world. But it should not leave the millions of those unemployed, directly or indirectly, in the lurch.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/getting-flying-again-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/getting-flying-again.html
2,09-4-20,Sliver of hope,"While drug combos are being used to slow down the spread, plasma transfusion from recovered patients is another option

With a possible vaccine still months away, there’s a glimmer of hope. Apparently, a temporary measure touted to be a “promising rescue option” is being explored to treat critically ill patients, our frontline healthcare workers and those at high risk. Researchers have found tentative evidence in a century-old blood transmission treatment that may help us at least slow the spread of the disease. The process involves the infusion of blood plasma cells, collected from patients who have recovered from the disease, to those critically ill. What this reliable stopgap measure does is that it buys enough time for the patients to stabilise and recover. The antibodies so injected into the patient’s body act as a booster, thus increasing his/her immunity, which helps the body to be better prepared to be exposed to the impacts of SARS-CoV-2. China has already made use of this plasma therapy with five critically ill patients, including women, all aged between 35-65, showing striking improvements. In the US, too, trials on two patients were conducted and now, the New York Blood Center is collecting blood plasma donations from convalescent COVID-19 patients for therapeutic use in New York City, the new epicentre of the pandemic. Depending on the test results, which would depend on three parameters, namely whether the plasma can prevent infection in COVID-19 patients by a close contact; can keep people with moderate symptoms from needing intensive care; and can it help cure those critically ill, the FDA would give a further green signal for wider use. In the UK, too, the national blood service has started screening blood from patients to find plasma rich in antibodies to use in those trials. Thankfully, India does have facilities to derive plasma from blood cells but is yet to receive a heads up from the Drug Controller General of India. Much will depend on the experiments carried out in these nations. Though there’s enough evidence for it to be used for treatments but for the lack of any definitive answers, it is being used for emergency cases only.

While we await a conclusive result, it is some relief to know that this method, also known as convalescent plasma/sera, is known to have worked wonders in curing past epidemics such as mumps and measles. Even COVID-19’s foremost predecessor like H1N1, Ebola and SARS were fought with this passive immune therapy, though with inconsistent success. What is learnt from these experiences is the fact that downsides, too, exist. Some patients could recover, others could not. This is why the therapy is being treated as “experimental” and is being used for “emergency” cases only. Primarily, it runs the risk of transmitting other kinds of diseases to the patient which might aggravate matters. Besides, with the antibodies present in donors varying, a process to pool in concentrated and consistent dose will need to be developed. It is, however, soothing that the process makes use of everyday equipment that is normally found in hospitals and blood-bank facilities. What will be troublesome is for nations to find convalescents eligible for plasma donation. For doctors, it would be essential to find the right kind of plasma, one that has the highest concentration of neutralising antibodies. Nevertheless, until a long-term strategy is found, we can at least buy time for COVID-affected patients.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sliver-of-hope-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/sliver-of-hope.html
3,09-4-20,Power workers demand insurance cover,"



|

Lauding the Yogi Adityanath government for extending insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh to police personnel and Health department staff, Power Employees Joint Action Committee demanded similar favour for them.

It argued that power employees also worked in adverse and risky environment and they should also be given insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh.

Power Employees Joint Action Committee convenor Shailendra Dubey said on Wednesday that power employees at the time of coronavirus pandemic were vulnerable to risks and for maintaining their morale, they should also be given insurance cover.

Dubey said that like the police, health and sanitation employees, power employees were also working round-the-clock for maintaining power supply in the state by managing power generation, transmission and distribution.

The JAC leader said that on April 5, the appeal to people by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to switch off lights for 9 minutes caused a huge slump of over 31,000 MW in power demand. He said that despite the unprecedented drop in demand, power employees ensured smooth operation of the grid and uninterrupted power supply, which was a tough task.

On Wednesday, the UP government announced insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh for police personnel in the state. A formal order is likely to be issued soon.

Earlier, Punjab government had announced to provide additional health insurance of Rs 50 lakh to policemen and sanitation workers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/power-workers-demand-insurance-cover.html

8,09-4-20,"UP scraps LAD fund for current fiscal, cuts lawmakers’ salary","



|

With the aim to arrange funds to fight the coronavirus pandemic, the Uttar Pradesh government decided to scrap the Local Area Development Fund of legislators for the current fiscal and also announced a cut of 30 per cent of salaries of legislators and ministers.

This and other decisions were taken at a cabinet meeting held through video-conferencing in Lucknow on Wednesday.

A government spokesman said that in the brief meeting through video-conferencing, ministers unanimously approved Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s suggestion to suspend Local Area Development Fund for 2020-21 fiscal. The fund will be diverted to chief minister’s Covid Care Fund.

Besides, the cabinet also decided to slash salaries of ministers and legislators by 30 per cent.

Legislators of the state get Rs 3 crore per year as Local Area Development Fund, commonly known as Vidhayak Nidhi.

The chief minister said the fund collected through this would be used for improving infrastructure of testing labs, COVID hospitals and also for manufacturing personal protection equipment (PPE), N95 masks and ventilators.

Already a dozen Bharatiya Janata Party lawmakers, including some ministers, have pledged their contribution that includes Local Area Development Fund and a year’s salary for the Covid Care Fund.

The official said that after the cabinet approval, the government would bring an ordinance in this regard through which money would be transferred to the Covid Care Fund.

The UP cabinet also approved a change in the contingency which was earlier Rs 600 crore and now has been doubled to Rs 1,200 crore.

On Monday, the Centre had brought an ordinance to cut the salary of Union ministers and MPs and suspended MPLAD fund for two years.

Sources said that before taking this decision, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath brought opposition parties on the same page and spoke to Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav, SP president Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati.

The opposition gave its consent with a rider that the entire transaction be made in a transparent way and the government make public the expenditure done for the prevention of COVID-19 virus in the state through this fund.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-scraps-lad-fund-for-current-fiscal--cuts-lawmakers----salary.html

10,09-4-20,Not making a song and dance...,"...but the cultural and creative sectors need financial help, too, as they have been ravaged by the impact of stringent public health measures imposed by the Govt to stem the pandemic

The cultural and creative sectors across the world have been ravaged by the impact of stringent public health measures, with performances and arts festivals cancelled, theatres, museums and cinemas closed and film and television production halted. The list, sadly, goes on. For the unorganised arts sector in India, the impact is worse than ruinous. In times of crises, artistes are often among those most affected. In addition to health concerns, this is a challenging time for many in our community as we deal with cancelled incomes, investments made for booking venues, paid advances to technical and other staff that cannot be recovered, cancellation of teaching and other such activities. In addition, trying to make plans for future dates for performances and festivals, resuming teaching and choreographic activities, while sustaining one’s creative inspiration, in these very uncertain times is very unnerving.

March has already had a devastating economic impact on India’s non-profit arts sector. Since the first State-level orders of cancelling all events, sports activities, anything that meant an audience or congregation, in early March, nixing of several scheduled events, festivals and performances has been reported across the length and breadth of the country. Many freelancers have seen their livelihoods disappear overnight. We are entering a period of unprecedented isolation and worry for people in the field of culture, be they artistes, stage workers, technicians or other workforce that come under the category of self-employed people.

As we know already, dancers, musicians, painters, sculptors and others involved in artistic pursuits are vulnerable and suffer from insecurities that come with the territory. The situation is unique and heartbreaking, because there are so many implications for everybody and there will be a domino effect on all those connected with the arts sector. Artistes are crying out for help from the Government in a bid to seek revalidation and have resonance.

As COVID-19 continues to spread across India, both Union and State Ministries of culture should sustain this sector as best as they can, so that artistes and organisations can continue to nourish the imagination of people across the country, both during the crisis and in the period of recovery.

Recognising that in the current pandemic, artistes as independent workers, arts organisations dependent on gathering groups together and creative people engaged in travel and exchange are especially affected, both Union Ministries of Culture and Tourism and State Governments should be proactive. They should be committed to creating, amplifying and sharing resources to support artistes and communities, always as part of their mission and at this time especially.

It is hard to understand why there has been a stony silence from the Culture Ministry. It’s almost as if we do not exist for them and/or, if we do, they do not care about the welfare of the sector they are mandated to be working for.

The Ministry should stand with the cultural and creative sector in these difficult times. Their duty is to do everything they can to mobilise further support from the Finance Ministry for these critical sectors.

While I welcome the Prime Minister’s Office’s and the Finance Ministry’s swift responses to aid and change rules to support a huge majority of Jan Dhan account holders, migrant labour, daily wagers, struggling businesses, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), deferred payment of EMIs, deferred filing of Goods and Service Tax (GST), claiming refund on taxes and so on, I, once again, appeal to them, to understand that cultural and creative businesses are also struggling and they need financial support now.

Our country is generally recognised as the arts and spiritual capital of the world. Our responsibility is to nurture and nourish our artistic heritage and deep-rooted culture and traditions and we can do this, at this time of crisis, only by valuing and preserving our living artistes, performers, teachers the cultural workforce and to give them assurances and hope that the Government stands with them to ensure that there is a semblance of stability and security in their lives until life reboots to “normal.”

The following remedial measures for the arts and culture sector can be considered by the Government. Set up a culture relief fund recognising that artistes and cultural workers exist within precarious work and employment conditions, often as self-employed or contract workers.

They are also the driving force of our artistic and cultural sector and the broader creative economy. The Government must also direct some of the Corporate Social Responsibility monies towards the culture relief fund and ensure that dedicated funding is available to the arts and culture sector as part of the recovery plan.

Artistes and culture workers, who have been hit hard by lack of earnings, could be given a basic minimum payment to sustain themselves for these three-four months.

Artistes, culture workers and non-profit organisations must be given the option of deferred filing of taxes until January 2021, reclaiming of Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) on fixed deposits and savings that they may have, deferred payments of rentals, deferred filing of TDS, GST(as the case maybe), electricity and such overhead costs incurred for maintenance of culture spaces that cannot operate for three-four months.

Plus, grants already approved for non-profits for organising conferences and festivals or individual events and programmes must be made available to such organisations by relaxing compliances until things slowly return to normal.

Those non-profit organisations that have been unable to conduct events, conferences, or performances due to the outbreak of COVID-19 should be permitted to utilise the funds for other activities that they may decide to conduct in future as per the timelines and curation, without imposing restrictions of compliances to a said financial year.

Artistes and culture workers should also be given health security for themselves and their families, should any be affected by the current pandemic.

Non-profits currently availing of repertory grant and salary grant be given funds to reimburse salaries of dancers, musicians and culture workers, who have not come for rehearsals because of the lockdown and to maintain the number of artistes and others on their payroll, so they are secure and can continue artistic pursuits.

Also, 20 per cent of the grants that they were given in the last two years, should be given to non-profits working in culture as “sustenance or maintenance fund”, for any of these factors that determine their situation: Employees who stopped working due to COVID-19 and do not have access to paid leave or other income support. Workers who are sick, quarantined, or taking care of someone who is sick with COVID-19. Staff who must stay home without pay to care for children that are sick or need additional care. Employees who still have their employment but are not being paid because there is currently not enough work and there is uncertainty of work in future.

Non-profit organisations understandably cannot continue to retain and pay staff salaries because of the uncertainty of funding and future work that will be available.

Many countries that have experienced the severe impact of Covid-19 have doled out benefits to the arts and culture sector, recognising its importance and valuing its contribution in upholding the creative strength of their nations.

It is time for India to act, too, and give some tangible benefits to the arts and culture sector that is engaged in propagating the intangible heritage of our country.

Creative capital has always been anchored by a rich spirit of community and mutual generosity and I hope that CSR for culture becomes mandatory to reboot the sector. Without sufficient funds, creativity and creation of works of dance, music, painting, sculpture and others will suffer. Therefore, continuing communication and exchange are crucial for all of us.

11,09-4-20,Strengthen their hands to save us,"All nations must invest in nursing and midwifery education and employment to improve health systems and advance gender equity

Nurses and midwives are central to the delivery of quality primary health services for all. Nurses are highly effective in delivering services that prevent illness, promote health and care for the physically and mentally-ill and people with disabilities. The global response to COVID-19 underscores how critical nurses are to health security. They must be supported to get the job done. On their part, midwives provide the essential care needed for every woman to have a positive childbirth experience, for every child to come into the world safely and for every newborn and child to avoid disease and death.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) is committed to strengthening its nursing and midwifery workforce as part of its quest to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). UHC is one of eight flagship priorities in the South-East Asia Region and the target that underpins Sustainable Development Goal Three, the health goal. In 2015 the region embarked on its decade for health workforce strengthening — a key initiative aimed at overcoming shortages and skill-gaps in health cadre across the region. By 2018 the region had increased the density of nurses and midwives to 18 per 10,000 population, up from 16 per 10,000 in 2014. In 2018 the global average density was 37 per 10,000 population. The minimum should be 40.

By 2030 the region will require as many as 1.9 million more nurses and midwives. Special focus must be given to ensuring that they are deployed where they are needed most — rural and hard-to-reach areas. At every opportunity, policymakers and administrators should empower female health workers to reach leadership roles and to be involved in decision-making. All of them must be paid fairly.

As the world marks the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife, we must celebrate, support and strengthen this workforce, with a focus on several key areas.

The first step is strengthening education. Demographic changes are shifting healthcare needs and driving greater demand for services for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), care for older people and the terminally-ill. For healthcare workers to respond to these needs, policymakers and administrators must review pre-service education, including curriculum and faculty development and where necessary, amend it. They should ensure all nurses and midwives are provided ongoing professional development opportunities, including in-service training, to enhance their knowledge and skills.Tomorrow’s challenges may be different from today’s.

Second, the policymakers and administrators should ensure that the work environment for healthcare professionals is safe, healthy and satisfying. The hours nurses and midwives work should be reasonable and aligned with national labour laws. The on-the-job hazards they are exposed to should be minimised and wherever possible, eliminated. They should never be subjected to violence. By providing a positive and enabling environment for them, policymakers and administrators will increase recruitment, retention and motivation. This is particularly important as countries enhance the quality of health services in remote and hard-to-reach areas.

Third, increased focus should be put on strengthening leadership and management. Evidence shows that countries that have a chief nursing officer and a nursing leadership programme have stronger regulatory environment for nursing and midwifery. This helps them to ensure that all healthcare providers have adequate capacity and skills and can work effectively in interdisciplinary teams. It also means that, when developing policy, they are more likely to benefit from the knowledge and experience these healthcare workers have. Hence, they must be enabled to develop leadership potential and participate in key decision-making forums.

Additional investments are needed. The first-ever State of the World’s Nursing Report shows that low and middle-income countries should invest an additional $10 per capita for nursing education alone. In most countries, this can be achieved with domestic funds. In some countries, development partners and financing institutions can help. By transferring human capital investments for education, employment, gender and other areas into national health workforce strategies, partners can strengthen the workforce while driving job creation, gender equity and youth engagement.

The WHO is committed to supporting all countries in the region to strengthen their nursing and midwifery workforce as together we pursue our overarching goal: UHC. Health for all at all ages is possible. We can and we must, make it happen.

12,09-4-20,Policy choices in the times of Coronavirus,"The country is facing the worst crisis in modern times and it would need to follow a structured approach to overcome it. Extraordinary times require extraordinary solutions and the State should step aside from the playbook to make them possible

The COVID-19 crisis is a bolt from the blue. There is no precedent of this particular strain of the Coronavirus and hence, any projections of its impact can just be intelligent guesses. Predictive numbers need to be relied upon with great caution. One has to keep a very close watch on how the crisis unfolds and keep tinkering with different actions as facts regarding the virus’ trajectory, the effectiveness or otherwise of containment efforts and reactions of economic actors become clearer. The crisis would, as any crisis does, affect both the supply and demand sides of the economy. It would stress not only the financial markets but the socio-economic fabric of society.

The country has been put under a 21-day nationwide lockdown and while social distancing is necessary to prevent the rapid spread of the epidemic, there is a huge economic cost that it entails.There is no denying the fact that the choice seemed to be between the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and lives. However, sooner than later, questions regarding rising unemployment, shutting down of businesses, increasing non-performing assets, supply chain disruptions, reduced investments and contracting demand would become serious challenges. The sooner we reframe the choice from being between the GDP and lives to being between lives and lives, the better we would be able to manage the crisis.

While this may seem to be the right time to undertake structural reforms that may help build long-term resilience to such crises in the future, our prime concern has to the revival of the economy in the present. To the extent possible, we should only focus on the short-term for the moment, while trying to ensure that these short-term measures are aligned with the needed long-term structural changes.The responses for every sector would have to be classified into short-term (two-three months) focussed clearly on defeating the onslaught of the pandemic; medium-term (three to eight months) focussed on socio-economic revival; long-term (eight months onwards) focussing on pushing ahead on all cylinders based on new emergent realities.

In the short-term, flattening the curve of the epidemic below levels of available capacity in terms of hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds is a top priority and a mere lockdown won’t be enough to achieve that. A lockdown is not sustainable beyond a point as people will start to decide between a thin chance of dying from the virus and an almost certain chance of starving to death.The smartest ways of leveraging the lockdown lie in the world of data. If a rapid testing methodology (NAT or equivalent) can be deployed at a large scale that enables quick tests, then a sampling methodology can ensure that the working population can be screened as per need. And, if needed, quarantined and then treated so as to allow them to get back to work as quickly as possible. The tests should not only be free but also freely available.

The country will have to be very creative with the generation of resources. Fiscal deficit goals could be shelved for at least the next six months. Fiscal action needs to be directly focussed on providing relief to individuals and firms most affected by the crisis and not on public spending on the creation of economic assets like highways and sewage systems.The actions would include, inter-alia, ways of ensuring people remain on payrolls or else are provided unemployment allowance and so on. The crisis-hit manufacturing sector needs to be supported through special loans, restructuring and rescheduling of loans, Goods and Services Tax (GST) breaks, tax incentives, altered insurance premiums, especially in the case of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). After individuals and firms, banks need to be supported. The Government can look at a law against layoffs during the crisis period. The role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in this context will be crucial.

In the medium term, the focus has to be on rapid economic revival.The recently-announced Rs 1.7 lakh crore crisis-management package by the Government, which accounts for around one per cent of the GDP may need to be scaled up to around five-six percent, considering the magnitude of the crisis. Within that package, resources would have to be found to support sectors most severely impacted by the crisis through incentives, moratoriums and easy availability of credit.

Also, investments into the expansion of the healthcare system would need to be continued with a significant emphasis on the development/sourcing of a vaccine to deal with the outbreak. Collaboration with international agencies and being nestled in global efforts in this direction would be immensely important. States are playing the most critical role at the forefront of dealing with the crisis but face constraints in using resources as their hands are tied with laws like the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003. It is time that these restraints are relaxed for the current financial year so that they can ramp up testing infrastructure, health facilities and buying of vaccines as per their need.

Revving up the economic engine, in the long run, would need more than liquidity, doles and incentives. The country can use this opportunity to carry out structural reforms. A society with unequal levels of ownership of capital and unequal access to basic services like health and education would see an exacerbation of such differences as it attempts to push frontiers of economic growth. Therefore, the first step should be towards land reforms.

In a country where more than 70 per cent farmers have less than two hectares of land and almost 40 per cent of the workforce in agriculture is landless, no amount of support services can provide the foundation for sustainable uplift from a state of perennial crisis. There is a need for actual redistribution of land between the haves and the have-nots. The political economy has to bite this bullet before it is too late.

The Government’s aspirations towards becoming a $5 trillion economy are laudable. There are many priorities, programmes and policies currently. In the absence of harmonisation among them, different actors in the economic system work towards different goalposts in a fragmented and inefficient manner, sub-optimally addressing the national imperative.

The importance of decentralisation in solving problems in an agile manner cannot be exaggerated. Economic growth has to be a key objective of local governments. An integrated Ministry for Economic Growth, both at the Centre and State levels, could be examined to support local efforts and to bring convergence between the functions of industrial policy, urbanisation, regional development and economic growth through the “whole of Government” approach.

The country is facing the worst crisis in modern times and it would need to follow a structured approach to overcome it. Extraordinary times require extraordinary solutions and the State should step aside from the playbook to make them possible.

14,09-4-20,Rizvi for exacting reparation from Jamaat members,"



|



Uttar Pradesh Shia Central Waqf Board chairman Waseem Rizvi demanded that members of Tablighi Jamaat be forced to make financial reparation for spreading coronavirus across India and a criminal case be registered against Jamaat chief Maulana Mohammad Saad Kandhalvi for spreading the virus.

He also demanded that those who died from COVID-19 be cremated irrespective of caste and religion.

Rizvi said, “It is time to rise above narrow considerations of caste and religion. The bodies of COVID-19 victims be cremated and if the person happens to be Muslim then the ashes be handed over to the family for burial in a graveyard as per Islamic traditions. If the body is buried it could further spread infection and also pollute the land.”

The Shia Waqf Board official said that he had obtained a fatwa from 93-year-old Ayatollah Nasir Makrim of Iran, who ruled that any person responsible for spreading the disease would have to pay the cost.

“The fatwa says that if that person dies from the disease, then he will be held responsible,” he said.

“Even as India is fighting spread of coronavirus, it is spreading like wildfire due to religious congregation at Jamaat markaz in Delhi. As per Shariat law and Indian law, Jamaat chief Maulana Saad is solely responsible for spreading the disease and the entire cost of containing the epidemic be realised from him,” Rizvi said in a statement issued in Lucknow on Wednesday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rizvi-for-exacting-reparation-from-jamaat-members.html

Both the nurses vacated their rented house and shifted to another place, he said.

""People might suspect infection but this fear should not lock down humanity and lead to eviction of persons providing yeoman service like nursing,"" Bagchi said.

22,09-4-20,Ayurveda can boost immune system to fight corona,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no medicine or vaccine for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

The medical science also makes it clear that there is no medicine in allopathy and homoeopathy.

However, Ayurveda has measures to boost human body immune system which may help minimize the impact of corona.

The Ayurvedic herbs like tulsi, cinnamon, black pepper, shunthi (dry ginger) and raisins and regular yoga are potent aids to increase the body's immunity against harmful viruses.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has also suggested people to ""have a look"" at Ayush Ministry's protocol to stay fit.

Consuming warm water, practising yogasana, pranayama and meditation for 30 minutes every day will help boost immune system, the ministry protocol said to build a strong immune system.

This apart, using turmeric, cumin, coriander and garlic in cooking, besides taking 10 gm of chyavanprash in the morning will help to keep one healthy along with jaggery and fresh lemon juice.

These local products can be helpful in the fight against COVID-19.

The immunity enhancer available in the market like herbal drug Fifatrol, a multi-drug combination of Ayurvedic classical medicines and herbs like mrityunjay rasa, sanjeevani vati, tulsi and giloe may help.

These herbs also help increase the production of interferons (proteins) and antibodies to generate immune response against viruses and increase the rate of phagocytises to destroy microorganisms, thus, increasing immunity from containing viral infections, a former CSIR scientist said.

The idea is that if you don't have a potent weapon to combat the enemy, a strong and effective shield is the best bet to protect yourself.

The Ministry of Aayush has also recommended 150 ml hot milk with half teaspoon of turmeric powder once or twice a day, application of sesame oil/coconut oil or ghee in both the nostrils in the morning and evening.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ayurveda-can-boost-immune-system-to-fight-corona.html
23,09-4-20,COVID-19 set to hit State's economy hard,"As the Corona virus disease (COVID-19) continues to wreak havoc on markets across the world, the pandemic will no doubt have a huge adverse impact on the economy of Odisha in days to come.

The virus is all set to break the backbone of a number of sectors that bring core revenue to the State and thereby push Odisha further into economic doldrums.

Even when the State administration is facing a tough time in fighting the virus, the battle on the economic front is going to be tougher, feel experts.

From agriculture, mining and tourism to exports, entertainment, electronics and information technology – all these revenue-yielding sectors have been crippled by the outbreak.

While the 24 days’ lockdown the State has faced since March 21 has literally shut down all forms of trade and commerce, the long term implication of the lockdown and the unpredictable time frame of the virus will hurt the entire economy, experts opined.

The aim of the State administration has been to flatten the curve of the COVID-19, but the impact on the economy may perhaps go beyond the State’s mitigation efforts.

Mining, tourism and exports sectors are near ‘zero’ at the moment and with markets closed local small businesses will be hit really hard in the coming days and months. All are waiting to see the real impacts on a range of sectors in the next few months.

At the moment one can only predict, and the predictions are really bad. Experts expect any sort of revival in any sector may take at least 12 to 18 months post-Corona control.

Mining sector used to be the largest contributor to the State exchequer and now with 23 major iron ore manganese mines gone to new hands, it will take at least one year for resumption of mining operations.

Second, though mining activities are kept out of the purview of lockdown, non-availability of manpower has almost stalled operations.

“Hospitality industry has been devastated completely. While Corona virus has brought this sector to a standstill position, there is no hope that tourism will revive anytime soon, simply because even after everything settles down, people are not going to travel anytime soon,” said a leading tour operator.

With big hotels across the State including the ones owned by the Odisha Tourism Development Corporation (OTDC), a State-owned PSU pulling down shutters, the condition of the smaller hotels is obvious.

FICCI Eastern Region Tourism Committee Chairman Souvagya Mohapatra said, “We have asked the State Government to bail out the industry. Hopefully, we will see something coming up.”

Agriculture, which is the mainstay of Odisha, is badly hurt. Rabi crop harvest has come to a standstill due to non availability of workers. Allied sectors are also facing the toughest time. Take for example, every day 30 lakh litres of milk are wasted and milk farmers are in dire straits.

Similarly, fisheries sector is facing a tough time and worse is the situation of the sea food exports. Odisha is one of the major seafood exporters in the country but since Corona virus has hit the State the fishermen have hardly gone out for fishing, forget exporting the catch.

There is hardly any fishing happening now. But more than that, all our markets have been hit terribly. The US, China, Europe and Japan are the core markets, where Odisha used to send mainly shrimps. Corona has shut down everything.

Official stats say that seafood exports from the country and shrimp export to China alone had touched a record growth of 42 percent in 2019. But COVID-19 has turned everything upside down, said a senior official of Falcon Exports, which is the biggest exporter of sea food from Odisha.

COVID-19 simply does not seem to spare anyone. Another big sector that has taken a hit is Electronics and Information Technology (E andIT).

While most of the big companies like Infosys, TCS, and other IT companies in Odisha have given permission to their employees to work from home, a model which would help the companies cut costs, the sector will face a serious crisis in coming days, admitted experts.

With the State Government shutting down bars and beverage outlets, the other big revenue generating arm of Odisha Excise, which generates over Rs 4,000 crore per annum, it will not be able to boost the State exchequer.

Against this backdrop, the State Government’s task of generating revenue and funding social sectors like healthcare and livelihood has turned out to be a Herculean task. Major funding will go for COVID control and other healthcare measures.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/covid-19-set-to-hit-state-s-economy-hard.html

27,09-4-20,Akhilesh questions efficacy of Team-11,"



|

Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav questioned the efficacy of Team-11 set up by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to contain the spread of coronavirus.

Questioning the detention of members of Tablighi Jamaat who attended the Nizamuddin markaz meet in Delhi, the SP chief said, “We hear only about the spate of meetings of Team-11 but nothing is known about results of the meeting. Team-11 should find out why the foreign Jamaat members were given visa to travel to India.”

In a statement issued on Wednesday, Akhilesh said that the team should also look into the number of tests for detecting possible COVID-19 patients and also the plight of people affected by the lockdown.

The SP chief alleged that due to the fear of coronavirus, there was negligence in treatment of common people. He said that while providing personal protective equipment to medics, the government should ensure that medical staff do not ignore any patient due to fear of contacting coronavirus.

Akhilesh said, “It is sad that a doctor in Kanpur had to lose his son due to unavailability of ambulance and stretcher and other medical equipment help at LLR Hospital.”

The former chief minister of UP said the state government should focus its attention on efficient management of quarantine centres.

He said the shortage of sanitiser, masks and sanitation in Azamgarh medical college had added to the vulnerability of patients, doctors and paramedics.

He also demanded an objective review of the relief fund for COVID-19 and regular review of government funds.

The SP chief alleged that the supply chain of essential commodities in Kanpur had collapsed due to lockdown, adding to the woes of the common man already suffering from job losses and economic slowdown.

He claimed that basics like milk and bread were not available in Kanpur, while the poor were suffering due to the shortage of medicines.

Extending his support to measures taken by the Yogi Adityanath government to contain the virus spread, Akhilesh said, “I have no objection to the lockdown but the manner of its enforcement should be humane and it should not cause agony to the common man.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-questions-efficacy-of-team-11.html

30,09-4-20,102 hotspots in 15 UP districts sealed,"



|

Taking a cue from Bhilwara (Rajasthan) administration’s fight against coronavirus, the Uttar Pradesh government decided to seal all 102 hotspots in 15 districts in which the number of COVID-19 positive cases are high and suspended all activities in these designated areas till April 15.

Bhilwara was the epicentre of coronavirus spread in Rajasthan in March. The local administration adopted aggressive containment procedures, limiting the virus spread in a short span of time. So much so that since March 30, only one coronavirus positive case has been reported in the district which earned the preventive steps initiated by it the name of ‘Bhilwara Model’.

Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said in Lucknow on Wednesday that hotspots of the districts which reported six or more novel coronavirus positive cases would be sealed and no one, including media persons, would be allowed there.

“All banks, ATMs and other establishments would be closed and local residents would be provided medicines, food grains, milk and vegetables at their doorsteps. Lockdown in other parts of the cities will be enforced as usual,” he said.

After television channels started airing the half-baked news of total sealing of districts on Wednesday afternoon, people rushed to nearby vegetable and grocery stores in local markets to purchase and hoard household edible articles, throwing caution of social distancing to the wind.

In several places, including Narhi area of Hazratganj in the state capital, police had to use force, close down shops and ask people to go back.

There are 102 hotspots in Uttar Pradesh with Agra having the maximum of 22 localities which will be sealed. This is followed by 13 in Ghaziabad, 12 each in Gautam Buddha Nagar and Lucknow, 10 in Kanpur, four in Varanasi, three in Shamli, seven in Meerut, three each in Bulandshahr, Basti and Firozabad, four each in Saharanpur and Maharajganj, and one each in Sitapur and Bareilly.

Meanwhile, DGP HC Awasthi said that a curfew-like situation will be clamped on these hotspot localities and no one would be allowed to come out of the house.

“This is being done to ensure that no infected person comes in contact with others and endangers them,” he said.

Chief Secretary RK Tiwari sent directives to all 15 districts on Wednesday to seal off the hotspot areas with full restrictions.

In his letter, the chief secretary said that all passes issued be reviewed while shops and mandis be closed.

“No person should be allowed to come out of the houses and essentials will be delivered in their houses by the government. Houses in hotspot areas be thoroughly checked and the entire area be sanitised in a big way. Workers engaged for distribution of essentials be transported by pooling vehicles to minimise use of private vehicles,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/102-hotspots-in-15-up-districts-sealed.html

But as there is prohibition for the people to come out of their homes and limited period of opening of these special vegetable markets, besides unavailability of food at these market places due to shutdown of the eateries, farmers of these areas do not like to go to the city areas for selling of their produce.

On the other hand, the local markets here which have been allowed by the administration to open only for three to four hours in every morning are having with oversupplies, making the produce cheap.

Now the vegetable vendors sell cucumber Rs 10 per kg, ladies finger Rs 5, pumpkin Rs 10, ridge gourd Rs 20, parwal Rs 40, bitter gourd Rs 15 , brinjal Rs 10 and long beans Rs 15. Similarly, cauliflower and cabbage fetch Rs 10 per unit.

Ever since the lockdown was announced on Tuesday, the Subarnapur district administration and police have been facing a tough time in preventing people from moving out without legitimate reasons in towns. There have been instances when police had to apply force to prevent social gathering in Sonepur, Birmaharajpur,Ullunda, Binka, Tarbha and Dunguripali towns and maintain social distancing among people buying essentials.

However, the scene is entirely different in rural parts of the district where villages have been barricaded to prevent people from entering. Social gatherings are a strict no-no while hand washing has been mandatory before entering houses.

Villages of Sibtula, Sargaj, Khaliapali and Bahalpadar under Subarnapur district have been shut down for outsiders by locals.

The Chief Minister held a series of separate calls with SAD’s Prakash Singh Badal and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, AAP’s Harpal Singh Cheema (the Leader of Opposition in Vidhan Sabha) and CPI’s Hardev Singh Arshi, preceded by a video conference with the Congress MLAs led by party chief Sunil Jakhar.

All the party leaders extended their support to the State Government in its fight against COVID-19 and broadly agreed with the Government line of action in tackling the problem, though the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders were in favour of distribution of more food packets through the government machinery in the State, said an official spokesperson.

The Chief Minister also assured all the opposition leaders of all possible help from the Government.

Punjab Congress gave complete authority to the Chief Minister to take any decision he deemed fit to deal with the situation as he deemed fit in the larger interest of the state and its people.

Describing the COVID-19 situation as a developing one, with statistics from the world suggesting that things were not good, the Chief Minister said while India was still doing better than many advanced countries, on account of the early lockdown or curfew. But one could not afford to be complacent, he warned.

The Chief Minister said that whatever steps are taken shall be keeping in mind the interest of the people, who also wanted stern measures to tackle the unprecedented crisis.

Earlier, during the video conference with the Congress MLAs, the Chief Minister, while sharing the latest status on COVID-19, said that there had been a sudden spike in cases in Punjab as a result of the Tabligi Jamaat incident of Nizamuddin (Delhi), from where 573 people had come to the state. Of these all but 38 had been traced.

In response to a concern expressed by Fateh Jung Bajwa (Gurdaspur) on vilification of NRIs, who he said were scared, the Chief Minister said that there was no question of vilifying them. He appealed to the NRIs not to be scared but to come forward and disclose their travel history, assuring them that they would not be harassed.

During the video conference, Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar and Speaker Rana KP Singh complimented the Chief Minister for the excellent job done by him and his government in handling the current crisis.

The party would full support to the government in any decision taken on this issue in the days ahead too, said Jakhar. The Speaker also seconded Jakhar, saying that whatever further steps are taken by the government to save the lives of the people would have the full support of the party as well as the citizens of Punjab.

The Chief Minister also asked the Food Department to intensify distribution of dry rations as some of the MLAs said that the same were not reaching all the needy people.

Inderjit Boleria (Amritsar) said that the have-nots were having problems as the demand-supply gap for dry rations was huge. “There has been some delay earlier because of insufficient supply of dal from Markfed but things are now on track, and of the 10 lakh bags, six lakh are already in the process of distribution,” said chief minister while clarifying that the dry rations were only for those who did not have blue cards.

There were suggestions of also including tea leave packets and spices in the rations, and increasing the number of bags to 15 lakhs. The Chief Minister assured that nobody would be allowed to go hungry in the state and the number of bags would be increased if needed.

Responding to queries by certain MLAs, the Chief Minister said that the state was fully geared to handle the upcoming harvesting and procurement season, with nearly 3,800 mandis being set up and CCL also received from RBI.

Linda said, “Their refusal was in protest against the seizure of their 4 bikes which was done under order of the DC Palamu Shanatnu Kumar Agrahari on Tuesday evening April 7 when a mock drill was on here against Covid 19. The loaders wanted their bikes back.”

The SP went on to say loaders at FCI godown too went on strike as a solidarity move. Police got this issue over by releasing the seized bikes to the loaders, he added.

55,09-4-20,UT Admn preparing corona management plan,"In a bid to deal effectively with rapidly evolving Coronavirus (COVID-19) public health emergency, the Chandigarh Administration is preparing a comprehensive COVID-19 management plan.

The comprehensive plan would focus on key areas like accommodation, communication, medical equipments and facilities, requirement of healthcare workers, supply of essential food items among others.

Punjab Governor and UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore has directed the Administration to prepare the plan in view of surge of number of COVID-19 cases across the country in the past one week. UT Home-cum-Health Secretary Arun Kumar Gupta along with medical experts is preparing the COVID management plan.

Under the plan, the Administration has initially proposed three levels of accommodation for COVID-19 positive and suspected cases in the city. COVID care centre would be earmarked for people with mild symptoms of Coronavirus and proposed to be put in quarantine at Hotel Parkview, Panchayat Bhawan, Sood Bhawan among others accommodations in the city.

GMCH-32 and GMSH-16 would be designated as COVID health centres for positive Coronavirus cases with moderate symptoms. Similarly, PGIMER and Sector 48 hospital will be earmarked as exclusive COVID facility for severe positive cases.

Estimating Chandigarh’s population as 12 lakh and a peak of Coronavirus pandemic in the future, the plan is being prepared contemplating different scenarios of contingencies of COVID spreading among the denizens.

So far, 18 positive cases of Coronavirus have been reported in the city, out of which seven have already recovered till Wednesday evening. While 1446 were put in home quarantine as a precautionary measure, 900 have completed the quarantine period. No fresh positive case of Coronavirus has been reported in the city in the past six days and no Coronavirus hotspots have so far been identified in the city.

However, an employee of Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh, who is a resident of Dera Bassi (Mohali) is tested positive on Wednesday, sending alarm bells ringing in the civic body even as the Administration began contact tracing by the late evening.

UT Home-cum-Health Secretary Arun Kumar Gupta told The Pioneer that the Administration is preparing the COVID-19 management plan to deal with any worst-case scenario as the cases are surging across the country. So far, the situation in Chandigarh has remained far better as no case has been reported in the past six days, he said.

The infant is the daughter of NRI couple who had come from Canada on March 13 and was tested positive of Coronavirus on March 30.

UT to follow Centre’s directions on April 14

Amid the concerns that ending the 21-day lockdown on April 14 could lead to spike in COVID-19 cases across the nation, the Chandigarh Administration has decided to follow the Centre’s directions to decide on whether to lift the curfew or put in place the containment policy in high risk zones in the city. While a 21-day nationwide lockdown began from March 25 (12 am), curfew was imposed in Chandigarh on March 24 (12 am) till April 14 to ensure social distancing and combat the spread of COVID-19.

58,09-4-20,Hooda demands Special bonus for farmers,"Demanding ‘special bonus’ for the farmers from the BJP-JJP led coalition government in Haryana, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday said that the government should work out ways to procure wheat crop yields from April 15 instead of April 20. Crops are standing in the fields whereas the weather is changing.

As Punjab government has announced wheat procurement from April 15 so Haryana government should work out ways to procure wheat crop yields from April 15 instead of April 20, he added. Expressing concerns over rising number of corona virus positive cases, he appealed the government to ensure availability of medical equipments like PPE kits, masks, and hand sanitizers among other necessary items in hospitals. He said the government needs to ensure that people especially poor and farmers are benefited from schemes announced by the State government after enforcement of lockdown.

In a telephonic interview with ‘The Pioneer’, Hooda raises the concerns of farmers and the people especially poor being faced after the enforcement of lockdown. Excerpts from the interview:

Why do you want State government to reconsider date for procurement of wheat crop?

We do not want farmers to suffer more. The rains and hailstorms in March have already caused major losses to the farmers. Now crops are standing in the fields whereas the weather is changing again and again. In Haryana, wheat crop yields get ready for harvest before Punjab. The government should rethink and announce procurement of wheat crop yields from April 15 instead of April 20.

State Government claims of having taken several measures for the welfare of farmers. Why are you demanding ‘special bonus’ for farmers?

Farmers have suffered a lot due to unseasonal rains and hailstorms and later lockdown. Labour cost has increased due to shortage of labourers. Prices of every farm related equipments and other necessary items have increased many fold. Delay in procurement of crop yields will result into delay in its payment to the farmers. Following this, farmers who have borrowed or have taken loans would face difficulty to survive. Currently, farmers will first have to spend money to take their crop for storage and then they will have to spend extra to sell it. This will cost farmers double both in terms of the hard work and money. During such a challenging time, government should announce ‘special bonus’ for farmers.

Shortage of combine machines and labourers has added to the woes of framers during lockdown. Do you think government should come out with a plan to address these problems?

I would appeal to the farmers to do whatever they can under the limitations. At the same time, I would also appeal to the State government that there should be uniformity in procurement and they should work out a plan to address the concerns of the farmers immediately.

Government says the procurement of rabi crops will be done first by issuing coupons after collecting the data registered on ""Meri Fasal Mera Byora” portal by the farmers. What would you say?

At this time, I would like to say that State Government should ensure that each and every crop yields of farmers is procured.

How do you assess the situation of Covid-19 outbreak in the State after enforcement of lockdown?

In this critical time, government should take all the possible steps to fend off the Covid-19 spread. Government has its own machinery to review and assess the situation correctly. We will support the Government in whatever steps they take to save human lives.

What are the concerns of the people you are hearing at this juncture?

This is not a time to do politics. I would only say that all safety measures should be taken for the doctors and other medical practitioners working in hospitals.

Also, government must ensure that no family sleeps without food.

There are concerns of alleged victimisation of people of a particular community after Covid positive cases increased in the aftermath of Tablighi Jamaat’s Delhi event. Being a leader of opposition in the Assembly, what is your view on this issue?

No one should be victimized. But at the same time, it is the responsibility of the government to identify those people who are corona virus positive. All should work unitedly to save human lives.

Amid lockdown, what will be your appeal to the people of the State? what do you do when there is lockdown?

I would appeal to the people to follow the government guidelines strictly. I spend maximum time while talking with the farmers and representatives of various panchayats, party leaders and supporters of the State through mobile phone. I hear and try to address their concerns. If time permits then I watch Ramayana and Mahabharata on Television and also read historical and religious books.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hooda-demands-special-bonus-for-farmers.html

61,09-4-20,Admin to set up disinfection chambers at city markets,"With lockdown period expected to be extended further, the East Singhbhum district administration has planned to set up disinfection chambers at city markets. Moreover, if everything goes at planned disinfection tunnels would be seen at inter-state border points.

One such chamber was set up at the temporary vegetable market at Sakchi at the parking bay near the Basant Talkies Roundabout.

“ Sensing the need of sensitisation we have installed the disinfection chamber at the vegetable market which has been temporarily shifted near the Basant Talkies Roundabout for the vegetable sellers and also for the buyer. Depending on the response we would be installing similar facilities at crowded places like Golmuri, Bistupur, Kadma and Sonari,” said Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC), special officer, Krishna Kumar.

Significantly, earlier this week, the district administration had started a full-body disinfection chamber donated by the state health department for healthcare workers dedicated for the isolation wards (set up for novel coronavirus suspected cases).

The portable disinfection chamber has a mist sprayer through which sanitizers would be sprayed on throughout the body disinfecting it in nearly five minutes.

JNAC has also initiated a drive on cleaning and sanitising the open space vegetable markets especially that are allotted during the lockdown. As a result, a majority of people were seen going to market.

The civic body has launched a massive drive to clean and sanitise the markets. Also, he appealed to people to not visit the market daily and stock up for at least three- four days to avoid unnecessary crowd.

He noted that movement of people has been limited to emergency and essential services to contain the possible spread of the coronavirus. In effect, it means citizens cannot come out of their homes and move around in public places unless they have an emergency to explain.

City police have deployed a large force of officers at earmarked crossings to check the movement of vehicles. Multiple teams are patrolling the city to ensure people stay indoors.

The administration has issued a lockdown notice, barring essential and emergency services. “Do not step out of home unless absolutely necessary, otherwise it will not be possible to contain the spread of the contagious virus. Else, be prepared to face the police,” an officer said. Food items and medicines are among services exempt from the lockdown following the outbreak of the virus.

A Disinfection Chamber has been set up at the MGM Hospital as a measure to check the infection of coronavirus. The chamber has been especially set up for doctors and medical staff attending to patients in the isolation ward. Such doctors and medical staff will be moved to the Disinfection Chamber after they emerge from the isolation ward so that the chances of the virus on them are cleared.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/admin-to-set-up-disinfection-chambers-at-city-markets.html
62,09-4-20,Punjab to set up task force to look into lifting of lockdown,"Punjab would soon set up a Task Force to find ways for the State to gradually get out of the unprecedented lockdown.

Announcing this on Wednesday, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh also assured the industry of all support by the Government to address critical issues and challenges in this difficult time.

Capt Amarinder, addressing a video conference of the state’s leading industrialists, sought the industry’s suggestions on the way forward, and invited them to be part of the government’s decision-making process in the extraordinary situation that is prevailing currently.

Among various issues raised by industry leaders was the demand for declaring tractors and ancillary industries as essential and allowing them reopen to meet the urgent needs of farmers in the Rabi harvesting and marketing season. The demand for declaring cycles as essential commodity was also raised.

Another suggestion that came up was to allow the packaging industry to resume operations, given its importance in ensuring streamlined operations of essential commodities.

Other suggestions from the industry related to revival of air cargo services to Chandigarh, as well as incentives to health and medical start-ups in the state. A suggestion for relief to the tourism industry, that had been badly hit by the lockdown, was also discussed.

A major issue discussed at the meeting related to the problems faced by pharmaceutical companies, which were playing a pivotal role in tackling the COVID-19 crisis. Among these problems was closure of inter-state transport in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as certain restrictions to movement of goods and labour from Haryana. Cash flow problems were also highlighted by the industry, who wanted clarity on the payments to be made to the workers during this critical period.

The Chief Minister asked the Industry Department to take urgent notice of these issues and resolve them at the earliest, given the guidelines in place for certain industries to operate amid the national lockdown. If anyone wants to operate, they should approach the State Government and all efforts would be made to address their requests within the framework of the guidelines, he added.

Even as he thanked the industry for their unstinted support to the State Government in this hour of crisis, the Chief Minister said that the battle ahead was a prolonged one, with far-reaching global implications for the economy and the industry.

Pointing out that his request to the industry for holding back and taking care of the migrant labour was not an order but a suggestion, the Chief Minister said since it was still not clear how long the closure or lockdown would need to continue, it was important to keep them back. “Had the migrant labour left, they would not have easily come back, which would have caused immense difficulty for the state, which is heading into the harvesting and procurement season,” he added.

Concerns were expressed at the meeting over the economic slowdown resulting from the lockdown and the CII representative suggested that taxation officers could work from home to process GST and VAT refunds.

It was felt by some industrialists that the post-Corona shift from China to other countries would offer an opportunity for India, which Punjab should actively explore.

Transport Secretary K Siva Prasad said that all efforts were being made to ensure smooth transportation, with control rooms to coordinate and manage the movement between states and districts.

DECISION ON EXTENSION OF CURFEW IN PUNJAB TO BE TAKEN AFTER APR 10 CABINET MEET

Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday made it clear that no decision had yet been taken on extending the curfew in the State beyond April 14.

“ The State Government is yet to take a decision in the matter. A decision in this regard would be taken after the Cabinet meeting scheduled for April 10,” he clarified.

The Chief Minister’s statement came after a faux pass was committed by the General Administration Department in an inter departmental communication, stating that the curfew had been extended till April 30. The said letter was withdrawn later in the day.

The Chief Minister clarified that the speculation on curfew extension had been triggered by an advisory to employees from the General Administration Department on a series of matters relating to the current situation. The said advisory had subsequently been withdrawn by the Chief Secretary on his directives, he added.

“The State Government is continuously assessing and reviewing the evolving situation, which is changing day-to-day, and any decision would be taken in the context of the conditions prevailing around mid-April, keeping in mind the overall interest of the state and its people,” said Capt Amarinder.

“Though pandemic is currently in control in Punjab, nothing could be predicted at the moment, given the ever-changing dynamics of the situation,” said the Chief Minister, adding that all the factors would be taken into account before coming to a final decision on extending or lifting the curfew, either fully or partially.

The early clampdown in India had helped and while the situation was somewhat better than the more advanced nations, one could not get complacent, and the next few days would be critical to any decision on the way forward, he added.

The Chief Minister reiterated that saving lives was the top priority of his government at the moment and whatever decision is taken will be centered around that, seeing how the pandemic shapes up in the state in the coming days.

Notably, the Punjab Government had imposed a statewide curfew on March 23, even a day before the Prime Minister announced the 21-day national lockdown.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-to-set-up-task-force-to-look-into-lifting-of-lockdown.html

“We have suggested for further extending the lockdown for 14 days. Because, there is no other option left, other than an extension,” he said.

The minister further said that at present a war-like situation has not cropped up but it cannot be ruled out in the near future.

“It is good that the state has reported only 10 positive patients out of which nine have fully recovered. The remaining patient’s health is stable and better but it does not mean that we can sit back and relax,” he said.

“If experts are to be believed, a war-like situation against the disease might start in the last week of April or the first week of May.

“Once the quarantine period comes to an end only then we will come to know if we have won the fight or not.”

The health minister on the arrangement to combat the coronavirus outbreak in the state, said: “Since January, preparations are continuously underway and being bettered every passing day. In the coming 10 days, dedicated Covid-19 facilities will be set up at all the divisional headquarters hospitals.

72,09-4-20,Palamu police use drone to identify lockdown violators,"Palamu police have begun using drones to identify flouters of lock down. Its trial was done most successfully on Tuesday itself. Sources said SP Palamu Ajay Linda took all the initiatives in this regard.

At a maximum height of 400 feet or 121 meters AGL (above ground level) drone is allowed to fly by aviation authorities in order to avoid a possible conflict with manned air craft, the chance of which here at this time is not around at all.

The SP said, “We have started using drone to deter people from flouting the lock down. There are habitual or better say congenital flouters of lock down. We believe our eyes on them from a height will make them not to breach lock down.”

Linda said police discovered that a few well meaning youths here have drone which they have given us literally without any fee for flying except for wages of its operator on the ground.

Many people come out with different excuses. A flouter said, “ My car is parked for over 16 days. Its battery will get discharged. I take out it in the open street now. It is a great scene not to have any vehicle on the road.”

“My sister in law is sick. I am to go to her house as in that house is my daughter to inquire about the welfare. Where is the flouting of my lock down?” asked an elderly man here.

Linda, when asked if drone will succeed in keeping rigid violators indoors said, “Our police are making all efforts to keep people indoors but there are many who just not understand it.”

Linda said, “I have made sadar SDPO Sandip Kumar Gupta to monitor drone flying. It will be flown at peak hours when breaching is done more in the name of buying veggies, medicines, milk etc.”

Gupta said, “Once we get information that there is gathering at some locality we rush our drone there. Its hovering has a great psychological impact. We want to use this impact.”

Gupta said, “ The remaining days before April 14 will be most carefully watched and monitored by the police.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/palamu-police-use-drone-to-identify-lockdown-violators.html

The Tablighi Jamaat members had attended a religious congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi against the social distancing protocol amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Vij said the Jamaat members who had failed to report to authorities till 5 pm on Wednesday and test positive for coronavirus will be booked under attempt to murder. Vij, who is also the health minister of the state, has maintained that a sharp spike in the total number of COVID-19 cases in Haryana was due to the sizeable chunk of positive cases belonging to the Jamaat members.

Vij said on Wednesday, “The deadline given to them has ended. Those who will be tracked down now and found COVID positive will be booked under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder).”

He justified invoking of stringent punishment against the members, as he said coronavirus was “highly contagious and fatal disease and someone who deliberately conceals it even after being given enough time deserves to be strictly dealt with”.

Asked if the state planned to give any relaxation to public movement in case the lockdown is extended beyond April 14, the minister said, “We will assess (the situation). We will soon conduct random COVID-19 tests in every district, and based on the report of these tests, will be able to take any decision.”

“Random tests will be conducted to check instances of community spread of the disease,” he said.

86,09-4-20,Let monkeys return to its natural food habit: Forest official,"Troops of monkeys wait eagerly along the deserted national highway for food from dawn to dusk, little knowing about a lockdown that has put a stop to vehicular and human movement in the wake of the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

The simians habituated to being fed by passing bus and truck drivers, tourists and local residents, today still hopefully wait to be fed along the national highway that passes through the picturesque Keshkal valley.

The densely forested valley, the only entry point to the tribal-dominated Bastar division in Chhattisgarh is also home of a large number of monkeys.

With the summer setting in there will be shortage of food and water, two vital essentials for the survival of the long-tailed primates who have over the years become depended on humans for their sustenance.

Hundreds of monkeys can be seen sitting along the highway, waiting with a hope that some vehicle will come along and provide them food and water.

Driven with hunger, many of the long-tailed primates, have returned back to their habitat deep within the dense jungles, many, however, can be still seen lining along the highway in the desperate hope, to be fed.

Most of the female monkeys are heavily pregnant and residents of the valley are now coming forward to feed them at times, depending on whatever means they have but are unable to provide the wild animals water.

Divisional forest officer (DFO) Manivasagan S told The Pioneer that people have been feeding high-calorie diet to the monkeys in the wild.

The DFO said that 75% of the forest in the region has dense tree coves and enough natural food is available for the monkeys to forage.

“But the monkeys along the national highway have become so habituated to easy diet provided by human beings that refuse to budge.

“Now with no food available, a large number of the simians have returned to their natural habitat within the forest in search for food,” Manivasagan S said.

“The best option for the monkeys still remaining, should be to return to their natural habitat and forage for food available in the forest,” he said.

The divisional forest office is getting calls from the local people, asking the department to feed these wild animals to save them, said the DFO.

“But in view of a tiger being affected by Covid-19 virus(in a zoo in Bronx in New York, in the US) and guidelines issued by the national and state zoo authorities, there is no option for feeding them,” he said.

“The best option is, the monkeys will have to return to their natural habitat, like other wild animals and forage for food from the forest.”

On the scarcity of water, the DFO said, at present there are several water holes and natural streams in the region.

“If necessary, in future, more such water holes will be dug and fruit- bearing trees will be planted.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/let-monkeys-return-to-its-natural-food-habit--forest-official.html

98,09-4-20,Dist Admin seeks dry ration kits instead of cooked food,"Considering the increasing demand for dry ration in Dehradun among those in need during the lockdown, the district administration has appealed citizens to donate dry ration kits instead of cooked food packets.

Hundreds of individuals and several organisations have come forward to support the district administration in providing meals to the destitute, daily wagers, students and senior citizens among others who are unable to secure regular meals during the lockdown. The administration has provided thousands of cooked food packets besides hundreds of dry ration kits. So far, the requirement of cooked food packets has always been more than dry ration kits in the city during the lockdown. However, in the last few days, the demand for dry ration kits (Annapurna kits) is more than the cooked food packets. On Monday, the district administration distributed 415 dry ration kits besides 7,150 cooked food packets. On Tuesday the administration distributed 1,151 dry ration kits which was more than twice the number of dry ration kits the previous day. However, the number of dry ration kits distributed on Wednesday was only 671. Informing about the rise in the demand for dry ration kits, Dehradun Chief Development Officer (CDO) Nikita Khandelwal said, ""The requirement of food packets and ration keeps fluctuating but in the last few days, the demand for dry ration is more. Those people who were provided dry ration in the initial days of lockdown have finished their supplies, so we have provided them more ration. The other reason is that some people have also begun to cook their own food, so they demand just raw ingredients to cook their meals."" The ration kits provided by the administration generally last up to five to seven days or more depending on the number of people in a family, said Khandelwal.

The donation of dry ration kits has also increased through the online Doon Happy Meals initiative of Dehradun district administration. Talking about this, Khandelwal said, ""Due to the decline in the demand for cooked food packets, we are requesting people who approach us to donate dry ration kits instead of cooked food packets, if possible. We do not want to waste the efforts and assistance of so many people in providing cooked food when there is not enough requirement for it.""

However, Khandelwal added that the situation might be different in Dehradun if the period of lockdown is extended in the state for more weeks. ""We might need more cooked food packets besides dry ration kits in case the lockdown gets extended but presently we prefer the dry ration over cooked food,"" added the CDO.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dist-admin-seeks-dry-ration-kits-instead-of-cooked-food.html

104,09-4-20,"Universities’ helplines face students' anxieties due to uncertainty, lifestyle changes","From uncertainties pertaining to the lockdown to career-related anxiety and symptoms of depression due to being away from home, helplines and counselling services being run online by various universities are dealing with the psychological concerns of students during the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier this week, the University Grants Commission (UGC) directed all universities and colleges to set up mental health helplines to address students' concerns during the health crisis.

Even before the UGC directive, many universities like Delhi University (DU) and Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) here had already begun counselling services for students. Private universities like Ashoka University in Haryana are also providing such services to the students.

Dr SP Jena, head of DU's Psychology Department, said the counselling services were started through email on March 3.

""We have been getting 10-15 queries every day. The queries pertain to panic attacks and general anxiety which students might have been experiencing earlier but have got aggravated due to this situation,"" he said.

Dr Jena said he asks students to not follow news about coronavirus and engage themselves more in entertainment activities to divert attention.

They want to expand the counselling services to help staffers of the varsity but right now, they are only focussing on students, he said.

""Students also call for queries about their academics, with problems of concentration. They do not have a time management plan and I suggest to them to have a time table. It's a good thing they are approaching us,"" he added.

DU's Rajdhani College has formed a committee comprising a counsellor who retired from AIIMS, college officials, students, incharges of National Cadet Corps (NCC) Girls and Boys divisions and northeast students to help the students overcome issues related to mental and physical health during this time of crisis.

""The students call about queries on when the exams will happen and whether the varsity will promote students in case exams are not able to take place,"" said college principal Dr Rajesh Giri.

The JMI has also started tele-counselling services for students and staff members distressed by the coronavirus crisis.

Najma Akhtar, vice-chancellor of JMI, said the main query the counsellers are getting is when will the lockdown end.

""There are around 300 hostellers who had to stay back. They keep on asking, 'What will happen to us? When will be go back home?' There are around 40 foreign students in our hostels. The main query is how they will go back home,"" she said.

""We have written to every embassy informing them about the students.

I am scared that they should not suffer from depression. They had the impression that they would be going back home during the summer break but now they are uncertain,"" Akhtar said.

Dr Arvinder Singh, director and founder of Ashoka Centre For Well Being at Ashoka University, said the centre currently has six counsellers and students can book online sessions.

""We use Google hangout and Zoom app to reach out to students. We also have a telephonic helpline which runs for a couple of hours every day for students and faculty members,"" she said.

Singh is also conducted group therapy sessions online to help students cope with anxiety.

""It's a time when students are going through a lot of anxiety, fear and are also feeling boxed in. There is uncertainty about what will happen, how will we graduate and the job market when the economy has taken a downturn,"" she said.

Dr Singh said they have a multi-pronged approach to help students – a counselling centre, group therapy sessions, peer student groups – cope with this extraordinary situation.

""We give self-care tips and also tell them about the importance of sleep hygiene,"" she added.

Ambedkar University, Delhi (AUD) runs the Ehsaas Psychotherapy and Counselling Clinic to meet the needs of those experiencing psychosocial difficulties.

Professor Anu Singh Lather, Vice Chancellor, AUD said members from the clinic are available daily since March 23 on phone and email to help the varsity's students in dealing with the anxieties created by sudden isolation, change of routine and stress about academic and career plans.

The opportunity to share problems and difficulties with therapists leads to considerable reduction in distress, she said, adding that faculty members are also being encouraged to incorporate mentorship and counselling while conducting online teaching sessions.

According to counsellors at AUD, most students have reported distress associated with the pandemic and the other changes in lifestyle associated with it.

They are worried about their future even in the immediate context. The likelihood that job opportunities will go down is a great concern, they said. In addition, a large number of students are feeling anxious because they are far away from their families and cannot travel home because of the lockdown.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/universities----helplines-face-students--anxieties-due-to-uncertainty--lifestyle-changes.html

Videos showing a particular community in bad light have been doing the rounds on WhatsApp since the Tablighi Jamaat imbroglio came to light. According to figures shared by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, more than 35 per cent of the total COVID-19 cases reported in India have links with the Tablighi Jamaat congregation held in New Delhi. This finding, sources said, has led to large-scale mobilization of people on social media against a particular community.

In the wake of the incidents, police here have put all social media platforms here under scanner. Any person found misusing social media to spread communal hatred will be found and sent to jail, police said. ""We are keeping an eye on all social media activities across the State. You will invite trouble even if you circulate communally-sensitive content,"" Meena said. By now, four positive cases of Coronavirus have been reported in Jharkhand. While only one of them had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi, at least three of the four patients belong to a particular community.

108,09-4-20,Milk producers raise alarm due to cattle feed scarcity,"Supply of several essential things is running low due to the nationwide lockdown, till April, 14. Now milk producers of the State are facing big crisis of animal feed and other necessary items which are not available in markets.

Though dairy and milk goods, selling animal fodder fall under essential services according to Home Ministry guidelines, the Lockdown has hit their daily routine and transportation of fodder and cattle feed to the markets.

The milk producers and sellers of the State are mostly dependent on other states for animal feed. Fodder mostly used to come from Bihar, but due to the lockdown the suppliers of fodder are facing big problem to supply fodder from the State. During the first week of the lockdown very few trucks of fodder came to the State which caused huge scarcity for the fodder among dairy farm owners. Some days later some more trucks of fodder started coming in the State but it is not enough to fulfill demand.

Ramchandra Ray, a resident of Kanke Road, who has seven cows and four buffaloes, informed that he is facing very tough time now a days as cattle have started giving less milk than earlier due to scarcity of fodder and other cattle feed. Now another difficulty came forward to keep them alive on less diet of fodder, he added.

Ray and other dairy farmers have requested the State Government to ensure availability and supply of cattle feed during the lockdown period.

In a video conferencing with Union Minister of Agriculture, Narendra Singh Tomar, Jharkhand Agriculture Minister, Badal recently said that before imposition of lockdown 13,0000 liters of milk had been procured per day by the Jharkhand Milk Federation but currently only 35,000liters of milk is being sold, the remaining milk needs to be distributed among the poor for which Rs 12 crore is required to given to milk federations every month.

In other part of the State the situation for milk producer is also similar in cities like Dhanbad, Bokaro, Hazaribagh, Jamshedpur and others. In these cities a large numbers of residents are settled from other states.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/milk-producers-raise-alarm-due-to-cattle-feed-scarcity.html

111,09-4-20,Politicising Tablighi issue not right: Didi,"Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday chided groups that were “playing communal politics” over Tablighi Jamaat’s mass congregation last month in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area causing proliferation of corona cases across the country. “Politicising issues” was not the right thing “during national crisis” the Bengal Chief Minister said wondering “why those people were given permission to organise the programme in the first place.”

A few thousand people including some infected delegates from corona-affected countries had assembled at a religious event sponsored by Tablighi Jamaat in Nizamuddin area during the third week of March. They did so in alleged disregard of Delhi Government’s orders prohibiting any gathering of more than 200 people.

The Chief Minister who had on Tuesday refused to take “communal questions” on Wednesday slammed the groups that she said were “indulging in communal politics over the Nizamuddin incident.”

This was “completely unacceptable,” she said reminding “no disease or pandemic attacks you by your religion or caste. This is no time to play communal politics that some people and groups are merrily indulging in. It is a time to take everyone together to fight the global disease… Please don’t communalise it,” she said.

Questioning the efficiency of the authorities responsible for enforcing orders Banerjee asked “why the gathering was not stopped when it was taking place initially” and denounced the political practice of pointing fingers after the damage had been done. “What is the point after saying a lot of things when things were allowed to happen” she said reminding how the national Capital had witnessed a communal riot days before the lockdown.

“This is the time to fight the menace united instead of playing communal politics,” she said.

On whether she was in the know of things regarding any possible extension of the lockdown she replied in the negative saying she had no information. “Some people are making some suggestions to extend the lockdown period. Things will be clear only after further discussion. But as of now I have no information,” she said adding “even if it is extended the government will have to handle it in a humanitarian manner because the common people are facing huge problem.”

Meanwhile, even as the opposition questioned the veracity of the reports served by the Government, filing two public interest litigations in the Calcutta High Court, Bengal witnessed two more cases of corona infections in the past 24 hours taking the total number of active cases to 71. “Since the past 24 hours we have two more cases of information,” the Chief Minister said. “Till Tuesday the total number of cases were 69 with 5 deaths today the number of cases have gone up to 71,” she said adding out of the 71 cases “61 infected people come from 11 families.”

Accusing the Government of furnishing “false and fudged reports,” on the number of corona infections and deaths in Bengal, State CPI(M) leader Fuad Halim on Wednesday filed a PIL in Calcutta High Court seeking directions to the Government to follow the guidelines recommended by the ICMR and WHO which he alleged was not being followed in the State.

Halim, himself a medical practitioner alleged that the Government was not only ignoring the recommendations of ICMR but it was also looking through the guidelines given by the WHO about cremation of dead bodies.

Apart from the CPI(M) leader an advocate of the High Court too filed a second PIL on the matter. The Court has directed the Government to return with detailed reports of corona cases and deaths in the State, sources said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/politicising-tablighi-issue-not-right--didi.html
112,09-4-20,Dharavi becomes cause of concern as cases rise to 10,"The coronavirus began to rear its ugly head in Dharavi in north-central Mumbai on Wednesday, as the total numbers of persons testing positive for the pandemic rose to 10 in Asia’s largest slum.

As Mumbai battles against the spread of coronavirus, Dharavi is being seen as its Achilles’ heel right from the day one of Covid-19 outbreak in the metropolis. The health authorities get alarmed if one case gets reported from this most densely populated area in the world. For, they apprehend that there could be community spread of the pandemic in this slum.

On Wednesday, the total number of infected cases touched ten as a 50-year-old female sanitary worker tested positive for the pandemic at the KEM Hospital. She is a resident of Muslim Nagar in Dhavari.

Dharavi, where a 56-year-old resident of Dharavi’s Shahunagar area, succumbed to the pandemic on April 1, has been in the news since then for being the most sensitive area where community spread of the disease is easy. Giving the details of the coronavirus infection in Dharavi, a spokesperson of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said here on Wednesday: “Till today, there have been 10 cases in Dharavi. Four cases have been reported from Dr Baliga Nagar where one person died and three persons are hospitalised. A 35-year-old male doctor from Vaibhav Apartment has tested positive for the pandemic, while two men – aged 49 years and 25 years – are infected in Mukund Nagar. A 21-year youngster has tested positive in Madina Nagar, while 35 year man from Dhanwada Chawl who lives in Wadala hostel has tested positive. Today, one 50-year-oldwoman from Muslim tested positive in Muslim Nagar”.

Taking serious cognisance of growing number of Coronavirus cases in Dharavi, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope directed the police to enforce the “lockdown strictly” in the dense slum.

Talking to persons, Tope said: “ Apart from ensuring social distancing, it is very essential that lockdown is enforced very strictly in Dharavi. The police should take stern action against those defying lockdown regulations in Dharavi”.

On Tuesday, Tope had visited Dharavi police station to take stock of the situation in the area. Local Congress MLA and School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad had accompanied him.

Located between Western Railway’s Bandra-Matunga and Central Railway’s Sion-Matunga stations in north-central Mumbai, Dharavi is home to over anywhere from 60,000 to 70,000 families. The Mithi River slices through a portion of Dharavi into the Mahim Creek and then onto the Arabian Sea. Spread over 240-hectare area, Dharavi has remained an ugly face and a dark underbelly of Mumbai – a largest slum which has been romanticised in Indian films over the years.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/dharavi-becomes-cause-of-concern-as-cases-rise-to-10.html

As the situation is turning grim in certain pockets of Kashmir valley, the Government on Wednesday decided to conduct door to door testing of people residing in Red Zones in strict manner so that chain of covid-19 virus would be broken.

A total number of 51 villages spread across nine districts of the state have been declared red-zones in Jammu & Kashmir.

115,09-4-20,State doctors suggest extending lockdown period,"Renowned doctors of the State today unanimously suggested the Government to extend the duration of lockdown in Jharkhand to avert possibility of further spread of coronavirus infection in the State. The doctors said that social distancing and use of masks is the right way to safeguard people from the deadly disease.

The doctors expressed their opinion during a meeting with Chief Minister Hemant Soren at State Secretariat here on Wednesday, where the CM praised the efforts of doctors in the war against the pandemic and said that their role in the battle would be decisive in the State.

The CM said, “You all have a big role in the fight against COVID-19. Your suggestions will play a big role in this war. The government has strengthened social security in this phase of transition, but we are somewhat behind in health facilities and resources. We have to decide together how to produce better results with limited resources. Resources are less but we have immense confidence to fight the battle.”

The doctors informed the CM that the prices of medicines have increased and the government should pay attention to this. The CM assured the doctors that black marketing will be stopped by the government.

All of you should inform the government from time to time, so that the government can take tough decisions against those who commit black marketing,” he said.

The CM said that lockdown is a challenge in Jharkhand, which everyone is facing. “Lockdown is being followed completely in rural areas, but in urban areas people are not following it completely. About 7 lakh people of the state are stranded in other states including Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala, Tamil Nadu. In such a situation, when the stranded people come after the lockdown, then we have to face a different challenge. The State government is trying its best to help the trapped people. After ending the lockdown in the State, after assessing the circumstances, the government will decide to end or continue,” the CM said.

Dr. Amar Kumar Singh, Dr. Pradeep Kumar Singh, Dr. Bharti Kashyap, Dr BP Kashyap, Dr. Iqbal, Dr. Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal, Dr. Vijay Mishra, Dr. Rajesh Kumar, Dr. Nitesh, Dr. PN Singh and other physicians put their suggestions in the meeting.

Dr Bharti Kashyap suggested providing special security to women doctors’ teams that are visiting hotspot areas in the wake of protests by locals. She said that ICMR has permitted Rapid Antibody Testing to all NABL accredited laboratories. All hospitals should get their employees tested because hospitals are the biggest hotspots. In a couple of days private labs in Jharkhand will get test kits, which is a good screening test.

Dr. B. P. Kashyap suggested discharging patients soon after the operation and the government employees are being given full salary by the government, they should also make strict rules for the duty in the hospital, because even after the whole salary many staffs are absent and hospital work is greatly affected.

The meeting was attended by Health Minister Banna Gupta, Chief Secretary Sukhdev Singh, Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Rajiv Arun Ekka, Health Secretary Dr. Nitin Madan Kulkarni, OSD to CM Gopalji Tiwari, Press Advisor to CM Abhishek Prasad, RIMS Director Dr DK Singh, IPRD Director Rajeev Lochan Bakshi, Senior Private Secretary to Chief Minister Sunil Srivastava, doctors and representatives of private hospitals.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-doctors-suggest-extending-lockdown-period.html
116,09-4-20,"No fresh case in 48 hours, 1315 tested","No fresh cases of COVID-19 were reported in Jharkhand in the past 48 hours – an indication that the virus was not spreading in the State as rapidly as in some other parts of the country, a report released by the National Health Mission (NHM) said on Wednesday.

By Wednesday, the Government collected samples of at least 1315 Coronavirus suspects, and 1099 of them tested negative. The last case of COVID-19 was reported here from Ranchi after a 54-year-old woman from Hindpiri tested positive.

However, while there has been no major surge in the number of cases reported, the fear of community transfer in Hindpiri locality is haunting health officials here. Sources from the health department said that the woman who tested positive on Monday has denied any direct contact with the Malaysian woman who was the first COVID-19 patient of Jharkhand.

""She has two sons who roam across the locality. Her husband moves out of home to sell vegetables every day. It is impossible to confirm from where she got the virus,"" said Health Secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni.

All the four patients in Jharkhand are undergoing treatment in isolation wards of Government hospitals here. However, none of them has recovered. Most of them, sources said, have fever, cough and some have complained of diarrhea. Out of the four cases, two are from Ranchi, and one each from Hazaribag and Bokaro. Out of the four patients, only two had travel history to foreign countries. One of the remaining two contracted the virus in West Bengal and the other got it through local transmission.

Despite a delayed entry in Jharkhand, the virus has already infected people living in rural areas – a cause for concern for the Government. The number of cases here quadrupled in a fortnight, and many people who might be infected have not even been tested, said a source from the health department.

Meanwhile, the Government is not only combating the virus, but also attempts by locals to keep their history of contact with patients a secret, a senior health official has said. Rumours about poor treatment meted out to suspects in Isolation Centres have made many locals resist screening and sample collection, he added. Rumours spread on social media have also added to the problems of the Government.

117,09-4-20,"Ranchi admin brings out cost-effective protective gear, face masks","The Ranchi district administration has come up with an innovative idea to fight against COVID-19. Ranchi administration has presented a cost effective protective gear and protective face masks for the frontline workers regarding their safety which are manufactured in the district.

The district administration is currently producing two types of protective gear-- one made of 90GSM tarpaulin plastic which is reusable after a wash and the other made of 50GSM LDPE, which can be disposed after single use. Currently being manufactured in the district textiles factories like Arvind Mills, Orient Crafts and Asha Enterprises and the production is currently at 100 units per day, which will be scaled up in the coming days.

The extremely cost effective Tarapaulin protective gear kit can be dipped in hypo-chlorite solution for the standard half hour auto clave and these kits are now being utilized by frontline health workers going in for contact testing several times.

The manufacturing cost involved in each such kit is merely Rs 300, which is one of the cost effective solution in times of the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, 50 kits have been sent to district administration in east Singhbhum and Pakur, thus solving to a great extent a crisis of PPE equipment that has risen due to lack of quality and cost effective products immediately. The LDPE variant is priced at Rs 150 and is disposable in nature.

The Ranchi district administration has also developed a face sheet or visor, which covers the face above a mask as an additional protection layer; available in the markets at Rs 50/ piece for less than Rs 5/ unit which is also reusable after sterilisation. This is made by Sakhi Mandals if the district these will be sold at Rs 7/unit with Rs 2 going towards the rural women involved in its manufactures. At a time when frontline workers stepping out in quarantine or isolation zones are at an all time high risk with lack of proper PPE, these solutions, tailor made for the pandemic is showing the way forward.

Meanwhile in other develpment Ranchi DC Rai Mahimapat Ray and SSP Anish Gupta visited nearby Tamar area of district and assessed the facilities at Mukhyamantri Daal Bhaat kendras. The two senior officers tested food at Didi kitchen.

138,09-4-20,Gadkari holds meet to assess corona impact on road projects,"Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday chaired a virtual meeting comprising 300 officials from the road ministry, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), and National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corp. Ltd (NHIDCL) to assess the impact of the outbreak of covid-19 on road projects as well as the Government’s strategy after the lockdown is lifted.

Ministry sources said that Gadkari asked officials to make the best use of the lockdown, and complete pending work such as clearing dues to contractors, granting project approvals, so that construction work can resume in full swing as soon as the lockdown is lifted.

During the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of novel coronavirus, which also resulted in the ban of construction activity, along with shortage of labourers, construction workers have moved to back to their villages.

The shortage of labour could be a challenge even after the lockdown and this could hurt construction activity for some time, even if the lockdown is lifted on April 14.

The road ministry plans to seek home ministry’s nod to resume road maintenance work in areas that are not so densely populated, and at low-risk places, where the number of covid-19 cases are not big.

“If this is allowed (If maintenance work is resumed), it will boost the confidence of the labourers, who are already stuck at various places, away from their family,"" a Road Ministry official said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/gadkari-holds-meet-to-assess-corona-impact-on-road-projects.html
139,09-4-20,BoG asks medical colleges to continue with services of postgraduate residents,"To ensure there is no shortage of frontline workers for treatment of Covid patients arriving at the hospitals, the Board of Governors (BoG), formed in suppression of the Medical Council of India (MCI), has asked the medical colleges to continue with the services of the postgraduate (PG) residents in handling the pandemic till the fresh batch arrives in the colleges.

The move follows concerns that not only final year exams of the Post Graduate courses like Diploma, MD or MS have been delayed but even the counselling for the admission to PG courses has been postponed in the wake of the Coronavirus outbreak in the country.

The current pandemic has created a shortage of medical staff and equipment to handle covid-19 cases. Currently, there are over 4,500 active coronavirus cases in India, with only limited medical staff and resources.

“All the colleges and universities which have not yet connected their final year PG exams are advised to do so as soon as the situation is under control.

“In order to ensure that there is no shortage of Residents while handling Covid-19 cases the service of these postgraduate students as Residents may be continued until fresh batches have joined,” said the advisory issued in view of an extraordinary situation created due to the outbreak of COVID19

The BoG has also asked all medical institutions whether private or central/state-funded to continue the availability of accommodation, payment of stipend for all final year PG students during the lockdown period as their work is being extended too. “No institute is allowed to deny both these facilities,” said the advisory.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bog-asks-medical-colleges-to-continue-with-services-of-postgraduate-residents.html

141,09-4-20,Millions more nurses needed in corona fight,"There are just under 28 million nurses worldwide on the frontline battlingCovid-19 to save patients infected with the deadly virus which has taken over 1 million people in its grip. The world needs millions more nurses given the scale of the pandemic.

According to a global report, prepared by the World Health Organisation and released recently there is a global shortfall of 5.9 million nurses, with the greatest gaps in developing nations.

Between 2013 and 2018, nursing numbers increased by 4.7 million. Ironically, one in every eight nurses practices in a country other than the one where they were born or trained. Ageing also threatens the nursing workforce: one out of six of the world’s nurses are expected to retire in the next 10 years, says the WHO in its latest report “The State of the World’s Nursing 2020”.

The report said more than 80 per cent of the world’s nurses work in countries that are home to half of the world’s population.

The report in partnership with the International Council of Nurses (ICN) and Nursing Now, emphasises on the important role of the nurses who account for more than half of all the world’s health workers, providing vital services throughout the health system.

To avert the global shortage, the report estimates that countries experiencing shortages need to increase the total number of nurse graduates by on average 8% per year, along with improved ability to be employed and retained in the health system.

This would cost roughly US$ 10 per capita (population) per year, suggests the report which provides an in-depth look at the largest component of the health workforce while identifying the important gaps and priority areas for investment in nursing education, jobs to strengthen nursing around the world.

“Around the world they (nurses) are demonstrating their compassion, bravery and courage as they respond to the COVID-19 pandemic: never before has their value been more clearly demonstrated,” points out the report as it called the, as the “backbone of any health system.”

“Today, many nurses find themselves on the frontline in the battle against Covid-19,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general.

“Politicians understand the cost of educating and maintaining a professional nursing workforce, but only now are many of them recognising their true value,” added ICN president Annette Kennedy.

“Every penny invested in nursing raises the wellbeing of people and families in tangible ways that are clear for everyone to see. This report highlights the nursing contribution and confirms that investment in the nursing profession is a benefit to society, not a cost.

“The world needs millions more nurses, and we are calling on governments to do the right thing, invest in this wonderful profession and watch their populations benefit from the amazing work that only nurses can do.”

About 90 per cent of all nurses are female, yet few nurses are found in senior health leadership positions-- the bulk of those positions are held by men.

“This report places much-needed data and evidence behind calls to strengthen nursing leadership, advance nursing practice, and educate the nursing workforce for the future,” said Lord Nigel Crisp, co-chair of Nursing Now.

In India too, situation is not impressive, there is a crippling shortage of nurses. Currently, India has only 1.7 nurses available per thousand population against WHO recommendation of 2.5 nurses per thousand population.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/millions-more-nurses-needed-in-corona-fight.html

143,09-4-20,Equities surrender gains as virus concerns weigh,"Equity benchmarks failed to hold on to intra-day gains on Wednesday as investors turned jittery amid an unabated rise in coronavirus cases.

Plunging over 1,300 points from the day’s high, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 173.25 points or 0.58 per cent lower at 29,893.96. It hit an intra-day high of 31,227.97.

Similarly, the NSE Nifty closed 43.45 points, or 0.49 per cent, down at 8,748.75.

Traders said the previous session’s euphoria evaporated and volatility set in on account of speculation that the central Government was mulling lockdown extension beyond April 14. Further, the Indian markets moved in sync with global benchmarks as worries over the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continued to weigh on investor sentiment.

TCS was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding 3.91 per cent, followed by Titan (3.47 per cent), ICICI Bank (2.18 per cent), SBI (1.85 per cent), Bharti Airtel (1.80 per cent) and ITC (1.60 per cent).

On the other hand, Sun Pharma, NTPC, IndusInd Bank and Bajaj Finance were among the top gainers, spurting up to 4.69 per cent.

“Markets gave up gains, following a negative opening in the European markets and uncertainty regarding the spread of Covid-19 infections. Markets are also uncertain as to the Government response after the official 21 day lockdown expires on April 14.

“Some States are looking to extend the lockdown and some are for withdrawing it in a phased manner. The longer the lockdown stays, more the impact on the economy and companies,” said Vinod Nair, Head of research at Geojit Financial Services.

BSE realty, consumer durables, IT, teck, telecom and banking indices ended in the red, while healthcare, auto and utilities rose. Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices outperformed the benchmarks, jumping up to 1.90 per cent.

Global sentiment turned negative after the US posted a record single-day jump of over 1,800 Covid-19 deaths.

145,09-4-20,Cong raps Centre for delayed action in tackling corona,"Soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi convened the meeting with floor leaders of political parties with more than five MPs in the Parliament and discussed the future course of action to fight against the corona pandemic, the Congress blamed the Centre for delayed action to tackle the menace.

The party indicated that the Centre will not lift the lockdown. ""It is likely that the government may extend the lockdown,"" Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said after the meeting.

Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said the prime minister told the meeting that he has received several requests for extension of the lockdown to contain COVID-19, but will take a call on it only after consulting experts and the chief ministers of various states.

Azad and Chowdhury were the Congress representatives at the meeting of the floor leaders of 15 parties with the PM.

Azad said around 80 per cent of the leaders from various political parties, who interacted with the prime minister through video-conferencing, favoured extending the lockdown.

He said his party put forth certain suggestions with regard to the crisis in the farming sector.

Former party chief Rahul Gandhi, on his part, tweeted and blamed the Centre for the unplanned lockdown which will now harm the farm sector as Rabi harvesting is around. Party chief Sonia Gandhi has convened a meeting of State Congress chiefs on Saturday to review and decide the future course of action to decide in the fight against coronavirus.

Modi will be holding his second interaction with all Chief Ministers on April 11, following which he could also address the nation.

""The Prime Minister told the all-party meeting that he is happy that political parties have risen above politics and come together in national interest in this hour of crisis,"" Azad said.

He added that Modi told the meeting that he will try and implement the suggestions put forth by various leaders.

""The Prime Minister said he is receiving requests for extending the lockdown, but he will talk to chief ministers and experts before taking any decision in the best interest of the nation,"" the Congress leader said.

Azad suggested the prime minister to set up a task force comprising Union ministers and chief ministers of various states to recommend the way forward and help people tide over the crisis.

He also suggested setting up of a multi-party working group to help the government tackle the COVID-19 crisis.

Azad said the Congress has called for a special financial package for the states most affected by the coronavirus outbreak.

Chowdhury said the Congress has suggested to the prime minister that farmers may be exempted from the 21-day lockdown for the harvesting of rabi crops. The party has also demanded that all taxes on fertilisers be withdrawn.

Chowdhury said his party has suggested that those enrolled under the rural job scheme MGNREGA be given priority while carrying out harvesting of the standing crop.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-raps-centre-for-delayed-action-in-tackling-corona.html
146,09-4-20,Crisis to hit 40 cr Indians working in informal sector,"The coronavirus crisis may push 40 crore Indians working in the informal sector further into poverty. The International Labour Organization (ILO) in its report titled ‘ILO Monitor 2nd edition: COVID-19 and the world of work’, says the pandemic is likely to wipe out 19.5 crore full time jobs or 6.7% of working hours globally in the second half of the year. It said that the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting 2.7 billion workers globally due to lockdowns.

Describing the coronavirus pandemic as ""the worst global crisis since World War II"", the report says about 40 crore workers in India working in the informal economy are at risk of falling deeper into poverty.

“In India, with a share of almost 90 per cent of people working in the informal economy, about 400 million workers or 40 crore in the informal economy are at risk of falling deeper into poverty during the crisis. Current lockdown measures in India, which are at the high end of the University of Oxford's COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index, have impacted these workers significantly, forcing many of them to return to rural areas,” ILO said.

""In India, Nigeria and Brazil, the number of workers in the informal economy affected by the lockdown and other containment measures is substantial,"" ILO said.

In India, to bring back the economy and to ensure minimum impact on informal sector due to coronavirus, the Government has asked all public and private companies to ensure that they do not cut salaries of their staff or resort to layoffs of their employees amid the lockdowns. Besides, it has transferred Rs 1.75 lakh crore to “80 crore poorest Indians” through direct benefit transfer (DBT) under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) over three months starting April 1. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s weekly tracker survey indicates that the coronavirus effect may have left a devastating impact on the economy, sending urban unemployment rate soaring to 30.9%. Overall unemployment has risen to 23.4%.

The report said the disruption to the world's economies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of this year – the equivalent of 195 million jobs worldwide. Worldwide, two billion people work in the informal sector (mostly in emerging and developing economies) and are particularly at risk, the report said, adding that the COVID-19 crisis is already affecting tens of millions of informal workers.

Large reductions are foreseen in the Arab States (8.1 per cent, equivalent to 5 million full-time workers), Europe (7.8 per cent, or 12 million full-time workers) and Asia and the Pacific (7.2 per cent, 125 million full-time workers), it said. Huge losses are expected across different income groups but especially in upper-middle income countries (7.0 per cent, 100 million full-time workers), far exceeding the effects of the 2008-9 financial crisis, the report warned. ""The COVID-19 pandemic is having a catastrophic effect on working hours and earnings, globally,"" it said.

More than four out of five people (81 per cent) in the global workforce of 3.3 billion are currently affected by full or partial workplace closures, it said. Employment contraction has already begun on a large (often unprecedented) scale in many countries. In the absence of other data, changes in working hours, which reflect both layoffs and other temporary reductions in working time, give a better picture about the dire reality of the current labour market situation.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/crisis-to-hit-40-cr-indians-working-in-informal-sector.html

The Minister has asked States to ensure that farmers don’t face any problems in shipping exportable items, which will boost farmers’ income during the lockdown.

Tomar held a video conference with senior officers to review steps for facilitating farming activities during lockdown.

“We have exempted all kinds of harvesting and sowing activities from lockdown to ensure farmers don’t suffer and lose out during the peak harvesting season. We have opened interstate transportation to facilitate seamless transport of agri products for intra as well as international sale,” Tomar told officials in a meeting.

The Minister said the sowing of crops will begin soon and there should be no shortage of seeds and fertilisers. Exports of foodgrains and Agricultural products should also not be affected, he added.

The Government has exempted from the lockdown the operations of agencies engaged in procurement of agriculture products, including MSP operations; ‘Mandis’ operated by the Agriculture Produce Market Committee or as notified by the State Government; Farming operations by farmers and farm workers in the field.

The Government has allowed traders and bulk purchasers to buy agricultural products directly from farm gates through farmer producer organisations and Government-owned warehouses, bypassing mandis, to ease procurement and transportation of agricultural goods.

The Centre has identified 21 agricultural products, including honey, potatoes, grapes, soya beans and groundnuts, which Indian can export, taking advantage of the trade restrictions against Chinese goods. In 2018-19, the latest year for which data is available, India’s agricultural exports stood at US $38 billion.

Union HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ on Wednesday appealed to recruiters to not withdraw any job offer made to students during campus placements due to the economic slowdown created by coronavirus pandemic.

The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) will hold special placement drives for those students whose job offers got cancelled amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, Pokhriyal said.

Both the chains of IITs and Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) placements were revoked due to uncertainty among companies in view of the coronavirus pandemic. The HRD Minister had last week directed directors of 23 IITs to ensure that campus placements are not affected due to the situation.

The All IITs’ Placement Committee (AIPC) had also reached out to all the companies that visited for campus recruitment, requesting them to not rescind placement offers made for the academic year 2019-20.

IIT Delhi Director V. Ramgopal Rao had also issued a public appeal last week to all recruiters. Rao argued that since all IITs strictly follow the equal opportunity principle [one candidate, one job], withdrawing an offer would mean students “will end up not having any job right now”.

“We all understand these are difficult times. But please be considerate to keep your promises. A few months of delay may be fine. Please do not complicate the lives of these brightest children in an already complex environment. If at all, they are capable of getting you out of recession faster than you can imagine,” he wrote in his appeal shared on social media.

154,09-4-20,Thousands leave Wuhan as China lifts lockdown,"Tens of thousands of people in Wuhan, the origin point and epicentre for the coronavirus pandemic, travelled out of the sprawling city on Wednesday as China lifted its 76-day lockdown that sealed off around 11 million people in the city, even as health experts warn that the threat of a rebound in infections remains far from over.

Within hours of the lifting of the travel ban, tens of thousands of people wearing masks travelled out of the city as trains, domestic flights and taxis resumed operations, ending the city’s painful isolation due to COVID-19 which was first detected there in December last year.

The Government has lifted the ban on road, air and train travel for all the locals who have acquired health certificates. The easing of travel restrictions came after new infections have been drastically reduced across China, even as the number of fresh COVID-19 cases crossed 1,000 in the country and two new deaths heightened concerns of a rebound in infections.

After barricades were removed at toll gates around Wuhan at Tuesday midnight, vehicles in long lines honked horns and rushed out, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Cars queued up at expressway toll gates and passengers prepared to board trains to leave Wuhan as the megacity started lifting outbound travel restrictions, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Guo Lei, who ran a business in Wuhan, drove his car with six other people aboard to a toll gate at around 8:40 pm (local time) and waited for a homebound trip.

“I can’t wait returning to my hometown,” said Guo, a native of east China’s Shandong Province. “I have lived in Wuhan for eight years. During the Spring Festival holiday, my relatives came to the city and helped me deliver goods. We were all stranded here due to the epidemic,” Guo said.

Shortly after midnight at Wuchang Railway Station, more than 400 passengers jumped on a train heading for Guangzhou in the south, the first train that left Wuhan after the lockdown was lifted. More than 55,000 passengers were expected to leave Wuhan by train on Wednesday.

Xinhua said there would be around 200 flights on Wednesday. A China Eastern airlines flight to the Phoenix International Airport in Sanya, south China’s Hainan Province, was the first flight flying from Wuhan after the outbound travel restrictions were lifted on Wednesday. On January 23, Wuhan declared unprecedented traffic restrictions, including suspending the city’s public transport and all outbound flights and trains.

The prisoner release is a critical first step to intra-Afghan negotiations aimed at bringing an end to decades of war in Afghanistan. The US-Taliban deal signed in February also calls for the Taliban to free 1,000 Government personnel they hold hostage.

Jawed Faisal, spokesman for Afghanistan’s National Security adviser, said the 100 were released from the base in Bagram, near Kabul, on Wednesday.

Taliban political spokesman Suhail Shaheen in a message to The Associated Press said the insurgent group doesn’t know who they are releasing without verification.

He said the Taliban withdrew a technical team to oversee the releases because of delays by the Government.

In a tweet, Shaheen admonished the government for refusing to release the first 15 Taliban they requested and who were on the list.

Meanwhile, in recent days Washington has expressed its frustration with the political turmoil in Kabul as President Ashraf Ghani and his rival in last year’s presidential polls squabble over power sharing amid allegations of election fraud.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/afghanistan-frees-100-taliban--but-group-hasn---t-verified.html

157,09-4-20,Sanders drops out of White House race,"Senator Bernie Sanders on Wednesday dropped out of the White House race, paving the way for former vice president Joe Biden to become the presumptive nominee of the Democratic party and take on President Donald Trump in November presidential elections.

“Today I am suspending my campaign. But while the campaign ends, the struggle for justice continues on,” Sanders, 78, said. The announcement from the Vermont Senator was expected as he had not done well in the recent Democratic primaries against Biden, 77, who has now taken a substantial lead over him after winning a series of key Democratic presidential primaries.

Sanders is scheduled to address his supporters shortly.

“Sanders’s withdrawal from the race concludes a quest for the White House that began five years ago in relative obscurity but ultimately elevated him as a champion of the working class, a standard-bearer of American liberalism and the leader of a self-styled political revolution,” The New York Times commented.

Reacting to the development, President Trump thanked Senator Elizabeth Warren for Sanders dropping out of the presidential race.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/sanders-drops-out-of-white-house-race.html
158,09-4-20,‘Wuhan Virus’ No More,"Suddenly, it’s no longer the “Wuhan virus.”

The United States and China have reached a truce in a vitriolic feud over the coronavirus pandemic, with the two powers each seeing at least a tactical interest in cooling down.

President Donald Trump, hardly known for the delicacy of his word choices, has dropped his provocative term “Chinese virus” and held back from criticising Beijing’s response since a telephone call, on March 26 US time, with his counterpart Xi Jinping. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — who so insisted on saying “Wuhan virus” that the Group of Seven foreign ministers could not issue a joint statement — has been talking of cooperation. “We know that this is a global pandemic, and this is the time for every country to work together to resolve that,” Pompeo said..

Beijing infuriated the United States last month when a foreign ministry spokesman spread a conspiracy theory that US troops brought the virus to Wuhan. Cui Tiankai, China’s gentlemanly ambassador to Washington, struck a highly different tone in an op-ed in The New York Times in which he spoke of his affection for Americans and promised China would do “whatever it can to support the United States.”

State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus welcomed Cui’s remarks but called, civilly, on China to share virus data and allow free speech. “True cooperation requires transparency and real actions, not just rhetoric,” she said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/---wuhan-virus----no-more.html
159,09-4-20,UN health agency on defensive after Trump slams it on virus,"The World Health Organization was on the defensive Wednesday after US President Donald Trump blasted the UN health body over its recommendations on the coronavirus and threatened to strip hundreds of millions of dollars that had come from its top single donor. Some African leaders rallied around the WHO’s Ethiopian-born director-general, and the agency’s Europe chief insisted a worldwide public health crisis was no time to reduce the budget of the entity working to coordinate an often-disjointed international response.

“We’re now still in an acute phase of the pandemic. This is not the time to cut back on funding,” Dr. Hans Kluge told reporters, but ignored a question about whether European nations could help mop up any funding gaps.

The United States contributed nearly $900 million to the World Health Organization’s budget for 2018-2019, according to information on the agency’s website, an amount that represented one-fifth of the WHO’s total $4.4 billion budget for those years.

The U.S. gave nearly three-fourths of the funds in “specified voluntary contributions” and the rest in “assessed” funding as part of Washington’s commitment to U.N. institutions.

A more detailed WHO budget document provided by the U.S. mission in Geneva showed the United States provided $452 million in 2019, including nearly $119 million in assessed funding. In its most recent budget proposal from February, the Trump administration called for slashing the U.S. contribution to the WHO to $57.9 million. At a White House news conference on Tuesday, Trump chided the agency for what he called “China-centric” leanings and said the WHO had “missed the call” on the coronavirus pandemic, notably by advising against travel bans to places like China. Trump initially said the U.S. would “put a hold” on funding for the WHO, and then revised that to say, “We will look at ending funding.”

Some U.S. lawmakers demanded that WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus resign in order to ensure U.S. funding for the agency.

Asked Wednesday at the WHO’s daily briefing in Geneva about the criticism from the U.S., Tedros declined to directly address the issue.

“I don’t think that’s necessary,” he said. “We shouldn’t waste time pointing fingers. We need time to unite. ... Let’s unite. ... The worst is yet to come if we don’t rush to ensure the unity.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/un-health-agency-on-defensive-after-trump-slams-it-on-virus.html
160,09-4-20,"France, Germany face historic economic declines","Germany and France, the EU’s two largest economies, are bracing for a painful recession as the coronavirus pandemic slashes output to the lowest levels in decades, forecasts said on Wednesday.

Gross domestic product in export powerhouse Germany is expected to shrink by nearly 10 per cent in the second quarter as shutdowns aimed at slowing the outbreak paralyse the global economy, the country’s leading research institutes said in a report.

Germany’s second-quarter plunge in GDP should be twice as big as any during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and would mark the steepest fall since the institutes’ records began in 1970.

“The corona pandemic will trigger a serious recession in Germany,” the six institutes including Ifo, DIW and RWI said, estimating that the economy already contracted by 1.9 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter.

France is already in a technical recession, the Bank of France said, after official data showed the economy shrank 0.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2019, and current estimates suggest it contracted around six percent in the first three months of 2020.

The Department of Telecom has allowed service providers to self certify compliance in 30 days after commissioning of new mobile towers or upgrading existing units.

“In case of new BTS, the due date of submission of self-certificate shall be 30 days after the date of commissioning of BTS. In case of upgradation, the due date of submission of self-certificate shall be 30 days,” DoT said in a letter to telecom operators.

Telecom operators are required to submit a self-certificate before commissioning of new mobile towers for which their representatives have to make field-visits and conduct outdoor surveys for radiation measurements, panoramic photographs etc.

Industry body COAI has written to the DoT for relaxation of norms as it is not practical for their employees to visit mobile tower sites for radiation survey and broadband measurements due to the ongoing lockdown.

163,09-4-20,Global trade will plunge by up to a third in 2020 amid pandemic: WTO,"Global trade growth is expected to plummet by up to a third in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, the World Trade Organisation said on Wednesday, warning that the numbers would be “ugly”.

“World trade is expected to fall by between 13 percent and 32 per cent in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupts normal economic activity and life around the world,” the WTO said in a statement.

There were a wide range of possibilities for how trade would be hit by the “unprecedented” health crisis, it added.

However, WTO chief Roberto Azevedo warned the downturn “may well be the deepest economic recession or downturn of our lifetimes”.

In its main annual forecast, the 164-member WTO pointed out that trade had already been slowing in 2019, before the emergence of the novel coronavirus.

But the virus has now infected some 1.4 million people since late last year, killing more than 80,000 and forcing Governments across the world to take radical measures.

More than half of humanity has been asked to stay at home and economic activity has ground to a virtual standstill in many places. Global trade, already hit by trade tensions and uncertainties around Brexit, is expected to register “double-digit declines in trade volumes” in nearly all regions this year, the WTO said.

“This crisis is first and foremost a health crisis which has forced Governments to take unprecedented measures to protect people’s lives,” Azevedo said in a statement.

“The unavoidable declines in trade and output will have painful consequences for households and businesses, on top of the human suffering caused by the disease itself,” he said. Before the current crisis, trade tensions, uncertainty and slowing economic growth weighed on global merchandise trade, which registered a slight decline of 0.1 per cent in 2019 after rising 2.9 per cent a year earlier. The dollar value of world merchandise exports fell by three per cent to USD 8.89 trillion, the WTO said.

World commercial services trade fared better last year, with exports in dollar terms rising by two percent to $6.03 trillion, but the expansion was far slower than in 2018, when services trade increased by nine percent, said the WTO.

But the situation has taken a dramatic turn since the new coronavirus first emerged in China late last year. The WTO said that while the global shock might invite comparisons to the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the situation now was worse.

“Restrictions on movement and social distancing to slow the spread of the disease mean that labour supply, transport and travel are today directly affected in ways they were

not during the financial crisis,” it said.

“Whole sectors of national economies have been shut down, including hotels, restaurants, non-essential retail trade, tourism and significant shares of manufacturing.”

Developments remained very uncertain, said the WTO. An optimistic outlook posits that a sharp drop in trade will be followed by a recovery starting in the second half of 2020, said the organisation.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/global-trade-will-plunge-by-up-to-a-third-in-2020-amid-pandemic--wto-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/global-trade-will-plunge-by-up-to-a-third-in-2020-amid-pandemic--wto.html

Actor Farhan Akhtar revealed that for the role in his next film, Toofaan, he saw “a major body transformation.”

After losing some weight, he again had to put on 15 kgs in six weeks.

Farhan said, “For me, fitness is a way of life and not just a routine. Irrespective of my craft, I choose to live a healthy lifestyle. I’ve always refrained from indulging in things that could have adverse effects on my body. It was a challenge for me to adapt to a way of living that was completely contrary — with monitored exercise, less physical activity and high consumption of fats, carbs. It was tough. But I balanced consumption of fried food and the fats made up for it.”

Toofaan also stars Mrunal Thakur and Paresh Rawal.

‘As starkids, we do get a lot of advantages. So we know about the trade off. If you get those benefits, then you must be prepared for the extra scrutiny and pressure. My father (Paresh Rawal) is such an amazing actor and he’s had so much success that I am not afraid of people comparing me to him because I know I’m nowhere close.’

Actor Ali Fazal is set to play a lover boy in his next music video, Aaj Bhi. Brought by Vishal Mishra, the song is helmed by Mirzapur creator Gurmmeet Singh for Vryl Originals.

Talking about the track, Ali says, “It’s the first time I am working with Surbhi. It’s been super interesting. I loved interacting with Vishal. He has such a mesmerising voice.

169,09-4-20,Home or classroom?,"Distance learning poses challenges for students, teachers

Students and teachers at all levels of education are transitioning from classroom to computer as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continues to rise. Not every subject lends itself to a smooth transition to distance learning, as students and instructors have discovered.

“I think we’re all really frustrated,” said Jordyn Wade, a fashion design major at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. “But we know that our professors are doing what they can in a really unprecedented situation.”

Wade said that she and her classmates are now meeting remotely through Zoom, a video conferencing platform. Zoom allows students to meet virtually during a time when people can’t meet physically, but distance learning poses challenges for courses that require more than a lecture, like art classes and lab components of science classes.

Students like Wade worked mostly with industrial grade equipment. “We kind of rely heavily on the school for supplies like sewing machines and the industrial equipment that can cost thousands of dollars,” Wade said. “Now we just stare at each other and they ask us, ‘What can you guys do? Can you hand sew an entire jacket before the end of the month?’”

Wade said that one of the most frustrating aspects of distance learning is not being able to receive direct feedback from professors. “We can’t ask our professors what’s wrong with the garment that we’re making, we can just send them pictures and hope they can figure it out from afar,” Wade said.

Chloe Pallak, a student in VCU’s art program said that many of her projects are being graded on whether or not they are complete. “To get a grade for an assignment, you just have to do it,” Pallak said. “It really takes away the motivation of wanting to make art and not just complete the assignment.”

Courses that include lab components, such as classes in environmental science, also face challenges as classes move online. Griffin Erney, an environmental studies major at VCU, said that distance learning prevents students from accessing lab materials that are typically provided in the classroom.

“Before the class was online we would just do different activities and be provided with the materials,” Erney said. “Having labs online is more challenging, on top of all the work that we already have.”

Davide D’Urbino, a chemistry and organic chemistry teacher at Clover Hill High School in Chesterfield County, said he plans on using computer applications to supplement labs that cannot be completed in the classroom. He said the school division requested that teachers hold off on introducing new learning material.

“The expectation was that you could teach new stuff, but then you have to go back in class and reteach it,” D’Urbino said and added that teachers aren’t allowed to teach new material online because some students may not have internet access. He said he understands why the school division has placed these restrictions but said it “feels weird.”

Distance learning has also presented challenges to teachers trying to adapt to lecturing online.

“Some people say teaching is 75 percent theater, you just go out there and do improv. You can’t really do that online,” D’Urbino said. “It’s very difficult to intervene and correct course if you realise something isn’t quite working out.”

Teachers have also scrambled for ways to continue instruction for students that lack access to the internet.

Janice Barton, a 5th grade science teacher at Honaker Elementary School in Russell County, said that about half of the 60 students she teaches have access to the internet. She said the school is using Google Classroom, a web platform that allows teachers to share files with students through the internet. For students without internet access, teachers create physical packets of learning content.

“We’re working as grade levels, we’re going in and working together to put the packets together,” Barton said. “We have pickup days and drop-off days, and that’s how we are working and dealing with this right now.”

Barton said the school uses phone calls, emails, and the app Remind, which allows teachers to send messages to students to keep in contact with parents and students.

While local school divisions are tasked with making decisions on how to pursue distance learning, the Virginia Department of Education issued guidance to help divisions continue instruction.

VDOE’s guidance to local school divisions includes offering instruction during the summer of 2020, extending the school term or adjusting the next, and adding learning modules to extended school calendars.

Superintendent of Public Instruction James Lane issued guidance regarding eight high school senior graduation requirements and will be issuing further guidance for half of those, which can not be waived outright.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/home-or-classroom--2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/home-or-classroom-.html

171,09-4-20,SAIL records highest production and growth,"Maintaining its thrust on meeting Indian Railway’s requirement of 260 metre long rail panels, SAIL-Bhilai Steel Plant has recorded a remarkable growth of 42 per cent in the production. Anil Kumar Chaudhary, chairman of SAIL, commented, “SAIL is committed to fulfill the requirements of Indian Railways. SAIL and Indian Railways share a synergy of more than sixty years. We are continuously ramping up our production of rails.” The 260 metre rail panels provide significant advantage of lesser number of welded joints in the tracks thereby improving safety and increasing speed. During the same period, a substantial growth of 30 per cent has also been achieved in overall production of prime rails.

SAIL-BSP has been producing world-class rails for Indian Railways for more than six decades from its Rail and Structural Mill (RSM) and the new and modern Universal Rail Mill (URM) that has been rolling out the world’s longest 130 metre rail as single piece.

175,09-4-20,New York sees highest death toll for 2nd day,"New York, for the second consecutive day, recorded the highest single day death toll with 779 people succumbing to COVID19, “a terrible news”, Governor Andrew Cuomo said, warning that the number will continue to rise even as the state is “now bending the curve” through the rigorous social distancing measures.

“The bad news isn’t just bad. The bad news is actually terrible. Highest single day death toll yet (of) 779 people. When you look at the numbers on the death toll, it has been going steadily up and it reached the new height,” Cuomo said in his daily Coronavirus briefing on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, the state had hit a new one-day peak, with 731 people dead in the largest single-day increase in deaths since the coronavirus crisis engulfed New York, the epicentre of the pandemic.

Within a 24 hour period, 779 more people died due to COVID-19.

The New York death toll from COVID-19 surpassed the number of people who died in the 9/11 attacks, Cuomo said, adding that 2,753 lives were lost in the terror attacks and the coronavirus crisis has claimed the lives of 6,268 New Yorkers.

Describing coronavirus as “a vicious predator of a virus” that targeted the vulnerable from day one, Cuomo said, “The number of deaths will continue to rise as those hospitalized for a longer period of time pass away. The longer you are on a ventilator, the less likely you will come off the ventilator.”

All flags in the state will be flown at half mass in honour of those who have died because of the virus.

The Governor said he has “mixed emotions” as he addresses the COVID19 situation in the state which continues to see high death rates but is also seeing a flattening of the curve as number of hospitalizations continues to go down and hospitals are reporting that they are discharging more people than before.

“There is good news in what we’re saying what we have done and what we are doing is actually working and making a difference,” he said, emphasising that social distancing measures such as schools and non-essential businesses closure are working.

“It is flattening the curve. That curve is flattening because we are flattening the curve by what we are doing. If we stop what we are doing, you will see that curve change. That curve is purely a function of what we do day in and day out.”

Cuomo said if the hospitalisation rate keeps decreasing the way it is now, then the system should stabilize over these next couple of weeks, which will minimise the need for overflow on the system.

“So that is all good news. There’s a big caution sign that if we continue doing what we do, we are flattening the curve because we are rigorous about social distancing. If we continue doing what we’re doing, then we believe the curve will continue to flat.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/new-york-sees-highest-death-toll-for-2nd-day.html
176,09-4-20,"Italy, Spain ICU pressures decline, but emotional toll rises","Maddalena Ferrari lets herself cry when she takes off the surgical mask she wears even at home to protect her elderly parents from the coronavirus that surrounds her at work in one of Italy’s hardest-hit intensive care units.

In the privacy of her own bedroom, where no one can see, the nursing coordinator peels away the mask that both protects her and hides her, and weeps for all the patients lost that day at Bergamo’s Pope John XXIII Hospital.

“We’re losing an entire generation,” Ferrari said at the end of one of her shifts. “They still had so much to teach us.”

The pressures on hospital ICUs in Italy and Spain may have eased in recent days as new virus cases decline. But the emotional and psychological toll the pandemic has taken on the doctors and nurses working there is only now beginning to emerge.

Already, two nurses in Italy have killed themselves, and psychologists have mobilized therapists and online platforms to provide free consultation for medical personnel. Individual hospitals hold small group therapy sessions to help staff cope with the trauma of seeing so much death among patients who are utterly alone.

Seven weeks into Italy’s outbreak, the world’s deadliest, the adrenaline rush that kept medical personnel going at the start has been replaced by crushing fatigue and fear of getting the virus, researchers say. With many doctors and nurses deprived of their normal family support because they are isolating themselves, the mental health of Italy and Spain’s overwhelmed medical personnel is now a focus of their already stressed health care systems.

“The adrenaline factor works for a month, maximum,” said Dr. Alessandro Colombo, director of the health care training academy for the Lombardy region, who is researching the psychological toll of the outbreak on medical personnel. “We are entering the second month, so these people are physically and mentally tired.”

According to his preliminary research, the solitude of the patients has had a grievous impact on doctors and nurses. They are being asked to step in at the bedside of the dying in place of relatives and even priests. The sense of failure among hospital staff, he said, is overwhelming.

“Each time it’s a failure,” said Ferrari, the nursing coordinator at the Bergamo’ hospital. You do everything for the patient, and “at the end, if you’re a believer, there is someone above you who has decided another destiny for that person.”

Her colleague, Maria Berardelli, said medical personnel aren’t used to seeing patients die after two weeks on ventilators, and the emotional toll is devastating.

“This virus is strong. Strong, strong strong,” she said in a Skype interview with Ferrari, both of them in masks. “You cannot get used to it, because every patient has his own story.”

In Italy, the national association of nurses and psychologists asked the government for a coordinated, nationwide response for the mental health care needs of medical personnel, warning the “typical wave of stress disturbances is only going to grow over time.”

178,09-4-20,"Boris Johnson improving, sitting up in bed","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who remains in the intensive care unit at a London hospital with coronavirus infection, is improving and sitting up in bed, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday.

Leading the daily Downing Street briefing, the Indian-origin finance minister gave an update on the prime minister’s health, stressing that Johnson was receiving “excellent care” at the National Health Service (NHS) St. Thomas’ Hospital in London and was “doing well”.

“The latest from the hospital is that the prime minister remains in intensive care where his condition is improving,” Sunak said.

“I can also tell you that he has been sitting up in bed and engaging positively with the clinical team... The Prime Minister is not only my colleague and my boss but also my friend, and my thoughts are with him and his family,” he said, adding that his illness is a reminder how “indiscriminate this disease is”.

The senior Cabinet minister, who is next in line after UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise for Johnson should the need arise during the outbreak, gave the latest figures on the impact of COVID-19 in the UK - which registered another major rise in daily death toll of 938 fatalities to hit 7,097 on Wednesday. He reiterated the government’s advice for the public to continue to follow strict social distancing instructions and admitted that there were some tough times ahead for the economy.

“I can’t stand here and say I will save every single job and every single business. In spite of what are unprecedented measures in scale and scope, I can’t stand here and say I can save every single job, protect every single business or indeed every single charity. That’s just simply not possible,” he said.

The briefing centred around an announcement of a 750-million pounds fund to support the UK’s charities to help them survive through the pandemic as Sunak thanked the sector for “holding together our social fabric”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/boris-johnson-improving--sitting-up-in-bed.html

180,09-4-20,"Indians in Wuhan say strict lockdown, social distancing only ways to contain COVID-19","As the people in China’s Wuhan celebrated the end of the 11-week shutdown imposed to contain coronavirus, some Indians who stayed put in the city enduring the surge of the pandemic has a message for India — lockdown and self-isolation are the only ways to prevent COVID-19 from spreading.

The Indians in Wuhan are jubilant and happy that their over two-month long life-threatening ordeal came to an end on Wednesday. “For over 73 days, I stayed put in my room, stepped out to my lab close by with permission. Today I struggle to speak properly because I have not spoken much all these weeks as there is no one to speak because everyone stayed indoors,” Arunjith T Sathrajith, a hydrobiolgist working in Wuhan, told PTI over phone. India evacuated about 700 Indians and foreigners through two special Air India flights, but Arunjith, who hailed from Kerala, decided to stay put and brave it all because he felt “escaping” from a troubled place is not the ideal thing for “Indians to do”.

He is one of the few Indians who chose to stay back in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people and the epicentre of the pandemic.

He also thought his return to Kerala could endanger his parents and in-laws who are all over 50 years of age besides his wife and child.

A microbiologist-turned-hydrobiologist who is taking part in a research project in the central Chinese city, he said India has done the right thing to go for a nationwide lockdown but the major problem for the country could surface when the monsoon season arises as people’s immunity levels go down.

That is the time virus could turn virulent, Arunjith said. If there is any lesson Wuhan offers, it is the strict lockdown and people’s participation in self-isolation campaign, he said.

Another Indian scientist who also stayed put in Wuhan fully agreed with Arunjith.

“For about 72 days I have shut myself in my room. My neighbour has three very young children. I have not seen them coming out of their flat even once. “Today I am happy and relieved I survived but still not willing to venture out because I could run into virus carriers,” the scientist, who preferred to remain anonymous, said advising Indians to strictly follow the lockdown.

He said that lockdown of Wuhan few days before could have helped prevent the virus from spreading out like wildfire. He preferred to remain in Wuhan and declined the Indian embassy’s offer because he was concerned about his family back home.

“Considering the hospitality I enjoyed, I was confident I would be taken care of by my employer and local friends and they did,” he said. Arunjith said he and his fellow researchers began hearing about the spread of a vicious virus in Wuhan from the second week of December and things progressively began deteriorating with fear spreading among people as they began wearing masks.

But even after the lifting of the lockdown in Wuhan, still not many people are stepping out as there is lingering fear about the asymptomatic cases.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/indians-in-wuhan-say-strict-lockdown--social-distancing-only-ways-to-contain-covid-19.html
181,09-4-20,Look up,"While staying at home could make one feel restless and demotivated, here’s how to stay chic and sane during quarantine — by giving fashion a chance. By Team Viva

Is the lockdown making you anxious and depressed? Is it getting tougher for you to stay put? Well, even though this time is taxing, it could be very rewarding, if you look at it positively. Here are some everyday fashion and lifestyle mantras to stay calm and chic this quarantine month.

Believe it or not, the first step towards feeling better and being more productive is dressing up and changing out of those very comfy pyjamas, believes Nelson Jaffery, head of design, Liva, Birla Cellulose, Aditya Birla Group. He adds, “But yes, this doesn’t mean you have to wear uncomfortable clothes to feel motivated. Light and breathable fabrics are ideal for the warm weather. Viscose and modal are great options as not only do these fabrics offer a great drape, they are also nature-based and sustainable.”

Here are some recommendations by Jaffrey —

Shorts and shirts: We all have stocks of shorts that we barely wear while stepping out except during our workouts and yoga. Wearing shorts not only boosts you to jump and around freely but also gives you great comfort. To make your shorts look more fashionable, you can try and match them with black shirts rather than T-shirts. This will take less effort while at the same time it makes for a striking ensemble. If you wish to go little further, feel free to add accessories like long oxidised earrings.

Palazzo and crop top: The combination has been a favourite and why not? Palazzo is making a comeback in the top trends. While there are many ways for you to style it, pairing a palazzo with crop tops makes it look more attractive while making it ideal for your bedroom zone. In addition to that, wearing a crop top will also motivate you to control your false hunger pangs.

Sweatpants with lightly tuck in T-shirt: Sweatpants were something that you wore not only in bed but while stepping out or to lounge around the house. Along the way they have become the ultimate street style fashion garment, also chosen by top celebrities. You can easily dress with sweatpants and make them look a lot more stylish just by tucking in your favourite T-shirt.

Tunic dress: If you wish to celebrate the pre-spring and merry vibes of being home, then you should definitely choose to wear the tunic dresses which are so cheerful.

Actor Shiny Doshi believes that since there is no reason to go out of the house frequently, the best thing to do is to “stay in casuals.” She says, “During the day time, I’m in my pyjamas and T-shirt because that’s the comfiest outfit that one can wear. Especially, when we are working, cooking or engaged in other household chores. Moreover, hosiery clothes make the heat bearable. I do feel like dressing up too sometimes. But all in all, I’ve spent the lockdown in four of my most comfortable pyjamas.”

Designer Payal Jain suggests, “These are tough times and everyone needs comfort before anything else. Fashion during quarantine or #StayAtHome is all about joggers, hoodies, tracks, T-shirts, tunics and leggings, which can keep you warm, cosy and comfortable throughout the day.”

With ‘work from home’ becoming the new norm, designers and fashion experts also suggest how one can get dressed for conference video calls. Deepak Bansal, director, Cantabil Retail India Ltd, says, “Looking at the current lockdown situation and work from home, the fashion statement has made a shift towards comfort yet professional wear. With summers around the corner, one could get into a pair of lounge pants and match them up with a light linen shirt which would give you a breezy yet appropriate professional look.”

Arindam Chakravorty, brand head, Aurelia, also point out, “Work from home is the new trend which is changing the fashion around the world during this lockdown. For the perfect chic yet professional look, pair a shirt collar kurti or mandarian collar kurti along with cigarette pants or straight pants and look your fabulous best for the team video calls.”

Nivida Kohli, design manager, Numero Uno, says, “It’s important to feel good the whole day for an optimal output. Don’t forget to step out of sleepwear to dress up for that video call frame. Wear a comfortable basic crew neck T-shirt with your favourite lounge denims pants, a must for a healthy working mind from home.

Actor Karanvir Sharma lists his quarantine wardrobe specials, “Wear clothes that you would for work through the day. It makes you feel active. I’m now cooking often. So I wear bright casuals with an apron. The best casual wear for me through the day is a white T-shirt with blue denims. You can pull out a flowing casual shirt too. It never goes out of fashion. Saturday nights are for quarantine parties, where I connect with all my friends through Zoom. So I usually wear dark clothes for that.”

Actor Rati Pandey, who recently took to social media to show that gardening could be one of the healthiest activities to do while staying in, says that even though lockdowns might make one feel stagnant spending weeks indoors, “but staying indoors doesn’t have to mean being static.” Here are some tips she gives:",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/look-up-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/look-up.html

“The New Zealand tour was one of the best times of my life. Yes, it is true that I could not perform with the bat the way I would have loved to.

184,09-4-20,Akhtar proposes Indo-Pak series to raise funds,"Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar on Wednesday proposed a made-for-television three-match ODI series against arch-rivals India to raise funds for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in both the countries.

The two nations have not played a full-series since 2007 due to the terrorist attacks on India by Pakistan-based outfits and the resultant diplomatic tension. They only play each other in ICC events and Asia Cup.

“In this time of crisis, I want to propose a three match series in which for the first time, the people of neither country would be upset at the outcome of the games,” Akhtar said.

“If Virat (Kohli) scores a hundred, we will be happy, if Babar Azam scores a hundred, you will be happy. Both teams will be winners irrespective of whatever happens on the field,” he said.

Akhtar said the matches could be a closed-door affair.

“It can be a TV only affair. Since everyone will be watching at home, you are bound to get massive viewership for the games. For the first time, both countries will play for each other. And whatever funds are generated through this can be donated equally to the government of India and Pakistan to fight this pandemic,” added the 44-year-old.

With both countries in a lockdown amid the fast-spreading pandemic, the games can only be organised when things improve. However, Akhtar feels the sooner they are held, the better it would be but could not tell how the logistics of such an initiative would be worked out.

“Everyone is sitting at home at the moment, so there will be a massive following for the games. May be not now, when things start improving, the games could be organised at a neutral location like Dubai.

“It could even lead to resumption of bilateral cricketing ties and relations of both countries improve diplomatically. You never know,” said the Rawalpindi Express.

“The whole world will tune into it, so much money can be raised to deal with this crisis. In difficult times, the character of the nation comes forward.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/akhtar-proposes-indo-pak-series-to-raise-funds.html

2022 athletics worlds set for July 15-24

Paris: The world athletics championships originally scheduled for next year in Eugene, Oregon, will take place July 15-24 in 2022, avoiding a potential clash with the CWG in Birmingham. World Athletics last month shifted the event to 2022 to accommodate the rearranged Tokyo Olympics, which were postponed by a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. “The World Athletics Council approved the new dates this week after extensive discussions with the sport's stakeholders including organisers of two other major championships due to take place in July-August 2022, the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games and the multisport European Championships in Munich,” World Athletics said in a statement on Wednesday.

IOC release Tokyo qualification principles

Dutch plan league resumption on June 19

The Hague: Dutch football federation has said that it was hoping the top two divisions would restart on June 19 following their suspension due to Covid-19 pandemic. The decision would keep the Dutch league in line with UEFA, which has warned teams risk exclusion from the next CL if their domestic competitions are ended prematurely.

188,09-4-20,Eight-month suspension of Oly qualification period big blow for Indian athletes,"World Athletics’ decision to suspend the Olympic qualification period till end of November has dealt a huge blow to Indian track-and-field competitors aiming for Tokyo, who were hoping to make the cut through domestic meets tentatively scheduled later this year.

World Athletics on Tuesday suspended the qualification period for the Tokyo Games from April 6 to November 30, 2020, following consultation with its Athletes’ Commission, continental association presidents and the Council.

During this period, results achieved at any competition will not be considered for Tokyo Games entry standards or world rankings, the publication of which will also be suspended.

India’s Deputy chief national coach Radhakrishnan Nair the decision would disappoint many Indian athletes.

“World Athletics decision will be a big blow for the likes of Tejinder Pal Singh Toor (shot put), Anu Rani (javelin throw), M Sreeshankar (long jump) and sprinter Dutee Chand,” Nair said from NIS-Patiala.

Star sprinter Hima Das is also yet to qualify for the Tokyo Games.

Olympic medal hopeful Neeraj Chopra, his javelin throw team-mate Shivpal Singh, the mixed 4x400m relay team, K T Irfan (men’s 20km race walk), Bhawna Jat (women’s 20km race walk) and Avinash sable (3000m steeplechase) have already qualified for the Tokyo Games.

The world body has said those athletes who have already met the Olympic entry standard since the start of the qualification period in 2019 will remain qualified.

Asked what could have been the rationale behind the World Athletics’ decision to freeze the qualification period till the end of November, Nair said, “I think many countries are not sure when the COVID-19 situation will be alright and can start training.

“Moreover, it is not fare to give athletes almost two years as qualifying period.”

The qualifying period for most of the events, barring long distance races and race walk, began in May 2019 and was to end in June this year.

But after the Olympics was pushed to 2021 due to the pandemic, the qualification period will now resume from December 1, 2020 until June 29, 2021.

Nair said the Athletics Federation of India is hoping to hold the National Inter-State Championships and National Open in September and October but the performance of the athletes may not exactly be the best as they will not be counted for the Olympics qualification.

“What to do? We cannot do anything. We will be conducting the Nationals in September and October if the situation improves,” said Nair, one of the most qualified coaches in the country.

World Athletics said the results in the intervening period of April 6 and November 30, 2020 will continue to be recorded for statistical purposes, including for world records, subject to the applicable conditions.

But they will not be used to establish an athlete’s qualification status for the Olympics.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/eight-month-suspension-of-oly-qualification-period-big-blow-for-indian-athletes.html
189,09-4-20,Smith wants to win Test series in India,"Star Australian batsman Steve Smith believes India is one of the toughest places to play Test cricket and winning a five-day format series in the country is a major career goal for him.

“I would love to win a Test series in India,” Smith told New Zealand leg-spinner Ish Sodhi during a podcast organised by inaugural IPL champions Rajasthan Royals.

“I think as an Australian cricketer we talk about like Ashes is always big, World Cup is big but I think now India is No 1 team in the world and it is a very difficult place to play Test cricket, so I would love to win a series there,” he said.

Talking about his other targets, Smith, who is currently the world’s number one Test batsman, said: “Other then that I would not like to set too many goals, but take things day by day, series by series, just try to improve.

“It has been a pretty long year with the World Cup and Ashes, a few away one day tours. So this rest is not the worst thing but hopefully it is for a few weeks. I am pretty keen to get back to playing.”

Smith also heaped praise on India’s spin all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, describing him as a difficult bowler to face in the subcontinent.

“Jadeja in the sub-continent... Why he is so good because, he hits that good length and one ball skids on and one spins, and it just all looks same out of the hand. I think consistency in length is key and then having at least one variation,” he said.

“So, I think for a leg-spinner, having a good googly, or a slider is crucial and for fingers spinners, being able to change the pace without changing the arms speed too much. I reckon there a few around the world who do that, Jadeja is one of them. He is very difficult to play.”

Smith took over the captaincy from Ajinkya Rahane mid-season in the last edition of the IPL and he is keen to lead the Rajasthan Royals from the beginning if the cash-rich event, which has been suspended till April 15, is held later in the year.

“Plenty going on in the world at present, but hopefully we can get an IPL at some stage,” said Smith, who has so far amassed 7227 runs in 73 Tests and 4162 runs in ODIs.

“The two seasons that I captained the Royals were both half seasons, Shane Watson gave me the captaincy in 2015 and then last year out of the blue, I took over at the back end of the season. Looking at having a crack at it full time and the Royals have a pretty good squad,” he said.

Smith started his career as a spinner before emerging as one of the best batsmen in the world.

Talking about his career, the 30-year-old said: “I was more of a batsman than a bowler. I played my first two Test matches as a specialist spinner which was strange. They were looking for a spinner after the Shane Warne era and I was one of the 12-13 spinners that got a go.

“I got dropped after that and for me it was about finding a way to get into Australian team and at that point of time I let my bowling slip and focussed only on my batting. But I bowl every now and then.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/smith-wants-to-win-test-series-in-india-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/smith-wants-to-win-test-series-in-india.html

192,09-4-20,Vedic remedy,"After the destruction of the world, god is said to have created the universe and simultaneously gave the knowledge of four Vedas to four rishis. It was important because in the absence of vedic knowledge, human beings would remain ignorant.

The first mantra of Rigved is: “Agnimeedy Purohitam.” It says that a person should want to worship god and must remember him before doing anything in life because he destroys all the sorrows, problems and diseases.

Vedas are the invaluable treasure of education of every worldly subject. This is why, medical science is also a part and parcel of vedic knowledge.

Atharvaved mantra 2/9/5 preaches that god is the creator and he nurses us. So he is empowered to destroy all the diseases and is said “Su Bhishaktamaha” i.e. the best doctor. This is why doctors tell the relatives of highly critical patients that they have done their best, rest lies in the hands of god. In view of the above, the destruction of the Coronavirus also remains in the hands of the almighty to an extent.

Vedas preach that the base of human life is brahmacharya. So, Atharvaved mantra 8/5/2 preaches that when a person maintains firm brahmacharya, then strength is generated in his body which kills all the microbes that cause diseases. Further, Atharvaved mantras 8/5/10, 11, 12 preach that brahmacharya generates the best medicine within the body to kill all types of disease causing germs. So the virus cannot affect anyone who maintains brahmacharya. But in the absence of vedic knowledge, brahmacharya cannot be maintained

In previous yugas, everyone used to follow brahmacharya, perform daily Yajyen/agnihotra, which purified the air, water and food. If we consider Yajurved mantra 1/1, it says that if we practise agnihotra/Yajyen daily, then all the infectious diseases can be destroyed.

Mantra 1/2 gives full assurance that agnihotra/Yajyen purifies the air and thus, destroys pollution. Therefore, it becomes hard for the virus to exist. But to our bad luck, unlike previous yugas, people are not aware of the vedic knowledge and as a result are unable to help themselves from various serious diseases.

The idea of vedic knowledge is that if public makes learns vedas, including performing daily agnihotra/Yajyen with ved mantras, from learned acharya there will not be any kind of disease as Yajyen purifies the universe. It is called the best deed of the world.

In this mantra, the almighty preaches/orders the learned people to perform Yajyen daily. We have oversighted the eternal knowledge of Vedas. This will lead to several diseases. Vedas preach that the best deed for benevolence of all beings is the performance of daily agnihotra/Yajyen. (Yajurved mantra 1/2 refers)

See, what a wonderful knowledge exists in Yajurved mantra 1/3 that the Yajyen holds the world, purifies the universe and preaches about the almighty.

It is very important for the leaders of the nation to learn vedas and perform daily agnihotra/Yajyen. Despite of various efforts by the medical authorities the world could not get a cure for Corona.

193,09-4-20,"Excited to see how Yashasvi, Parag perform in IPL 13: Smith","Rajasthan Royals captain Steve Smith is looking forward to how the younger players in the squad, particularly all-rounder Riyan Parag and batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal, perform in the 2020 season of the IPL.

Riyan was 17-year-old when he made his IPL debut with the Royals last year and Smith said that he was very much impressed with the freedom with which he batted and recalled the time when he almost dismissed MS Dhoni.

“Young 17-year-old kid carrying around his teddy bears. He copped a bit but when he went out to play he did it with such freedom and even won a few games with his own bat. Pretty special, I could just see the joy on his face,” Smith said in an interaction with Ish Sodhi on the franchise’s Facebook page.

“He was bowling to MS Dhoni and almost got him out and just the smile on his face when he was bowling was so cool. We’ve been very lucky to have some good young players.”

Smith said that he is also excited to see how Jaiswal would do if and when the season starts. Jaiswal went into the U19 World Cup last year with a lot of hype around him due to his record breaking double-ton in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. He ended up taking the World Cup by storm and was the highest scorer in the tournament.

“Jaiswal, he was the top scorer at the U19s and looks a quality player. So, fingers crossed we can get over this year and see all that young talent close up again,” said Smith.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/excited-to-see-how-yashasvi--parag-perform-in-ipl-13--smith.html
194,09-4-20,IPL possible if normalcy returns by Oct: Nehra,"Former India left-arm pacer Ashish Nehra believes there is a possibility of the IPL taking place in the last quarter of the year, provided the COVID-19 pandemic is brought under control worldwide by the month of October.

The IPL 2020 edition has been suspended till April 15 with no clarity yet on whether it would go ahead at all.

“Even if the IPL doesn’t happen in August, (because) there are a lot of places in India that witness rains during that month and there are high chances that lots of matches will get cancelled,” Nehra told on Star Sports 1 Hindi show Cricket Connected.

“If things go back to normal around the world by October, we’ll have a 100 per cent clearance,” he reckoned.

With the spike in coronavirus cases and deaths showing no signs of relenting across the world, there are slim chances of the IPL happening this year.

Meanwhile, Nehra feels former star all-aounder Yuvraj Singh has always excelled while playing under Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s captaincy.

“Yuvraj has played well under MS Dhoni, as far as I have seen Yuvraj’s career, the way he has batted in 2007 and 2008 onwards it has been impeccable and in 2011 we saw how he braved his sickness and played brilliantly under Dhoni.

“I feel every player has their own choice of a favourite captain when they play for 16 years and Yuvraj played well under Dhoni according to me,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ipl-possible-if-normalcy-returns-by-oct--nehra.html
195,09-4-20,Stokes is Wisden Cricketer of the year,"Swashbuckling England all-rounder, Ben Stokes has ended India skipper Virat Kohli’s three-year run as Wisden’s leading cricketer of the year after being named for the honour on the back of his stellar show in 2019.

The 2020 Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack also coronated Ellyse Perry as leading women’s cricketer of the year as the Australian reclaimed the title from India’s Smriti Mandhana.

Stokes is the first Englishman to receive the honour since former captain Andrew Flintoff in 2005.

Stokes propelled England to their maiden World title last year with a man-of-the-match performance in the final against New Zealand at Lord’s.

He then followed it up with a remarkable match-winning unbeaten innings of 135 in the third Ashes Test against Australia.

The 28-year-old, who succeeds Kohli, amassed 821 Test runs and scored 719 in ODI’s in 2019.

“Ben Stokes pulled off the performance of a lifetime — twice in the space of a few weeks,” said Wisden’s editor, Lawrence Booth was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.

“First, with a mixture of outrageous talent and good fortune, he rescued England’s run-chase in the World Cup final, before helping to hit 15 off the super over. Then, in the Third Ashes Test at Headingley, he produced one of the great innings, smashing an unbeaten 135 to pinch a one-wicket win.”

Australia all-rounder Perry bagged the honour for her splendid Ashes show.

“Ellyse Perry dominated the women’s Ashes like no one before her inspiring Australia to a crushing victory. She was devastating with the ball, claiming seven for 22 in the ODI at Canterbury, and remorseless with the bat, not least during the one-off Test at Taunton, where she made 116 and 76 not out.”

England pacer Jofra Archer, Australians Pat Cummins, Marnus Labuschagne and Perry and Essex’s player Simon Harmer were picked as the five Wisden Cricketers of the year.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/stokes-is-wisden-cricketer-of-the-year.html
196,09-4-20,Deepak gets more time to recover after IPL postponement,"The postponement of IPL 2020 has come as a blessing in disguise for India medium pacer Deepak Chahar as the delay has given him time to regain full fitness from his lower-back injury.

Chahar, who plays for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL, is now eagerly waiting to make his return to competitive cricket once the situation normalises.

“I am looking forward to bowling again. For now, the idea is to stay fit,” the 27-year-old said.

Chahar sustained a stress fracture on his lower back midway through the ODI series against the West Indies in December last year, which ruled him out of action until the end of March.

He admitted that he would have missed CSK’s first few games if the IPL 2020 had started as scheduled on March 29.

“When things are not in your control, there is little you can do. So, I focus on what I can do during that time. I am trying to learn new things, focus on my fitness — as you know I was injured and getting back. This gives me more time to recover,” he was quoted as saying on CSK’s official website.

“Had the IPL season started on time, I would have missed the first few matches,” said Chahar, whose 6 for 7 against Bangladesh last year was declared the ICC T20I performance of the year.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/deepak-gets-more-time-to-recover-after-ipl-postponement.html

""Bartomeu called me and told me he wanted to change the management because he was suspicious of some of the directors, me included,"" Rousaud, who had been tipped to succeed Bartomeu as president, told Cadena Ser radio on Wednesday.

""He told me things had been leaked to the press that upset the players and he thought I had been critical of how the board had handled it.""

The relationship between Barca's players and board has been strained for several months, with Lionel Messi's public criticism of technical secretary Eric Abidal in February just one of a number of off-field controversies.

Messi took another swipe at the Barca board last week, when confirming the squad would take a 70 percent pay cut during the coronavirus crisis.

The Argentine accused Bartomeu of undermining the players during recent negotiations.

""It never ceases to amaze us that from within the club there were those who tried to put us under the magnifying glass and tried to add pressure to do something that we always knew we would do,"" Messi wrote on social media.

Messi's message was soon posted on the pages of nearly all of his Barcelona teammates.

The controversy further increased the pressure on Bartomeu and the Barcelona board ahead of presidential elections due next year.

However, Bartomeu will not be eligible to run for re-election in 2021 having served two terms.

According to Catalan daily Sport, in addition to Rousaud, Bartomeu is also looking to replace club treasurer Enrique Tombas, reserve team director and spokesperson Silvio Elias and Josep Pont, who oversees commercial operations.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/barcelona-president-seeks-reshuffle-of-club-board-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/barcelona-president-seeks-reshuffle-of-club-board.html
198,09-4-20,"PM, Opp concur on more lockdown","Nationwide lockdown won’t be lifted in one go: Modi

With six days to go before the three-week lockdown to end, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Opposition leaders on Wednesday were on the same page for the staged withdrawal of it to contain coronavirus.

The Opposition also asked the Centre to make Covid-19 testing free and demanded availability of quality personal protective kits (PPE) as well as additional stimulus for farmers for the upcoming crop season.

In the first formal interaction through video-conferencing with the floor leaders of the Opposition parties since the lockdown announced by him in the midnight of March 25, Modi told them and other parties in Parliament that the nationwide lockdown will not be lifted in one go on April 14 as scheduled earlier.

Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader Pinaki Misra, who represented his party at the meeting, said that Prime Minister Modi made it clear that lockdown will not be lifted and also that the life at pre-corona and post-corona stage will not be same.

Stating that Government’s main priority is saving each and every life, Modi, according to sources, maintained that the situation in the country is akin to a ‘social emergency’ which has necessitated tough decisions and there was a need for continued vigilance. The Prime Minister also observed that the present situation was a watershed event in mankind’s history.

“We must evolve to counter its impact,” he said, adding in the changing circumstances, the country should simultaneously try to bring about a change in its work culture and working style.

Modi understood to have told the conference that “country is facing serious economic challenges as a result of the pandemic” and Government will do all to overcome them.

The Prime Minister is to interact with all the Chief Ministers on April 11 to review the situation emerging of the lockdown. Modi told Opposition leaders that he was in regular touch with the Chief Ministers and taking their suggestions.

Several Chief Ministers and Opposition leaders have already expressed themselves against unlocking the country after April 14 with Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot even suggesting that other States could adopt the “Bhilwara model” of lockdown which had successfully eliminated coronavirus in the Bhilwara district of the State by stringent lockdown measure after odd-25 cases emerged there later last month.

General view has been that post-April 14 measures would vary from State to State keeping in view the number and degree of ‘hotspots’ they have by the end of the next week.

Speaking to the Prime Minister, most of the Opposition parties demanded that the testing of coronavirus be made free for all States. Besides, they asked for good quality PPE and their greater availability.

Concern was raised over doctors and nurses falling ill while treating the coronavirus patients and the number of hospitals being sealed. The participating leaders, who also included BJP’s NDA allies, sought greater protection of health workers. The issue of tracing contact trail of Tabligh-e-Jamaat across the States also cropped up during the conference.

Leaders broached the issue of upcoming crop season including that of wheat and mustard and understood to have demanded a package worth one per cent of the GDP.

The Prime Minister said States, district administration and ‘experts’ have suggested extension of lockdown to contain its community spread, sources said.

Top Government officials detailed steps by the Centre to meet the emerging challenges, including status of distribution of benefits under Prime Minister’s ‘Garib Kalyan Yojna’.

Those participated in the meet included Ghulam Nabi Azad, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, and Nationalist Congress Party head Sharad Pawar. Besides others who participated were Ram Gopal Yadav (SP), Satish Chandra Mishra ( BSP), TR Balu (DMK), Rajiv Ranjan and RCP Singh (JDU), Chirag Paswan (RLSP), Sukhbir Badal (SAD), Sudip Bandyopadhyay (TMC) and Sanjay Raut (Shiv Sena).

Sources said, these leaders were briefed by secretaries of various Ministries --- health, home and rural development --- on the actions taken by the Government to tackle COVID-19 and mitigate the hardships arising out of the lockdown.

The meet comes amidst indications that the Central Government may extend the lockdown across the country beyond April 14 after several States have favoured the extension to contain the fast-spreading virus, as the positive cases in the country show no signs of any let-up with several States including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh developing more ‘hotspots’ .

Modi interacted with the parties whose strength of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha adds up to five that led to protest from smaller parties like AIMIM who could not participate in the conference.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm--opp-concur-on-more-lockdown-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/pm--opp-concur-on-more-lockdown.html
199,09-4-20,"Delhi seals 20 hotspots, UP 102 completely","Taking a cue from of the much-talked about Bhilwara model, the Delhi Government and the Uttar Pradesh Government on Wednesday decided to completely seal Covid-19 hotspots in their respective States.

The decision will mean suspension of all activities, including movement of people, “nobody will be allowed to enter or exit from these areas”.

The Delhi Government has sealed 20 Covid-19 hotspots in the national Capital to combat the spread of the novel virus, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced on Wednesday after attending a meeting called by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. “Nobody will be allowed to enter or exit from these areas. While the administration will ensure door-to-door delivery of essential items,” he said.

The UP Government said all the 102 designated “hotspots” in 15 districts where numbers of COVID-19 cases are high will be sealed till April 15.

People came out on the streets when reports started circulating in some news channels that the whole of 15 districts in UP would be sealed. Fearing that the shops will be closed, people swamped the grocery shops and vegetable markets across the State throwing the caution of social distancing to the wind. In many places police had to use force and asked people to go back.

They even forcibly closed the shops.

UP Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said here on Wednesday that the hotspots of the districts which have reported six or more novel corona positive cases would be sealed and no one including mediapersons would be allowed there. “All banks and other establishments would be closed and residents of the locality will be provided foodgrains, milk and vegetables at their door steps,” Awasthi said.

Awasthi clarified that the districts will not be sealed. It is only the hotspot areas - where number of corona positive cases is high - would be sealed. The said lockdown in other parts of cities will remain enforced as usual.

There are 102 hotspots in Uttar Pradesh. The highest hotspot areas are in Agra where 22 localities would be sealed followed by 13 in Ghaziabad, 12 each Gautam Buddha Nagar and Lucknow, 10 in Kanpur, four in Varanasi, three in Shamli, 7 in Meerut, 3 each in Bulandshahr, Basti and Ferozabad, four each in Saharanpur and Maharajganj and one each in Sitapur and Bareilly.

The Director General of Police RC Awasthi said that curfew-like situation will prevail in these hotspot localities and no one will be allowed to come out of the house. “This is done to ensure that no infected person should infect others,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-seals-20-hotspots--up-102-completely-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/delhi-seals-20-hotspots--up-102-completely.html
200,09-4-20,"Now, wearing face mask compulsory at all public places","The national Capital Delhi on Wednesday joined several States and cities, including Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Nagaland, Maharashtra, Jammu & Kashmir and Chandigarh, in making wearing of face masks mandatory for venturing out of home for any reason during lockdown.

Declaring that wearing masks while going out has been made compulsory in the national Capital, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that people found without the mask will be persecuted.

“Wearing of facial masks can reduce the spread of coronavirus substantially. Therefore, it has been decided that facial masks will be compulsory for anyone stepping out of their house. Cloth mask shall be eligible too,” Kejriwal said on Twitter.

The Uttar Pradesh Government also made it mandatory for people in the State to wear masks to check the spread of coronavirus. “Wearing of masks has been made compulsory in the State. There can be legal action for not wearing masks,” Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Avnish Awasthi said.

During the day, the Maharashtra Government also initiated similar measure, making it mandatory for people to wear face masks in public places, streets, hospitals, offices, markets and while travelling in vehicles. Maharashtra has so far reported 1,135 cases.

Nagaland was the first State that has made use of masks and hand sanitisers compulsory in the State. The Centre has also issued an advisory asking people to wear “homemade face covers” particularly when they step out of their houses.

According to an order issued by the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi, “All persons will be moving for whatsoever purpose and under whatever reason in a public place, like street, hospital, office, markets must be wearing 3-ply mask or cloth mask.”

“These masks may be standard masks available with the chemist or even homemade washable masks and can be reused after proper washing and disinfecting them. Those found violating the rule will punished under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” the order said. The development came shortly after Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday urged people to use masks.

Chandigarh has also made compulsory for people to wear masks in public places from Wednesday. Adviser to Chandigarh administrator VP Singh Badnore, Manoj Parida said that they have made it mandatory for people in Chandigarh to wear masks or cloth on their face from Wednesday.

Odisha was the first State which made it mandatory for people to cover their mouth and nose with any available form of mask when they come out of home for any purpose from April 9.

In its advisory on the use of homemade protective cover for face and mouth’ , the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said the use of such masks will help in protecting the community at large and that certain countries have claimed benefits of homemade face masks for the general public.

The office of Principal Scienti?c Adviser (PSA) to the Modi Government has also issued an advisory, for wearing of mask for people living in densely populated areas across India. The Ministry of Consumer Affairs has already declared that masks will be treated as essential commodities till 30 June to check hoarding and black-marketing. The prices of surgical masks (3 ply) and non-woven masks also were capped at Rs 10 and Rs 8 respectively.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/now--wearing-face-mask-compulsory-at-all-public-places-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/now--wearing-face-mask-compulsory-at-all-public-places.html
201,09-4-20,"All Covid-19 tests free, even at pvt labs/hospitals: SC","The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed that Covid-19 tests in approved Government labs or private laboratories should be conducted free of cost and the Centre should immediately issue directions in this regard.

The SC said the private hospitals, including laboratories, have an important role to play in containing the scale of the pandemic by extending philanthropic services in the hour of national crisis.

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Ravindra Bhat, which heard the matter via video conferencing, said tests relating to Covid-19 must be carried out in NABL accredited Labs or any agencies approved by WHO or ICMR.

“We, thus, issue following interim directions to the respondents: (i)The tests relating to Covid-19 whether in approved Government Laboratories or approved private Laboratories shall be free of cost. The respondents (Centre and other authorities) shall issue necessary direction in this regard immediately. (ii) Tests relating to Covid-19 must be carried out in NABL accredited Labs or any agencies approved by WHO or ICMR,” the bench said.

“We find prima facie substance in the submission of petitioner that at this time of national calamity permitting private labs to charge Rs 4,500 for screening and confirmation test of COVID-19 may not be within means of a large part of population of this country and no person be deprived to undergo the COVID-19 test due to non-payment of capped amount of Rs 4,500,” the bench said in its order.

The top court issued directions on a PIL filed by advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi seeking a direction to the Centre and authorities to provide free of cost testing facility for COVID-19 to all citizens in the country.

It noted the Centre’s submission that government laboratories are conducting the COVID-19 tests free of cost.

The top court said that the private hospitals including laboratories have an important role to play in containing the scale of pandemic by extending philanthropic services in the hour of national crisis.

“We thus are satisfied that the petitioner has made out a case for issuing a direction to the respondents to issue necessary direction to accredited private Labs to conduct free of cost COVID-19 test,” the bench said.

It said that tests relating to COVID-19 must be carried out in National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) accredited Labs or any agencies approved by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

The bench, which issued notice to the Centre and sought its response in two weeks, clarified that the question as to whether the private laboratories carrying free of cost COVID-19 tests are entitled for any reimbursement of expenses incurred shall be considered later on.

It noted that the PIL also challenges the advisory dated March 17, issued by Indian Council of Medical Research Department of Health Research, by which it fixed Rs 4,500 for screening and confirming COVID-19.

The bench said the petitioner also prays that a direction be issued that all the tests relating to COVID-19 must be carried out under NABL accredited Labs or any agencies approved by WHO or ICMR.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/all-covid-19-tests-free--even-at-pvt-labs-hospitals--sc-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/all-covid-19-tests-free--even-at-pvt-labs-hospitals--sc.html
202,09-4-20,Fugitive Tablighi chief Saad traced at Zakir Nagar,"The hunt for Maulana Saad, the chief of Nizamuddin Markaz of Tablighi Jamaat, ended on Tuesday after police through electronic and technical surveillance traced him in a religious place at Delhi’s Zakir Nagar.

Highly placed sources said legal action will be initiated against the Maulana if he fails to appear in front of the Investigating Officer (IO) within the given period.

Meanwhile, his lawyer Tauseef Khan on Wednesday said Saad is currently under self quarantine and will join investigation once the period of 14 days gets over.

Saad has been in the eye of storm after more than 1,400 people who had attended gathering during March 3 to 22 at Nizamuddin Markaz were tested coronavirus positive. At least 9,000 people had participated in the religious congregation in Nizamuddin. Later, many of the attendees travelled to various parts of the country.

Earlier, the Delhi Police had booked Saad, along with five others, for violating the lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and putting the lives of thousands at risk. He reportedly went missing since March 31.

The Crime Branch had also served two notices to Saad under Section 91 of Criminal Code of Procedure (CrPC). In the notices, the police have asked him to provide some documents. The second notice was issued after the reply given by Saad against the first notice was found to be unsatisfactory.

The Tablighi Jamaat cleric through his lawyers said because of the lockdown he cannot access the documents that the police are demanding him to submit.

He claimed that he is self-quarantined and therefore cannot join the police for investigation. The Delhi Police evoked Section 91 of CrPC and asked the cleric to furnish certain documents and electronic devices in his possession.

According to the FIR, the Delhi Police contacted the authorities of Markaz on March 21 and reminded them of the Government order that prohibited any political or religious gathering of more than 50 people. However, no one paid any heed to the police’s direction.

Moreover, an audio recording purportedly of Saad was found in circulation on WhatsApp on March 21, in which he was heard asking his followers to defy the lockdown and social distancing and to attend the religious gathering of the Markaz.

On March 24, the Government ordered 21-day nationwide lockdown and restricted any social, political or religious gathering. The same day a meeting was held at Hazarat Nizamuddin police station between SHO and officer bearers of Markaz.

The meeting was attended by Saad, Mohammad Ashraf, Mohammad Salman, Yunus, Mursaleen Saifi, Jishan and Mufti Shehzad and they were informed about lockdown orders.

It was found that despite repeated efforts, they did not inform the Health Department or any other Government agency about the huge gathering inside the Markaz and deliberately disobeyed Government orders.

The sub-divisional magistrate of Defence Colony inspected the premises several times and found that around 1,300 people, including foreign nationals, were residing there without maintaining social distance.

It was also found that there were no arrangements of hand sanitizers and face masks at the premises.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/fugitive-tablighi-chief-saad-traced-at-zakir-nagar.html
203,09-4-20,"Testing doubled, so did cases in 5 days","India’s coronavirus deaths and new cases more than doubled in the past five days on Wednesday as the country reported increase in tests from around 60,000 as of April 2 to around 1,15,000 tests conducted till April 7, indicating strong link between the extent of testing and identification of positive cases.

According to Ministry of Health data, 9 pm on Wednesday, the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in India stood at 5,349, including 149 deaths. On April 4, the active cases of people suffering from coronavirus disease was 2,600 and 56 deaths.

This is significant because the Government has repeatedly claimed that the cases had spiked due to detection of huge numbers of infections among delegates of religious congregation in Nizamuddin in Delhi.

According to figures collected from States till 9 pm, on Wednesday, the financial capital of the country, Maharashtra, alone accounts for 72 deaths followed by Madhya Pradesh (21), Gujarat (16), and Telangana (11).

At least 773 new infections and 32 deaths due to COVID-19 were reported in 24 hours. Till date total 402 people have been discharged, said Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary in the Union Health Ministry at a Press briefing here.

To add to the agony of the health authorities, in not all cases the virus show its symptoms immediately infecting a person.

Agarwal said asymptomatic people as carriers of infection is one of the biggest challenges to contain the spread of coronavirus.

An asymptomatic person does not show symptoms, but can still pass the virus to others. “We are actually dealing with a very huge challenge along with the rest of the world. In this particular infectious disease, not only people who are symptomatic, but even asymptomatic persons as a carrier may pass on the infection”, he said.

States that have the most coronavirus cases are Maharashtra (1,135), Tamil Nadu (738), Delhi (576), Telangana (453), Rajasthan (363) and Kerala (336). The first three States account for 43 per cent of the total cases in the country while the geographical spread of coronavirus outbreak in India has now extended to 30 States and Union Territories with Tripura being the latest to report Covid-19 cases.

With cases on increase, the testing across the country has nearly doubled in the last couple of days.

This suggests that as other States ramp up testing, more cases could get reported from those States as well.

Around 121,271 cases have been tested so far and 13,345 tests are done in a day through 139 labs under ICMR and 65 private laboratories, said a senior scientist from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

And with the Supreme Court on Wednesday directing the States to ensure that tests are conducted free of costs even in the private labs - payments issue to be sorted out later - more cases are likely to be reported in the coming days.

Experts said the number may cross 10,000-mark in the next week. This is likely to overwhelm the existing health resources which are already overburdened. The Government has come out with a three-tier category of hospitals for patients with diverse levels of infection.

These are early days yet and the State-wise distribution could change rapidly in the coming days. Across the country, there seems to be a strong link between the extent of testing done by States and the number of cases that have been identified.

Agarwal said in the backdrop of the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country, the response and preparedness of the Government is intensifying.

Agarwal said to break the chain of transmission, action plans have been made for each district in the country as he cited door-to-door surveys conducted in Pune to identify people having symptoms and people with hypertension and diabetes were also included in the survey.

Several districts have taken measures which have emerged as best practices. For instance, he said, Pune district sealed the central region of Pune and Kondhwa area effectively and carried out door-to-door survey of homes located across 35 square kilometer area. The team is also checking persons with co-morbidity like diabetes and hypertension apart from travel history and contact tracing.

Similarly, Pathanamthitta district ensured surveillance, gathering travel history, contact tracing, ensuring quarantine facilities and providing essential & psychological support.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/testing-doubled--so-did-cases-in-5-days-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/testing-doubled--so-did-cases-in-5-days.html

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro said, “Just as Lord Hanuman brought the holy medicine from the Himalayas to save the life of Lord Rama’s brother Lakshmana, and Jesus healed those who were sick and restored the sight to Bartimeu, India and Brazil will overcome this global crisis by joining forces and sharing blessings for the sake of all peoples.”

The Brazilian President was the chief guest at this year’s Republic Day. Brazil is s one of the 30 countries which has asked India to do away with the ban.

The Prime Minister assured all possible support to the Brazilian President and agreed that officials from both the countries would remain in regular touch with respect to the COVID-19 situation and its emerging challenges. Brazil has over 14,000 cases and 127 deaths so far.

The two leaders had spoken to each other on the telephone on last Saturday and discussed the situation across the world in the wake of the COVID-19. “Had a productive telephone conversation with President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro about how India and Brazil can join forces against the #COVID19 pandemic,” Modi had tweeted.

US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and called him “great” and “really good” for supplying the drug a day after warning “retaliation” if India did not export it.

The US President for the past few days is claiming that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine will be the “game changer” in fighting the pandemic which is now raging through that country claiming more than 13,000 lives.

Thanking Modi for making available the drug, Trump said on Wednesday the first shipment of a total of 29 million doses of the drug was on its way from three factories in Gujarat to the United States, reports news agency PTI.

209,09-4-20,Pak aiming to score narrow political goals by seeking COVID-19 initiatives under SAARC: Sources,"Pakistan is aiming to score narrow political goals by attempting to bring India's initiatives to collectively fight the coronavirus pandemic in the SAARC region under the formal umbrella of the grouping, government sources said on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Pakistan boycotted a video conference of trade officials of the SAARC countries to discuss ways to minimise the economic cost of the pandemic.

Islamabad said such initiatives could only be effective if spearheaded by the group's secretariat instead of India.

In such a scenario, the sources said, Pakistan will get a free hand to block India's initiatives and proposals by using the SAARC charter of provisions and rules of procedure.

""It is an attempt to score narrow political goals while people of the region are facing the coronavirus crisis,"" said a source on Thursday.

The trade officials of the SAARC countries on Wednesday broadly agreed to identify new ways to ""sustain and expand"" the intra-regional trade to offset the huge economic cost of the coronavirus pandemic.

The officials also deliberated on creating a larger framework of trade facilitation and highlighted the need to enhance the quantum of intra-SAARC trade as the pandemic is likely to have a considerable impact on the region.

The deliberations took place as a follow up to an India-initiated video conference of SAARC leaders on March 15. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested in the conference that the member nations of the bloc should come together to jointly fight the pandemic.

The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is a regional grouping comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

All the SAARC member nations are reeling under adverse social and economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

212,09-4-20,"Trump thanks India on HCQ decision, says will not be forgotten","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday thanked India for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to allow the export of malaria drug Hydroxychloroquine to the United States.

Extraordinary times require even closer cooperation between friends. Thank you India and the Indian people for the decision on HCQ. Will not be forgotten! Trump said in a tweet, a day after India lifted the hold on export of the drug to the US.

Thank you Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) for your strong leadership in helping not just India, but humanity, in this fight! he said.

President Trump has been pushing for the use of Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. United States has emerged as a hotspot of coronavirus.

The dreaded disease has inflicted more than four lakh Americans, claiming lives of over 14,000 of them till Wednesday.

Hydroxychloroquine has been identified by the US Food and Drug Administration as a possible line of treatment for the COVID-19 and it is being tested on more than 1,500 coronavirus patients in New York.

Anticipating that it will work, given initial positive results, Trump has bought more than 29 million doses of Hydroxychloroquine for potential treatment of the COVID-19 patients.

President Trump and Prime Minister Modi spoke over the phone last week. During the call, Trump had requested Modi to lift the hold on the American order of Hydroxychloroquine, of which India is the major producer.

""I bought millions of doses (of Hydroxychloroquine). More than 29 million. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi, a lot of it (Hydroxychloroquine) comes out of India. I asked him if he would release it? He was Great. He was really good,"" Trump told Sean Hannity of the Fox News on Monday night.

""You know they put a stop because they wanted it for India, Trump said, responding to a question on the usage of Hydroxychloroquine. India allowed on Tuesday the export of Hydroxychloroquine to the US, which has emerged as the global hotspot of COVID-19.

During the interview, Trump described Hydroxychloroquine as a powerful malaria drug, saying the drug is being tested on hundreds of coronavirus patients in New York.

But there are a lot of good things coming from that, he said.

Lot of people are looking at it and saying, you know I don't hear bad stories, I hear good stories. And I don't hear anything where it is causing death, said the US President.

Hydroxychloroquine, an old and inexpensive drug used to treat malaria, is seen as a viable therapeutic solution by President Trump to coronavirus.

Last week Trump had said he sought help from Prime Minister Modi to allow the sale of Hydroxychloroquine tablets ordered by the US to treat the growing number of coronavirus patients in his country, hours after India banned the export of the anti-malarial drug.

India has received similar requests from several other countries including its immediate neighbours Sri Lanka and Nepal. India has said that it is reviewing its export ban order. Notably, India's decision to ban the exports of Hydroxychloroquine is driven by its desire to take stock of the domestic requirements and ensure that the country has enough of the drug.

""I would be surprised if he would, you know, because India does very well with the United States,"" Trump told reporters during a press briefing at the White House on Monday.

Trump and Modi enjoy a personal friendship as reflected in the president joining the prime minister at the ""Howdy, Modi!"" event in Houston last September. This February, Trump made a rare India-specific solo trip to Ahmedabad and New Delhi.

India on Monday agreed to lift the ban on export of Hydroxychloroquine to the US. Three Gujarat-based companies would export these tablets to the US, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said on Tuesday.

India produces 70 per cent of the world's supply of Hydroxychloroquine, according to Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) secretary-general Sudarshan Jain.

The country has a production capacity of 40 tonnes of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) every month, implying 20 crore tablets of 200 mg each. And since the drug is also used to auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, manufacturers have good production capacities that can also be ramped up.

""He's stable, improving, sat up and engaged with medical staff. I've known the Prime Minister for a long time and I wish him well in this difficult time and I think things are getting better for him,"" added UK Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden on Thursday morning.

UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for the UK prime minister while he continues treatment for Covid-19, will chair a virtual Cobra emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss a review of the UK's coronavirus lockdown to consider whether the strict social distancing measures should be extended beyond the 21-day period initially announced by Johnson on March 23. The measures are set to end next Monday but indications are that they would have to be extended.

Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething who will take part in the Cobra meeting said there was ""virtually zero prospect"" of government experts advising that it was safe to lift the lockdown, adding the measures would continue for ""a number of weeks"".

""I think rather than speculate about the future, I think we should focus very seriously on the here and now and the present,"" said Rishi Sunak, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer who led the daily Downing Street briefing on Wednesday evening.

The senior Indian-origin Cabinet minister, who announced a new 750-million pound fund to support frontline charities across the UK through the pandemic, stressed the importance of the British public continuing to follow the government's stay-at-home guidance especially during what is a usual holiday travel period over a long Easter weekend.

Sunak, who is the next in line in the government's chain of command after UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, also gave his own update on the UK PM's health to confirm that he was sitting up in bed and engaging with his clinical team.

""The latest from the hospital is the prime minister remains in intensive care where his condition is improving,"" he said.

The prime minister is not only my colleague and my boss but also my friend, and my thoughts are with him and his family,"" he said, adding that the UK PM's illness is a reminder how indiscriminate this disease is .

The coronavirus death toll in the UK registered another record daily jump of 938 fatalities on Wednesday to hit 7,097. Deputy chief scientific adviser, Dame Angela McLean, said the number of new cases was not ""accelerating out of control"" in the country and warned against complacency and breaking the lockdown norms.

217,09-4-20,Spain reports slight drop in daily virus deaths,"Spanish health authorities say that reported coronavirus infections and deaths have gone down again after a two-day uptick, hopefully signaling a return to the overall slowdown in the pandemic growth under a national lockdown.

The Health Ministry said Thursday that authorities reported 5,756 new cases and 728 new deaths over the previous 24-hour period. That is compared to new 6,180 cases and 757 new deaths on Wednesday.

Overall, Spain has 152,446 infections and 15,283 fatalities since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, situating it as one of the world's hardest-hit countries along with the United States and Italy.

Over 52,000 patients have also recovered in Spain, as pressure has eased slightly on its hospitals.

Like many countries, Spain is struggling to gauge the true extent of the virus outbreak due to a lag in testing of the general population. Authorities have recognized that several thousand of elderly people have died in nursing homes without being tested. Only deaths of people who had tested positive are being included in the official statistics.

The latest figures were released as Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S nchez appeared before the national Parliament to ask for its endorsement of a second two-week extension of Spain's state of emergency that permits the lockdown against the virus.

218,09-4-20,Monkey business in deserted Ayodhya,"It is not only human but animals too are facing the brunt of lockdown as hundreds of starving macaque monkeys, who are denied food because of absence of tourists and Ram Bhakts, have started attacking residents in the temple town of Ayodhya.

The Ayodhya police are now busy listening to the woes of people as monkeys have started stealing food and mobile phones from the residential areas near the prominent temples of Ayodhya. Also, they are breaking into homes, frightening the inmates and biting them.

Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of Ayodhya Dr Anil Kumar said hospital is getting at least 40 patients of monkey attack daily. “Majority of the patients are children and women. Some of them carry scratch marks while some have bite marks as well,” he said.

Dr Kumar said in today’s world where people are scared of corona virus, a small monkey scratch is creating a scare because it is believed that human-monkey interaction is the higher risk of disease transmission between the two species.

In Ayodhya — Ram ki Nagari — monkey are revered as part of Hanuman ki sena. Pilgrims coming from different parts of the country used to feed them with bananas and other fruits. The monkeys too were used to human presence.

With Ayodhya being locked down due to coronavirus no pilgrim is allowed to enter the city and restaurants are closed too. The local residents are too not allowed to visit any temple as all of them, including the Hanumangarhi and Ram mandir — where Ram Lalla was shifted on March 25 — have been closed for public.

With no option left, the starving monkeys have started invading residential areas.

Dr Kumar said monkeys are turning violent due to lockdown as they are not getting food leading to such change in their behaviour.

There are no vehicles on the roads and therefore these monkeys are using the empty roads as their play grounds. And if any commuter passes by they attack them.

The local administration has asked the local ashrams and temples to give food to these starving monkeys but as the temples are closed the monkeys are looking for other options.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked the NGOs and the Horticulture Department to take care of stray animals, including cow, dogs and monkeys.

Meanwhile, in Sambhal, 19 monkeys have died in the past eight days in the Panwasa village because of starvation.

Officials of the Animal Husbandry and the Forest Department have sent the carcass of a dead monkey to Bareilly for a post-mortem.

Local said in the last eight days monkeys suddenly get ill and then die within 24-48 hours in Panwasa village.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/monkey-business-in-deserted-ayodhya-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/monkey-business-in-deserted-ayodhya.html

After 1999's ""Kartoos"", Bhatt gave up the responsibilities of a director. Now he is back in the director's chair for the upcoming ""Sadak 2"", and Anand, who is working with him again, couldn't be more thrilled about it.

""It's been a wonderful film to do because the last film that I did with him was 'Zakhm'. Soon he retired (as a director) and he has now come back to direct. Doing that film ('Sadak 2') with him, for me, was like a cherished moment,"" Akshay told IANS.

Asked if he noticed any changes in him as a director, Akshay said: ""Yes, he has matured a lot. He is so richly and deeply oozing with value for life. He wants to give it to a lot of people through his films and dialogues, and through the ideas that he has in his mind. 'Sadak 2' is a very different kind of a film. It's been made beautifully. You will definitely get a different kind of Bhatt sahab,"" promised the actor.

Akshay also shared some information about his role in the upcoming film, which stars Sanjay Dutt, Alia Bhatt, Pooja Bhatt and Aditya Roy Kapur.

""I am playing Sanjay Dutt's friend. I am one of those people who convinces him to live life for a reason. He listens to me. It's an important role even though it's a cameo. It's like the role I did in 'Ghulam'. It was a small role but the character lives on through the film,"" he said.

220,09-4-20,Brazilian prez thanks Modi for allowing export of raw materials to produce hydroxychloroquine,"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for facilitating the export of raw materials to Brazil for production of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, cited by many as a viable therapeutic solution to fight coronavirus infection.

In an address to the nation on Wednesday, Bolsonaro said Brazil will receive ingredients from India for the production of hydroxychloroquine on Saturday.

""We have more good news. As an outcome of my direct conversation with Prime Minister of India, we will receive, by Saturday, raw materials to continue our production of hydroxychloroquine so that we can treat patients of COVID-19 as well as of lupus, malaria, and arthritis,"" he said.

""I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the people of India for such timely help to the people of Brazil,"" the Brazilian leader said.

Parts of the transcript of his speech were made available by a diplomat from the Latin American country.

Modi and Bolsonaro had a telephonic conversation on April 4 during which the Brazilian leader requested Modi to allow export of the drug as well as raw materials for its production in Brazil.

Separately, in a letter to Modi on Tuesday, Bolsonaro mentioned that two Brazilian laboratories, EMS and Apsen, have been importing raw materials from India for several years to produce hydroxychloroquine and that Brazil's internal supply of the drug depends on its production by the two firms.

Bolsonaro requested Modi to ensure that Brazil gets the supply of the raw material ordered prior to the imposition of the ban on hydroxychloroquine.

On March 25, India banned export of hydroxychloroquine in the midst of views in some quarters that the drug could be used to fight COVID-19. India is the largest exporter of the drug. The ban was partially lifted on Tuesday.

In the letter to Modi, the Brazilian leader invoked ancient Indian epic, Ramayana, mentioning the story of how Lord Hanuman brought a holy medicine from the Himalayas to save the life of Laxmana.

Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, has recorded close to 14,000 coronavirus cases and over 660 deaths due to the infection. Globally, the virus has killed over 75,000 people and infected more than 13 lakh.

Bolsonaro said Brazil hoped that the use of hydroxychloroquine would help in the treatment of coronavirus-infected people in his country.

""Like many other countries, Brazil places hope in the use of hydroxychloroquine as an effective means to treat patients who have contracted COVID-19,"" the Brazilian leader wrote in the letter.

He also referred to the partnership between the two countries in the pharmaceutical sector, adding that leading Brazilian pharmaceutical laboratories have a ""solid and long"" partnership with Indian laboratories.

221,09-4-20,"Hydroxychloroquine use may lead to irregular heartbeats, low blood sugar: Study","The drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, being used to treat and prevent COVID-19 despite weak evidence for their effectiveness, may have adverse side effects on patients like irregular heartbeats and reduced blood glucose levels, a new study says.

The review research, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, provides an overview of potential harms associated with these drugs as well as their management based on the best available evidence.

""Physicians and patients should be aware of several rare but potentially life-threatening adverse effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine,"" said David Juurlink, Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, and a senior scientist at ICES.

According to the scientists, the potential adverse effects of these drugs include irregular heartbeats, reduced blood glucose levels, neuropsychiatric effects, such as agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and paranoia.

They said some people's bodies process chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine poorly, and a small percentage metabolise them rapidly, affecting their response to treatment.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, the scientists said, are highly toxic in overdose and can cause seizures, coma, and cardiac arrest.

The researchers added that indescriminate use of hydroxychloroquine may make it unavailable to patients with autoimmune disorders -- such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other chronic diseases -- who are mainly prescribed the drug.

According to the review, the evidence that these treatments might be beneficial in patients with COVID-19 is of poor quality, and it is possible that the drugs could worsen the disease.

""Despite optimism (in some, even enthusiasm) for the potential of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19, little consideration has been given to the possibility that the drugs might negatively influence the course of disease,"" said Juurlink.

""This is why we need a better evidence base before routinely using these drugs to treat patients with COVID-19,"" he added.

222,09-4-20,Tips on How to Make Doctors Stay Long in a Medical Facility,"It’s easy for medical professionals to switch jobs. Given the increase in demand, hospitals are running after these professionals. They can choose the best medical facility to serve. Therefore, if you’re lucky to end up with quality doctors and nurses, you have to find a way to keep them. These tips will help ensure that you can make them work with you for a long time.

Give them enough workload

Being a doctor is already stressful, considering the nature of the job. To cure patients, doctors have to study each case and make the right choice. If they have to deal with several patients at once, it might be too much for them. Under an exceptional circumstance like a pandemic, it’s understandable since all hands are on deck. However, on a regular day, you can’t overburden your doctors.

Send them to medical conferences

Your doctors are also hungry for knowledge. They need to grow and learn more. Professional development will only happen if you give them a chance to go to conferences outside the hospital. They can listen to researches and other updates in the field. It’s also an opportunity to meet with other doctors and learn from them.

Apart from medical conferences, some doctors might also want to improve through online courses. They need to know more information about recent trends and medical cases. Don’t hesitate to give them what they request. Considering that it will also benefit the medical facility in the long run, you need to be supportive.

Don’t create a toxic environment

Again, it’s already tricky for doctors to do their job. They see people dying all the time. They also have to treat cases they never dealt with in the past. Make sure that you don’t make things even worse. Try to quash the culture of gossip at work. It can’t have any place in the hospital. You also have to avoid pitting people against each other. Your doctors need to feel safe while working. Otherwise, they will find it even more difficult to do their job.

Give them the power to decide

In most medical facilities, doctors are also part of the board of directors. It means that they have a say in making decisions in various aspects. You have to listen to them since their priority is always the needs of the patients. Sometimes, you get caught up on the idea of turning the medical facility into a money-making machine. You forget that the primary goal is to serve patients and help them recover.

With these tips, you can guarantee that doctors continue working with you for a long time. If you have a hard time looking for doctors in the first place, there’s no harm in working with a physician recruiter.

223,09-4-20,"China's recent COVID-19 cases rise to 1,100 with 63 new infections","China has reported 63 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, including 61 imported ones, raising concern of a second wave of infections as the country on Wednesday lifted the 76-day lockdown of Wuhan, the origin point and epicentre for the COVID-19 pandemic, health officials said on Thursday.

The Chinese health authority said on Thursday that two deaths were also reported taking the total death toll in the country to 3,335. The overall coronavirus cases have reached 81,865 in the country.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) said on Thursday it received reports of 63 new confirmed coronavirus cases on the Chinese mainland on Wednesday, of which 61 were imported, taking the total tally to 1,104.

After nearly three months of grim battle against the coronavirus since January, China is fast returning to normalcy with factories and business humming back to activity amid concerns of a rebound due to steady rise of new infections especially coming from thousands of Chinese returning from abroad.

The 76-day lockdown of Wuhan was lifted by the authorities on Wednesday. Tens of thousands of people in Wuhan, the origin point and epicentre for the coronavirus pandemic, began travelling out of the sprawling city.

However, two new domestic cases were reported in Guangdong Province.

Also on Wednesday, 56 new asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, including 28 from abroad, were reported on the mainland taking their total to 1,104. Many of them were put under quarantine.

Asymptomatic coronavirus cases are those who test positive for the virus but do not show any symptoms and have the potential to cause sporadic clusters of infections.

As of Wednesday, the Chinese mainland had reported a total of 1,103 imported cases. Of the cases, 374 had been discharged from hospitals after recovery, and 729 were being treated with 31 in severe condition, NHC said.

It said 73 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus.

Hubei province and its capital Wuhan from where the virus was first surfaced in December last year, reported two new deaths on Wednesday with no cases.

Wednesday was also a landmark day for Wuhan as ten of thousands of people of the 11 million city travelled by road, air and trains for the first time after Jan 23 lockdown as the government has lifted all cubs.

By Wednesday, 960 confirmed cases including four deaths had been reported in Hong Kong, 45 confirmed cases in the Macao and 379 in Taiwan including five deaths, state run Xinhua news agency reported.

The virus, which first broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, has since spread around the world infecting more than 1.4 million people, killing more than 82,000.

224,09-4-20,WHO urges virus unity after Trump attack,"World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday urged leaders to stop politicising the coronavirus pandemic following stinging criticism of the WHO from US President Donald Trump.

The WHO director-general urged the US and China to join forces in fighting the disease rather than indulging in a blame game.

Tedros hit back after Trump took aim at the UN health body, accusing it of taking US money but favouring China, where the outbreak emerged in December.

""The WHO really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look,"" Trump said on Twitter.

""Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?"" Tedros issued a stern defence of the WHO's handling of the pandemic, which has killed more than 80,000 people, while more than 1.4 million people have tested positive.

""The United States and China should come together and fight this dangerous enemy,"" Tedros told a virtual press briefing in Geneva.

""The focus of all political parties should be to save their people. Please don't politicise this virus.

""If you want to have many more body bags -- then you do it. If you don't want many more body bags, then you refrain from politicising it.

""Quarantine, politicising COVID... we shouldn't waste time pointing fingers,"" he said, adding: ""It's like playing with fire.""

""We will have many body bags in front of us if we don't behave. When there are cracks at national level and global level, that's when the virus succeeds. For God's sake, we have lost more than 60,000 citizens of the world. What are we doing? Is this not enough?""

Despite Trump's tweet, Tedros also said that he expected US funding for the WHO to continue.

He thanked Washington for its ""generous support"" thus far, adding that the ""US will continue to contribute its share"".

Tedros said there would be worse to come from COVID-19 if countries did not unite to stand up to its spread.

""Let's fight like hell to suppress and control this virus. It's dangerous,"" he said.

""Otherwise, with the way we are doing now, I think we will regret it.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/who-urges-virus-unity-after-trump-attack-2020-04-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/who-urges-virus-unity-after-trump-attack.html

226,09-4-20,"WHO chief 'politicising' COVID-19 pandemic, siding with China: Trump","US President Donald Trump has fired a fresh salvo at the World Health Organization, accusing its chief of siding with China and ""politicising"" the coronavirus pandemic while repeating his threat to freeze the UN agency's funding.

Trump's allegation comes a day after the US President threatened to put a ""very powerful"" hold on US' funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) and criticised it for having ""missed the call"" in its response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Trump slammed the Geneva-based global health agency for its early guidance aimed at countering the international spread of the coronavirus

The president's fresh allegation comes after WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned against politicisation of COVID-19 and said that such a move will only result in ""many more body bags"".

""If you want to be exploited and if you want to have many more body bags, then you [politicize the virus]. If you don't want many more body bags, then you refrain from politicizing it,"" Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday.

Hours later at the White House conference, Trump agreed that the COVID-19 should not be politicised, but alleged that the WHO chief was doing exactly that and was siding with China.

""When he (Ghebreyesus) says politicizing, he's politicizing. That shouldn't be. We spend USD 450 million last year, hundreds of millions in previous years. And they got to do better than that. They got to do better. When you talk about politics, I can't believe he's talking about politics look at the relationship they have to China,"" Trump said in response to a question.

""China spends USD 42 million. We spend USD 450 million and everything seems to be China's way. That's not right. It's not fair to us. And honestly, it's not fair to the world,"" he said.

The United States is reevaluating its funding with respect to the WHO, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at the White House.

""This is very consistent with what President Trump said since the beginning of his campaign. Organizations have to work,"" he added.

""They have to deliver the outcomes for which they were intended and we need to make sure that only the WHO but every international organization that we take taxpayer money and give it to them for the benefit of America we need to make sure it is delivering on this taxpayer dollars. The WHO is no different in that respect,"" the top American diplomat said.

Trump asserted that the WHO had to get its priority right.

""I think they have to get their priorities right and their priorities are that everybody has to be treated properly, every country. And it doesn't seem that way, he said.

""It doesn't seem that way so we are going to do study investigation and we are going to make a determination as to what we are doing. In the meantime, we are holding back, we are going very unfair to the United States USD 452 million compared to USD 42 million that is to the World Health Organization. That is not good, that is not good, not fair,"" he said.

""Not fair at all and other countries as you know also gave very substantially less than the United States and the world WHO got it wrong. I mean they got it very wrong, in many ways they were wrong. They also minimised the threat very strongly and not good,"" Trump said.

In a statement, Senator Patrick Leahy said the WHO needed reform, just as it needs the strong support of the United States and other countries in order to do its job.

""But such complaints also apply to President Trump, who ignored numerous warnings, downplayed the threat, discounted medical science and squandered valuable time that could have saved countless lives,"" the Democratic Senator said.

""He continues to shamelessly and relentlessly try to shift responsibility for his disastrous response to the coronavirus to anyone and everyone except himself. It's the American people who desperately need new leadership,"" Leahy said.

Senator Ted Cruz, in an interview to Houston's Michael Berry Show, alleged that if China behaved like a responsible government, this crisis could have been averted.

It could have potentially been contained to the region where the outbreak occurred, but for months, they denied it, they suppressed it, he said.

""The World Health Organization acted as puppet and a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist government, insisting the coronavirus had no risk of a human to human transmission... the World Health Organization was helping China spread that propaganda. Many of the deaths we have seen worldwide are a direct consequence of the Chinese coverup,"" Cruz said. PTI LKJ

The track, penned by Prasoon Joshi and sung by Mohit Chauhan, had featured in Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's 2009 feature ""Delhi 6"", starring Abhishek Bachchan and Sonam Kapoor.

On Wednesday, Bhushan Kumar's T-series launched the remixed version of the song from composer Tanishq Bagchi and singers Tulsi Kumar and Sachet Tandon. The track's music video features Sidharth Malhotra and Tara Sutaria.

Rahman posted a brief statement on Twitter, saying he never took ""short cuts"" in his career and urged other musicians to do the same.

""No short cuts, properly commissioned, sleepless nights, writes and re-writes. Over 200 musicians, 365 days of creative brainstorming with the aim to produce music that can last generations.

Though Kapoor and Chauhan are yet to break silence on the recreated song, the actor and the singer shared Rahman's tweet on their respective Twitter handles.

The team of the original also found support from filmmaker Hansal Mehta who termed the remixed version of ""Masakali"" as ""awful and ear shattering"".

""Yes. I am reacting to the awful, ear shattering #Masakali version. But check its YouTube views in 48 hrs. Then see how DJs blast it at events. And how people groove to the godawful version. S**t sells. While we cringe, somebody is laughing his way to the bank,"" Mehta wrote in twitter.

T-Series and Bagchi are yet to respond to the controversy.

This is not the first time that Rahman's songs have been recreated. Earlier this year, Varun Dhawan-starrer ""Street Dancer 3D"" had featured a remixed version of Rahman's cult classic track ""Muqabla"".

233,09-4-20,Karnataka favours lockdown for 2 more weeks: CM,"The Karnataka Cabinet is in favour of extending the 21-day nationwide lockdown by two weeks to fight the coronavirus scare, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said on Thursday.

""All the ministers are in favour of continuing the lockdown for two more weeks to contain Covid-19 spread in the state, which has recorded 191 positive cases and 6 deaths till date,"" Yediyurappa told reporters after an emergent Cabinet meeting here.

Though a panel of eminent doctors on Wednesday recommended continuing the lockdown -- set to end on April 14 -- till April 30 only in hotspots like Bengaluru and Mysuru, the Cabinet did not want to take any chance by lifting the lockdown in districts not affected by the virus.

""The lockdown should continue for two more weeks to ensure that the number of coronavirus cases do not spike as was the case in some states and to prevent community spread,"" said Yediyurappa.

The panel, headed by eminent doctor Devi Shetty, and C.N. Manjunath, Nagaraj, Ravi and Sudarshan as members, was set up by the state in March to assess the pandemic and advise measures to contain its fallout across the southern state.

""The lockdown should not be lifted in the hotspots or relaxed in the districts with less or zero cases so as to contain the virus and control the situation, especially physical distancing,"" asserted the Chief Minister.

Of the 30 districts in Karnataka, 18 districts have reported corona cases, including two hotspots.

""A final decision on the lockdown will be taken on Sunday or Monday after our videoconference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday and as per his advice for the welfare of all,"" added Yediyurappa.

Modi had advised the states to suggest if the nationwide lockdown should be extended beyond April 14 or eased with curbs in areas that were free from the infection so far.

Though the 21-day lockdown was clamped on March 24 midnight across the country, nine districts of Karnataka have been under shutdown since March 14 on the panel's advice to contain the virus fallout.

In a related development, the Cabinet decided to deduct 30 per cent from salaries and allowances of all legislators, amounting to Rs 15.3 crore, for fiscal 2020-21 through an ordinance, as the Assembly is not in session.

The two sides also shared their respective domestic response strategies to deal with the pandemic which has claimed lives of over 88,000 people and infected around 15 lakh in close to 190 countries.

Russia has reported over 10,000 cases of the infection and 76 deaths while the number positive cases of the virus in India is over 5,730 with 166 deaths.

Morgulov thanked Shringla for facilitating the evacuation of Russia nationals stranded in India.

Shringla is understood to have enquired about well-being of around 15,000 Indian students studying in Russia.

""The two sides exchanged notes on the evolving situation relating to spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the respective national efforts by both the countries to combat and contain it,"" said a source.

It is not clear whether Russia is among growing number of countries seeking supply of hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus infected people.

India is supplying hydroxychloroquine to the US and several other countries hit hard by the pandemic. The drug has been cited by many as a viable therapeutic solution to fight coronavirus infection.

243,09-4-20,COVID-19: IMF anticipates sharply negative economic growth fallout since the Great Depression,"The year 2020 could see the worst global economic fallout since the Great Depression in the 1930s with over 170 countries likely to experience negative per capita income growth due to the raging coronavirus pandemic, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday.

Georgieva made the remarks during her address on “Confronting the Crisis: Priorities for the Global Economy” here ahead of next week's annual Spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.

""Today, the world is confronted with a crisis like no other. COVID-19 has disrupted our social and economic order at lightning speed and on a scale that we have not seen in living memory,"" she said.

The virus is causing a tragic loss of life, and the lockdown needed to fight it has affected billions of people. What was normal just a few weeks ago — going to school, going to work, being with family and friends — is now a huge risk, she said.

Observing that the world is faced with extraordinary uncertainty about the depth and duration of this crisis, she said that it is already clear, however, that global growth will turn sharply negative in 2020.

“In fact, we anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,” Georgieva said.

“Just three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020. Today, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year,” she said.

The Great Depression was the worst worldwide economic downturn that lasted for 10 years from 1929, beginning in the US when the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street crashed and wiped out millions of investors.

The IMF chief said that given the necessary containment measures to slow the spread of the virus, the world economy is taking a substantial hit.

This is especially true for retail, hospitality, transport, and tourism. In most countries, the majority of workers are either self-employed or employed by small and medium-sized enterprises. These businesses and workers are especially exposed, she added.

Of the view that emerging markets and low-income nations— across Africa, Latin America, and much of Asia— are at high risk, Georgieva said with weaker health systems to begin with, many face the dreadful challenge of fighting the virus in densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums, where social distancing is hardly an option.

With fewer resources to begin with, they are dangerously exposed to the ongoing demand and supply shocks, drastic tightening in financial conditions, and some may face an unsustainable debt burden, she said.

“In the last two months, portfolio outflows from emerging markets were about USD 100 billion, more than three times larger than for the same period of the global financial crisis.

Commodity exporters are taking a double blow from the collapse in commodity prices and remittances, the lifeblood of so many poor people, are expected to dwindle,” she said.

The IMF, she said, estimates the gross external financing needs for emerging markets and developing countries to be in the trillions of dollars, and they can cover only a portion of that on their own, leaving residual gaps in the hundreds of billions of dollars. They urgently need help, she said.

However, encouraging news is that all governments have sprung into action and, indeed, there has been significant coordination.

Countries around the world have taken fiscal actions amounting to about USD 8 trillion. In addition, there have been massive monetary measures from the G20 and others, she said.

As such, Georgieva said that there is need to continue with essential containment measures and support for health systems, shield affected people and firms with large, timely, targeted fiscal and financial sector measures, and reduce stress to the financial system and avoid contagion.

“Even as we move through this containment phase, we must plan for recovery,” she added.

244,09-4-20,Do we need new ventilator protocol to treat COVID-19 in India?,"With the coronavirus pandemic striking hard and spreading rapidly in India, a big question arises whether we need a new COVID-19 ventilator protocol to treat infected patients in the country?



According to Manoj Goel, Director, Pulmonology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute in New Delhi, the principle of ventilation in corona patients follows the same protocol as in any other case of serious pneumonia due to any other cause.



""However, the handling of the ventilator, the process of putting them on a ventilator and care of the patient on ventilator required extra measure which includes using various protective measures of preventing infection from the patient to the surrounding atmosphere which can lead to infection through the air to others,"" Goel told IANS.



The other point is that these patients generally require more prolonged and high levels of ventilator support as compared to other patients, the doctor said.



""Many times they are ventilated in a prone position which means patients are made to lie on their tummy rather than the back. It is more difficult to remove them from the ventilator which means the weaning from ventilators is also more prolonged, difficult and associated with higher chances of failure,"" he added.



Satyanarayana Mysore, HOD, Interventional Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine, Manipal Hospitals in Bengaluru, told IANS: ""The original patients profile from Wuhan showed lung predominant involvement. This was presented in the form of pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), interstitial fibrosis etc.



""In this condition, the virus or our defence mechanism of the body will overwhelm and the air sacs will get flooded. This is when a mechanical ventilator will be of help,"" he said.



If patients present with ARDS, they will be put on mechanical ventilation, sedation, and supportive measures. They will be on what we call as ARDSNET protocol. In summary, ventilatory management will not change.



""As far as hypoxia that is not due to ARDS, a different strategy of high flow humidified oxygen, blood transfusion, chelation may need to be considered,"" the doctor said, adding that the Indian experience in COVID-19 is fortunately mild to moderate disease and quite less percentage of the patient thus far needed ventilation.



According to Dr Rajan Sharma, President of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), due to the spread of COVID 19, there is an unprecedented demand for provision of mechanical ventilators.



""Mechanical ventilators have been in demand and shall be made use judiciously during such emergency situations. While our experience on COVID 19 is too initial, from the current protocol, there is a need to shift from hyperventilation and extensive ventilation and stress is on providing adequate oxygen,"" Sharma said.



Savitha Kuttan, CEO of Omnicuris, an online medical education platform, said that according to government data, India is critically short on ICU beds and ventilators, which is worrying because the five per cent of COVID-19 patients require an ICU admission.



""We need to decide in what manner will scarce medical resources be distributed if the cases go up and our healthcare infrastructure is overrun. The chapter on triage under the National Disaster Management Act of 2005 states that the sickest will be tended to first,"" Kuttan said.



""If the crisis deepens and hospitals are left to decide, it will be solely at their discretion, and the general public will have no means to understand the basis of the decisions,"" she noted.



Meanwhile, the total tally of COVID-19 cases in India reached up to 5,734 on Thursday. Of these, 5,095 are active cases, 166 are dead, one has migrated, while 472 people have been discharged after recovery.
