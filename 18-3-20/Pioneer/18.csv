4,18-3-20,Women are the backbone of ecotourism projects,"She is witty, vivacious and endowed with a winsome personality. Anshu Pragyan Das, a forest officer, has experienced working in Tiger Reserves of Odisha like Similipal and Satkosia for a considerable period of time with valuable contributions towards protection of landscape and livelihood of forest-dependent communities. Having completed 13 years of her service, her main thrust has been wildlife conservation and ecotourism. She has worked all along in tandem with environmentalist, carefully nourishing, nurturing, preserving and protecting her motto to promote ecotourism. Engrossed in interaction with biopic components, she focuses on socially-responsible travelling by ‘leap homes and the gentle brawns’ while working for the economic amelioration and empowerment of the communities concerned. She is the woman behind the successful ecotourism project, Satkosia Sands at Badmul in Satkosia Tiger Reserve. The project, first of its kind in the State, earned revenue of Rs 1 crore last year; and this year also providing employment in many riverine villages of the Satkosia Tiger Reserve, mostly for women. She also brought in the concept of Eco-Village by transforming one forest dependent-village to a self-dependent one. Odisha's first Canopy Walk was her innovation, which is built by villagers with training under her stewardship. Nature education programmes in ecotourism like poacher-turned-protectors, know your birds and Walk in Jungle have been her brainchild. In 2018, she was the brain behind cracking the pangolin trade racket in central and eastern India after arrest of a wanted international pangolin trader, Shamsuddin Khan. She has authored two books “Birds of Satkosia Landscape” and “Satkosia, the Seen & the Unseen”, which have received wide acclaim. In February 2020, she received the Indian Express Devi Award from the Chief Minister along with 12 other women achievers for her significant contribution to ecotourism. She has proved beyond doubt that a woman is not always an object of sympathy but is an important and an indispensable part of governance and decision making. In an interview to The Pioneer, Anshu Pragyan spoke to Sugyan Choudhury on the occasion of the International Women’s Day.

How easy it is for women to be in forestry sector?

I believe in poet William Wordsworth’s observation on forest that has inspired me to work under the greenwood trees:

“One impulse from a vernal wood

May teach you more of man,

Of moral evil and of good, Than all the sages can”

Women and men both are creations of God; and since years, they have been living on this earth with love and harmony. The approach of both towards execution of their duties or taking care of their responsibilities is the same. But in the sector like forestry, there are certain advantages of being a lady on job. In our State, the forest cover is almost 40% and a majority of the population is dependent on forest and forest produce for their alternative livelihood. They reduce pressure on forest and motivate general public towards wildlife conservation.

What are your interest areas in work field?

As a Government servant, accomplishing duties on time has always been my prime concern. I do photography, sometimes write. I have two book publications till now. On holidays, I do birding too. A good book sometimes is my favourite companion. Working with people for a developmental cause has always been the main charm in Government services.

Ecotourism being new subject in Odisha, how could you make the Badmul Ecotourism project successful in a small duration?

Credit for the success this project goes to the hardworking community members working over there. As a Government servant, I have only given my best in fulfilling the requirement of the landscape. Ecotourism has multidimensional impact on society and also on forest. Odisha is rich in forests and wildlife resources, beautiful valleys, sky-touching mountains, mesmerising rivers and thousand of streams all over. Because of ecotourism, people from all over the world are getting a chance to visit Odisha and witness its diversity. The Badmul project overlooking the Satkosia gorge started during 2016 with three tented accommodations run by eight villagers. Now, the project stands with 19 tents and cottages managed by 34 villagers benefitting eight 8 to 10 riverine villages of Nayagarh district. It has turned to be favourite place for backpackers and novelists. Gradually, the turnover of the project increased from 4 lakh in 2016 to 1 crore during 2019. Of course, this success has been possible because of the hard work of the community members and cooperation of local public. I would thank all forest staffs, who completed the work in time and with transparency. Any person may go to Badmul and ask the villagers the reason of their success; and they will say it is hard work and transparency which has changed their lives.

Has it been an innovative work?

It is mostly the requirement of landscape according to which we design different projects while working for an ecotourism project, ideas shared by the local people. Of course, the silence of forest too brings in new thoughts sometimes.

How far does the State Government accommodate innovation?

Any innovative work beneficial for our people has always been a yes from the Government.

How much can ecotourism tone up the economy of the State?

The Odisha model of ecotourism is a community-based model in which a major share of the revenue generated goes back to the community itself. Many women are employed in different ecotourism destinations now. It has been an alternative income for the forest-dependant communities who were earlier dependent on poaching, smuggling, fishing, collecting honey, firewood, etc., for their survival. Through ecotourism, they are now able to sustain their livelihoods. Our State’s ecotourism model is people-centric. Beside supporting the State’s economy, ecotourism is the only way to invite tourists from different parts of the world to see the captivating beauty which our State is having.

What is the role of women in ecotourism?

Our Indian culture has always believed in the strength a women carries. In this changing world where women are found bringing positive results in different sectors of the society, ecotourism has emerged as an area which supports both livelihood and conservation. It is the women in remote areas who have conserved forests since ages. Now, who can better speak about the interesting factsof nature and secrets of wilderness to the tourists other than women themselves! Yes, it is the women who are the backbone of this project.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/women-are-the-backbone-of-ecotourism-projects.html

7,18-3-20,Free up the labour market,"Most laws governing the country are either archaic or not in sync with present-day realities. First and foremost, there’s a need to revisit employment rules

Since 1991, a lot has been said, written and debated ad lib about liberalisation, globalisation and ease of doing business. However, not much has been said about the need to free the employment market. Discussions on a new/alternative labour laws do take place. So do talks on the need to revise minimum wages. Do we not realise that tinkering of this nature would take the economy nowhere? Time and again, Governments raise the minimum wages to seek applause. Some labour or trade union leaders do clap but that would be about it. Such moves do not increase employment. If anything paradoxically, they bring down wages.

The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, has been the guiding code of all employment, except for the uppermost layer of officers and executives. When the Act was passed, it was intended essentially for workers by the then Government. Because of the low salaries prevailing then, clerical staff got included. In the absence of any other guidelines, the situation has degenerated to the extent that any employee can file a suit in a labour court. As a result, every responsible employer thinks not twice but thrice before making appointments at Class II, III or IV levels. As far as the number of jobs is concerned, it is these categories that are critical. Employers, up to a point, take shelter in outsourcing. However, such proxy appointments can hardly be a help in generating jobs on a national scale.

If one wants to see glaring examples of what damage the Industrial Disputes Act and its corollaries have done in India, one may visit West Bengal. This State, which was once India’s leading industrial province, has become a graveyard of industries. Kerala is another State, which is also a cemetery of industries, albeit a smaller one, because the Industrial Disputes Act-inspired trade unionism stopped the State’s economic growth early in its tracks. In the heyday of monopolies and restrictive trade practices, a majority of large business houses were headquartered in Kolkata. The Industrial Disputes Act-bred trade unionism effectively chased them out. It is, therefore, time that India reconsiders the Industrial Disputes Act.

Prima facie, unions are meant to protect and promote the welfare of their member workers. As it happens, most unions are affiliated to one political party or the other. Their leaders have political ambitions. In the bargain, the priority of their loyalty may be the party. Moreover, fundamentally, the strength of a trade union lies in the number of its members; their welfare is a lower priority. Further, the concept of the worker’s union is traced to the desire for revolution; aid and abet to bring down bourgeois institutions.

A paradox of the Indian scenario is its high population and, hence, the consolation of a demographic dividend on the one hand, and minimum wages declared by State Governments plus the laws and labour courts being prejudiced against employers. The other paradox is the national outcry for more jobs. None of the points we have made so far help achieve greater employment. If anything, they actually shrink the prospects for employment.

Three years ago, a Morgan Stanley report had stated that India’s labour laws force firms either to remain small, employing fewer workers or to use capital-intensive technology. No wonder, the share of India’s manufacturing sector in GDP terms is one of the lowest among emerging markets. India’s track record in creating productive jobs has been poor.

How can there be any productive job growth if the country’s labour market is shackled with regulations made 60 or 70 years ago? Another factor so far overlooked is that work itself is a training as well as experience. Even if a youngster has missed sufficient schooling, his early start in a job can offset the disadvantage to a significant extent. On the other hand, if he/she has to be without work for several years, he/she would lose self confidence, learn little and lack experience, which is a springboard for building a career, however humble. An idle mind is a devil’s workshop is an old truism. The imposition of a minimum wage ignores this old wisdom. In assuring one person with a comfortable wage, it ruins up to nine potential careers. These nine include those who remain jobless merely because the minimum wage stifles the growth of the economy.

There was a time when an unemployed person could live off his family, which in turn depended on farming its land. But now, with increased population and a reduction in the size of most farms, this alternative for a man without a job or income is no longer there; it would be difficult to survive. Therefore, some income is a must. A low wage is better than no wage. The flip side of this situation should be an encouragement to entrepreneurs. Demand for handmade goods, especially in the affluent world, is believed to be limitless, provided it is not too expensive.

Labour law is a concurrent subject under the Indian Constitution. Thus, both the Central and State Governments have the right to formulate laws on the subject, which means multiplicity of laws, at times with overlapping jurisdictions.

For example, there are 44 Central laws and about 160 State laws on the issue of labour (source: ILO, 2013). Most are archaic, dating to pre-independence era. There is an urgent need to overhaul these laws to attune them to present realities. There are multiple laws governing a single area. For instance, there are 19 laws governing conditions of work and industrial relations, 14 laws on social security and labour welfare, among others.

It is, therefore, advisable to scrap all these laws, including the Industrial Disputes Act. In their place, a worker contract Bill should be passed, which would be between an employer and an employee, as per their mutually agreeable wishes, including the salary/wage. The only universal condition should be that 25 per cent of this salary should be handed over as a draft of a public sector bank, payable exactly five years later. These drafts, month by month, would be the employee’s post-employment benefits. This is to assure him/her that even if the employer closes down, the benefits are safe. Otherwise, there should be total freedom, which would enable numerous projects, especially labour-intensive, to mushroom and bloom.

8,18-3-20,Are we testing enough?,"The Govt has adopted a reasoned approach of random sampling to not waste test kits but we need more centres

Four months into the spread of the deadly Coronavirus, given the humongous toll it has taken globally, most nations will agree that fighting it requires not just preventive but containment measures, too. Ever since the spread of COVID-19, Governments have taken difficult yet complex decisions but the operational protocol followed by each one of them has been varied and tailored to local contexts. In China and Italy, mass quarantines and lockdowns have been resorted to. On the other hand, South Korea and Taiwan, which were badly hit, too, adopted a focussed contagion action plan, which involved a combination of aggressive testing and high levels of information dissemination besides disinfection protocols. The most vital for the containment of any viral outbreak is to follow Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) as confusion can worsen the consequences. The South Korean model is now being touted as the most consistent. As a result, when the country saw a 200 per cent jump in numbers, it had a system at hand that could assess 10,000 people a day. The Korean Government was also quick to scale its testing services, reaching the last mile. Their safety procedures extended all the way to the air-conditioning systems in cars. They even set up drive-through test stations. So the big question now is should India go for the aggressive testing method as assessment right now is based on solely travel-history related cases? And although the Government is considering random tests to find out the extent of community-level percolation and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is still hopeful that we have not entered Stage III, fact is we have tested the lowest samples globally, about 6,000 to 7,000. Compare this with South Korea, which has a lesser population than Tamil Nadu but has tested 250,000. There is a huge difference, leading to questions about the accuracy of the number as a result of inadequate testing. Some more accredited testing centres will be added by the end of the week to the 72 ICMR has but it is time to involve the private sector. And now. The Government has set up rapid testing laboratories that can scan 1,400 samples per day. But this is not enough. The ICMR is also reaching out to engage private labs.

Admittedly, so far, the sole focus has been on containment than mitigation. In the absence of testing, COVID-19 can manifest itself as an aggressive form of any flu with respiratory distress and avoid detection altogether. At the same time, a panic economy has meant that our limited test kits could go futile with unsorted suspects and stretch our existing medical infrastructure. Wasting test kits could mean equally eliminating the chances of identifying more transmission-based cases. This is why the ICMR has decided to monitor community transmission by random sampling. The Government currently has 1.5 lakh testing kits, with a capacity of roughly 6,000 tests per day, and has ordered one million more. But given the density of our population and even a tendency of the affected to hide their condition than adopt strict self-quarantine measures, the private sector, should be roped in to widen the sampling process. Yes, affordability could still be an issue but perhaps this can be a matter of choice for those opting to go for these tests. And if CSR means anything, then big chain hospitals should offer concessional rates. Already a Chennai-based firm is awaiting the Government’s nod to roll out standardised kits. We need to have at least one testing centre in every district hospital. And we can suitably channelise manpower at the health centre level to conduct routine processes. The daily capacity and the turnaround time of testing kits need to be scaled drastically. Also, perhaps, the testing gambit could be increased to include patients with distinct pneumonic symptoms. We have contained but now need to test more to break the cycle of infection. But the truth of the matter is that the success of every aggressive measure is heavily dependent on public cooperation and voluntary submissions. Also, social distancing doesn’t mean being elitist about your circle and cracking down on the service class. Right now, chances are the well-heeled with their travel histories and ecosystem pass this on to the lower classes. This is why a cooperative culture is a sine qua non for any contagion plan.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/are-we-testing-enough--2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/are-we-testing-enough-.html
9,18-3-20,Smooth sail for women,"Supreme Court grants permanent commission to women officers in the Navy

In its continuing effort to foster gender neutrality in the Indian defence forces, the Supreme Court granted permanent commission to women officers serving in the Indian Navy, just a month after it ruled in favour of the same right to women officers in the Army. This means that an officer is entitled to serve in the Navy till he/she retires unlike the 10 year short-service commission (SSC), which can at best be extended to 14 years. Incidentally, in a reflection of the age-old biases in the military, male officers were entitled to both short service and permanent commissions. Ruling that both men and women officers should be treated equally in the defence forces, the apex court ordered that serving woman officers’ applications for permanent commission should be considered within three months, with increments. However, the court said that the consideration would be based on the availability of vacancies, which might leave the door open for those in power to stymie efforts by serving women officers to bridge the gender gap.

The apex court’s decision will end a discriminatory policy that was unfair to women officers on two levels. First, the move will give women the same rights and perks as male officers. So far, not only were they losing out on career opportunities because of the discriminatory practice, they had also been deprived of pension because of the forced SSC. This is because to be eligible for pension in the armed forces, one requires a minimum of 20 years of service. Second, it will go a long way in opening up career opportunities for women who are already serving in the Navy. Till now, according to a skewed policy decision taken by the Centre in 2008 which defied all logic, permanent commission was allowed prospectively to women officers, but denied to serving ones. The Navy has long been a male preserve and in the seafaring universe women have always been unwelcome. Worldwide for centuries, having a woman on board a ship was taboo. Even now, though the global shipping industry has been penetrated by women where the land offices are concerned, the number of women employees onboard ships is a minuscule two per cent. And women Captains have mostly been accepted in the civil cruise industry. Fact is, women officers, with their multi-tasking abilities, may turn out better in running close unit operations. On Tuesday, too, the Supreme Court tore into the flimsy excuse of unavailability of washrooms for women in the Indian Navy’s Russian-made ships and alleged “physiological limitations of woman officers” saying it was a clear “case of gender stereotypes” when “women can sail with same efficiency as male officers.” We must not confine women sailors to tokenisms like the 2017 Navika Sagar Parikrama where a six-member all-woman military team had sailed to circumnavigate the globe and covered more than 21,600 nautical miles. The court should not be reminding us of a mindset change in the evolutionary flow of changing times, we should execute changes ourselves.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/smooth-sail-for-women-2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/smooth-sail-for-women.html
10,18-3-20,Capitalise on our strengths,"As India aims to acquire better global rankings, policymakers must develop regional centres of excellence in education based on local trends, proclivities, resources and history

British educationist Alick Maclean undertook arguably one of the earliest attempts at producing a university ranking system. Maclean’s study Where We Get Our Best Men (1900), which betrays the late Victorian England’s obsession with its own laurels, remained unnoticed outside the university circuits in England. However, more than a hundred years later, the context, connotations and the scope of such rankings have changed dramatically. With the inclusion of higher education as an “internationally traded” service in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), universities have become commodities that must sell to sustain themselves in a globally-competitive education industry. Rankings are loudly advertised and have become the very touchstone of marketability. Even in a welfare State like India, where the bulk of higher education is Government-aided and therefore beyond the pale of market vagaries, there has been, of late, a near-feverish fixation with rankings. And while (because) Indian universities weren’t performing too well at Times Higher Education Supplement (THES), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) or Webometrics world rankings, we introduced leagues of our own in the form of National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF). To many of the stakeholders, “ranking” is an unwarranted western import which puts the institutions of developing countries at a natural disadvantage.

With their emphasis on measuring research output in terms of publications in English language journals, the global system of accreditation perpetuates the dominance of Anglo-American and to a lesser extent, European institutions. Besides the system of peer-review and mutual-referencing aren’t the most transparent of academic practices. Since the Government appears keen on incrementally linking an institution’s domestic and international standings with the volume and the manner of funding, some even suspect that the entire hoopla is a decoy for privatisation. And then there are those critics who believe that at a time when the majority of university graduates, as highlighted in the Government’s own findings, are unemployable, our pursuit of global stature reeks of waylaid competitive nationalism, hollow chest-thumping and the general lethargy of a stagnated eduction sector. They argue, with some merit, that it would profit the universities more if the staff are mobilised towards research and teaching instead of tedious report compilation. Till a few years ago, before the launch of NAAC and NIRF, many believed that better rankings accrue from user-friendly websites and perception management.

Under the circumstances, quality becomes a procedural casualty and our estimation of a university’s true worth, based on a set of universal parameters, remains delusional and misleading. For example, in several assessment paradigms, the share of international faculty and foreign students substantially propels an institution’s ranking. While this may not be the strength of Indian universities, not many countries of the world can boast of a higher education system which is more committed to affirmative action and social inclusion, than our own.

The massification of education and steep rise in enrollment rates may not deliver immediate dividends but these steps will see India rise as a leader in research and development (R&D) in times to come. Fortunately, the NIRF identifies an institution’s inclusivity at the levels of region, class, gender and physical disability as a parameter in quality assessment. But there are, as yet, no points for diversity in faculty.

As India aims to overhaul its higher education infrastructure through a New Education Policy (NEP), creating world-class institutes of eminence (IoEs) and acquiring better global rankings appear to be two of the priorities. It is expected that resources generated through public private partnership (PPP) and introduction of industry-centric courses will provide stimulus to these enterprises. The Ministry of Human Resource Development’s (MHRD) pitch for IoEs encourages international outreach. Under the scheme, the 16 designate institutions have been empowered to collaborate with foreign universities and recruit up to 25 per cent of their total faculty strength from outside India.

The success of the much-touted ‘Study in India’ campaign, too, is largely hinged on our ability to create IoEs and secure better ranking. The campaign, if successful, will not only bring revenue but the increase in the number of offshore students would also improve our global stature. The degree of internationalisation of higher education, which is partly consequent upon global ranking, will certainly augment India’s soft power. The Government’s website on the initiative lists instruction in English medium, the size of India’s market, recent start-up culture and pluralist campuses as our strengths. But when we leverage our educational infrastructure to entice the global student community, we need to ask the following question: who are we inviting to study in India and what do we have to offer? Given India’s financial constraints and our social commitment to bring the majority into the fold of higher education, planners and policymakers will have to make a series of difficult choices. They will have to choose between scaling a few hand-picked institutions to global stature and making the majority of Central/State universities competitive with respect to education infrastructure in Asia and Africa. Let us not forget that as of now, Indian universities cater mostly to students from South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.

In some cases, to the wealthy South Koreans and Africans, too. In terms of their preferred academic destinations in India, these foreign students choose mostly institutions located in metropolitan centres. Therefore, we also need to choose between buttressing the existing patterns of student-inflow and creating regionally diverse centres of learning. Further, we have to decide between promoting subjects which feed the local industry and those that are most sought after in the target countries. If we are to invite students to study in India, when the domestic expectation itself is of a cosmic proportion, we must think of ways of marrying the two prerogatives. A balance must be struck between the strategic need to invite foreign students and delivering on the moral imperatives of the State.

Policymakers need to think of developing regional centres of excellence based on local trends, proclivities, resources and history. Delhi is nearly saturated, so are Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune. India needs to create more hubs, showcasing local strength and areas where Indians excel. To that effect, here is a modest proposal. Institutes based in the north-eastern States can be developed into hubs for training in cottage and small-scale industries. Maharashtra and Gujarat can become centres of commerce and trade education. South India could be developed into India’s science hub while Bengal and Bihar can shine as regions catering to humanities and social sciences. Haryana can do exceptionally well in sports and physical health and Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha can lead global research on tribal knowledge systems and sustainable human ecology. At the same time, we must also think of capitalising on domains of knowledge to which we have had privileged access and that have traditionally been our strength. In subjects such as ayurveda, yoga and mental health, with an untapped global market, we have a lot to offer even to the most advanced countries of the world. There is an ayurvedic medical college in my own nondescript village in Bihar. But over the years, instead of attracting students from other States, let alone from other countries, the institution has shrunk both physically and in terms of footfall. Instead of investing in disciplines where global competition is stiff, the MHRD should think of promoting a few institutes dedicated to indigenous knowledge systems as IoEs. In these areas, the chances of becoming a world leader are bright, realistic and hugely rewarding.

But as we draw these schemes, we must never forget that a lot will depend on the quality of teachers employed at these institutes. Paradoxically, as things stand today, students studying outside India, with their international experience and exposure, are being projected as key to the success of the ‘Study in India’ initiative. We have to put in place a robust system of attracting and retaining talented students and teachers. Given the current state of affairs, appointment of teachers would be a good beginning point. Unless we engage and strengthen our workforce, these schemes will be reduced to corporate style weekend workshops on capacity building that offer nothing but a distraction from monotony.

11,18-3-20,"Guard your health and wealth, too","In times of such global anxiety as unleashed by the Coronavirus, it is vital for people to secure themselves financially

The world is facing a pandemic, the kind of which we have not seen in recent history. The Coronavirus, which began in Wuhan, China, has now hit over 145 countries, with over 188,433 confirmed cases globally and around 7,500 deaths. Of this, China, Italy, Iran and Spain have reported the highest number of cases and casualties. Naturally, productivity levels have come down drastically with China, the hotbed of the Coronavirus reporting a fall of 13.5 per cent in its factory activity. As far as American economic data is concerned, the manufacturing activity in New York State also fell to its lowest level since 2009. Similarly, stock markets have also plummeted worldwide despite major Central banks offering lifelines in the form of rate cuts. The Dow Jones, reacting to US President Donald Trump’s comments regarding a “possible recession” tanked about 13 per cent on March 16, with London’s Financial Times Stock Exchange along with other major European markets recording a four per cent slide. Indian stock markets have also sunk due to panic selling. The Sensex and the Nifty broke the lower circuit this week when both indices fell 10 per cent each, immediately after the bourses opened. Given the ongoing global chaos and uncertainty, it is not possible to predict the movement of stock markets as this fall worldwide does not have any precedent. No one knows how long the Coronavirus epidemic will continue. In times of such global anxiety it is vital for people to secure themselves financially. Here are some ways to do so.

Do not overreact and sell in panic: It is generally seen that investors are not rational in their outlook, follow a herd mentality and fall prey to panic selling. It is important to be fully aware of the natural cognitive and emotional bias that we may be experiencing and overcome it. Investors must rationalise, based on technicality. Generally, the stocks always move upwards in the long-term, although there can be short-term downturns. However, there could be times when selling becomes necessary when the fundamentals change drastically. So, although it is too early to panic and sell our investments in the stock markets, taking a U-turn and selling when the fundamentals of the economy or the business environment are changing, could be prudent. But is it a good time to buy? Nobody knows what is the bottom of this market. So any risk-taking individual can start investing in a proportion of funds over time. Set up a weekly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of the amount you are comfortable with and try not to panic if the markets fall further during this time. In this way, an investor with high risk tolerance can take advantage of rupee cost averaging.

Emergency funds and cash in hand: Although investments in stock markets and other instruments are an important way of achieving financial goals, it is important to create an emergency fund if you do not have one already. Investors can also think of enhancing their existing emergency funds as it provides the required cushion and peace of mind to deal with uncertainties. It is advisable to move some investments from the stock markets and fixed saving instruments into saving accounts to meet any untoward expenses. With schools, colleges, malls, organisations and places of worship shutting down, there could be a possibility of banks closing down for a brief period in the future. So keeping extra cash in hand and at a reasonably safe place, is advisable.

Safeguard your job: Although many people have started to work from home already and many may follow soon, this is the time for people to toil hard for the benefit of the organisation they work for. It is important to realise that in these times of economic upheaval and the current global turmoil due to the pandemic, you are lucky to have a job that can pay your bills. It is a very difficult time for freelancers, the aviation and tourism sector and for those who earn their living through the MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) industry and so on. So, work hard to safeguard your job and plan your finances carefully to help you tide over the present crisis.

Cut expenses and look for opportunities to save: It is practical to look at all opportunities to save, since most of the social outings like pubbing, clubbing, eating out, watching movies and shopping have become out of bounds. This is a good time to relax and reflect on recent purchases and contemplate on unnecessary expenses that can be curbed in the future, too. It is also important to halt any expenditure that requires high cash outlay for some time and see how the situation changes.

Kickstart emergency plans: Many of us might have invested in the stock markets for our childrens’ higher education or marriage expenses and so on. For such immediate needs, which cannot wait for the stock markets to stop falling, stabilise and then start their upward journey, a “Plan B” should be worked out at the earliest.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared Covid-19 as a global pandemic as it has spread worldwide and affected our lives, social norms and economic parameters. However, as individual investors, we should resist the temptation to panic and think rationally regarding our investments. With some smart planning and handy emergency funds, it is possible to tide over these troubled times. Remember the old adage, “Health is wealth.” So, first take care of your health and then focus on your wealth.

12,18-3-20,We can just wait and watch,"Fear of the unknown is powerful and Coronavirus still remains unfamiliar. SARS took about six months to stop, largely through public health measures. Being the second-most populous country in the world India has cause to worry but there’s no need to panic

A clear picture of the full ramifications of the extraordinary Coronavirus outbreak is yet to emerge. Till about two weeks ago the virus was just a news story but now, it has touched all our lives. Right from work, play, entertainment, the right to pray and to “what is for dinner today”, every aspect of the common man’s life has been affected. It has changed normal routines and many are now working from home. Students are on a forced holiday and irritable as they have largely been confined to home by schools and institutions of higher education shutting down. Even those staying in hostels have been told to pack up and go home. Worried parents have themselves given up socialising, going to restaurants or the cinema. It has also resulted in an unprecedented focus on health and hygiene, not just in the public sphere but also in our private space. Authorities have issued numerous public health advisories and dos and don’ts to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus. Right now, the situation seems to be spiralling out of control and as of now no end is in sight.

But this should not result in panic. It is indeed a good thing that the Government has declared it as a “national calamity” and the States and the Centre are working in tandem to check the spread of the dreaded virus. The number of confirmed cases in India has risen to 137, with three casualties, according to the Health Ministry’s data. As the number grows daily, many businesses have closed, there is mayhem on the stock market, hospitals are overflowing with patients and even the movie industry has postponed new film releases with movie halls being shut temporarily. It will certainly take a long time for the country to recover from the effect of this pandemic.

Even the gods have not been spared, say media reports. Apparently “fearing” that the deities, too, could be infected with the Coronavirus, the priests of a famous temple in Uttar Pradesh have covered them with masks and asked the devotees to clean their hands with sanitizers before touching the idols. Some like the Swaminarayan temple have been shut indefinitely. For the first time, the centuries old Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam has cancelled major services.

Interestingly, the Coronavirus has come as a blessing in disguise for the Narendra Modi Government as it has pushed almost all other burning issues to the background. Politically important issues like the flailing economy, the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, the Delhi riots and so on, have been put on the back-burner. Even in Parliament the debate on the anti-CAA protests was not as stormy as expected. The Modi Government got away with muted attacks, though the former Congress president Rahul Gandhi continues his tirade against the Centre on the sliding economy.

Coronavirus is taking a toll on economic activities around the world as the entire supply chain continues to be affected and major global events are either being cancelled or postponed. The impact on the Indian economy is going to be much worse now, though the Government is yet to come up with an assessment.

Indian economists are worried that the Coronavirus outbreak could drag growth in the current January-March quarter and the next financial. The Government has projected five per cent growth in the current financial year and the projected growth for the next fiscal, starting April 2020-21 has been pegged at six per cent to 6.5 per cent.

The manufacturing industry, the real estate sector, the aviation and hospitality industry, major sports events and almost every segment of economic activity has seen a downtrend. Airline tickets and hotel bookings are going at almost half price.The $46 billion global cruise industry is also watching the Coronavirus outbreak nervously. If the spread of the disease isn’t contained soon, it could even affect the advertising and marketing spends of brands.

The Reserve Bank of India Governor, Shaktikanta Das recently warned that the pharma and electronic manufacturing sectors might get impacted due to the virus and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is likely to go down further. He said that the Coronavirus outbreak appears to be worse than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and this time China’s share in the world GDP and trade is much higher. Indian IT companies depend on Shanghai and Beijing and the big picture points to the fact that many existing projects might not be completed. India’s leading automakers — Mahindra, Tata Motors and Hero MotoCorp — admit that the Coronavirus outbreak has hit production and supply of spare parts. The sector saw sales decline by 15 per cent in the April-January period.

Fear of the unknown is powerful and the virus still remains alien. SARS took about six months to stop, largely through public health measures. Being the second-most populous country in the world, India has cause to worry but there should be no panic. Coronavirus is an evolving disease and we have no other option than to wait ad watch.

17,18-3-20,Birla Tyres workers threaten mass immolation,"The suspended workers of Birla Tyres have threatened mass immolation in front of the plant if their grievances were not addressed by the State Government by March 30 .

As many as 11 suspended workers said that they were under suspension for last 18 months and despite appealing to authorities at different levels including the Labour Department Minister, Secretary and the district Collector, there was no result.

Neither their suspension orders were revoked nor they were allowed to work, they alleged, adding that they were in abject penury having no other means of eking out livelihoods.

They said in a statement that the company used to give bonus and festival advances before Durga Puja in each year.

Yet in year 2018 the bonus for the finical year 2017-18 and festival advances were given by the management only after labour unions sat on dharana.

Although the dharana was withdrawn following intervention of the then district Collector assuring the agitators to look into their demands in presence of the company officials, yet in the subsequent stage the management suspended 11 workers who were in the agitation.

Since then, although they have been running from pillar to post for revocation of their suspensions yet they didn’t get any relief, they said.

The villagers demanded that the road be completed and they were ready to cooperate for it. The EE informed that lands of two out of six owners had been acquired. ""Payment has been released to these two legal holders, but in the rest of the cases the acquisition was not possible because the legal holders are many. Funds required for acquiring the land have already been placed with the Land Acquisition Office, but they could not proceed because the land to be acquired is in a joint patta. All the members, who are legal holders of the patta have to be present,"" informed the EE.

“It has already been highlighted by different media platforms that masks and sanitizers of branded companies are yet to be provided to medicos and field staff in the Health Department that is supposed to launch a decisive awareness drive, substandard material is being marketed across the State as per the media reports,” he said.

Jakhar said: “You might have also gone through the reports that garbage dumps had piled up in some towns and metropolitan cities due to strike by sanitation staff or other reasons. While the experts were putting emphasis on personal hygiene as primary measure to prevent attack by coronavirus, lakhs of people were forced by the situation to pass through dirty water that had accumulated in residential colonies many towns and garbage dumped on roads.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-closes-malls--mandis--museums-till-mar-31.html

When the BJP high command chose Rawat for the coveted post of CM by sidelining stalwarts like Major General (Retd) B C Khanduri, Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ many expressed apprehensions over the choice.

However in the last three years Rawat has proven his detractors wrong and taken bold decisions like making Gairsain the summer capital and creation of Char Dham Devsthanam board.

In an interaction with Gajendra Singh Negi of The Pioneer, he highlighted the achievements of his government and his plans for future. Here are the excerpts.

How do you rate performance of your Government in last three years?

Our Government has taken the state on the fast track of development. I can claim that in last three years we have fulfilled 75 percent of the promises made in our vision document which the party released ahead of assembly elections. This is a big achievement. We have performed splendidly in Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes and got second position in the country in this respect.

We have adopted e- office system and started holding e -cabinets. The files are moving at a fast pace now. We have curtailed the seven desk system of file movement to four in secretariat. We have taken historical decision of constituting Char Dham Devsthanam board. I can claim with conviction that these three years would weigh heavy on the past ten years.

Corruption was a major issue on which your party targeted Congress in assembly elections. How your Government has tackled it?

Our government has adopted zero tolerance on corruption and it has yielded results. The corruption has reduced in governance. We have made the fourth floor (CM secretariat) free from the mafia. The mafia around the ministers is also finished.

How has the double engine government benefited Uttarakhand?

Ours is a triple engine government. With the help of union government, the all weather road and Rishikesh- Karnprayag rail link projects are going on at fast pace. Dehradun- Delhi expressway is also on anvil.

What is the status of agriculture sector and farmers in the state?

We are focusing on increasing the income of farmers and for it we are providing interest free loans to farmers and the farmer groups. The state has saved chemical fertilizers worth Rs 188 crore by adopting soil health cards. We are focusing on timely payment of farmers.

The State has launched Atal Ayushman Uttarakhand Yojana (AAUY) in health sector but is it facing implementation problems?

We have made certain changes like removing the referral system in AAUY. More than 1.2 lakh people have benefited from the scheme and 12000 life saving operations have been done.

Under the GST regime, the central government compensation to states would cease after 2022. What are the plans of the state to meet this challenge?

We are focusing on service sector to augment our income. The state is promoting Pirul (pine needle) based and solar power projects. My government is developing 83 growth centres in the state. The home stay scheme is also receiving very good response.

The opposition is targeting your government for failing to provide employment; what is the government doing for employment generation?

In last three years we have created 4 lakh new jobs. From investor’s summit alone 57000 jobs were created. Yes, the recruitment process in government jobs has got affected due to legal and other issues but we are sorting them out.

What is your Government’s plan for Kumbh Mela -2021?

We preparing for a mega Kumbh Mela. All the works barring one would be completed before December this year.

53,18-3-20,Cong betrayed people in 3 yrs of rule: Sukhbir Badal,"Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal on Tuesday alleged that the Congress was “squarely responsible for the desecration of religious texts” in Punjab.

He alleged that the incidents of the desecration of religious texts were a “part of a deep-rooted conspiracy to defame” the then SAD-BJP government ahead of the 2017 assembly elections. “Subsequent events have provided categorical and convincing evidence of the Congress hand in the conspiracy. The version of the key witness Surjit Singh (in the 2015 Behbal Kalan police firing incident at Faridkot) unnerved the Congress Government as they knew that this would lead the trail to their house,” he alleged.

“That is why they brazenly and shamelessly tried to destroy the evidence by putting pressure on the key witnesses to change his version, leading to his death under psychological stress,” he said.

Surjit Singh’s widow and Akalis have all along been naming Cabinet Minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar and Coongress MLA Kushaldeep Singh Kiki Dhillon of mounting pressure on Surjit Singh for not deposing as a witness in this case to save some accused. Surjit had died of cardiac arrest on January 13, this year. “Congress clearly panicked and deputed its key leaders Gurpreet Singh Kangar and Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon to browbeat and force key eye-witnesses not to speak the truth and to change their earlier version...The statements made by the deceased’s wife Jasbir Kaur, have thoroughly exposed the Congress,” said Sukhbir.

“My simple question is why does the Congress government wanted to suppress the truth? Why is the CM not acting against Dhillon and Kangar? Why is the poor wife of the key witness being denied justice?” he asked.

SUKHBIR’S FIVE POSERS FOR CAPT

Attacking the Congress Government a day after it highlighted its achievements on the completion of three years in office, the SAD chief dubbed the party rule as the period of betrayal marked by the neglect of people.

Posing five questions to the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Sukhbir dared him to name a single development or welfare scheme launched by Congress Government in three yearsm while also asking how many hours the Chief Minister attended his office, and how many times he visited Punjab’s areas. Sukhbir accused the Chief Minister of “cheating” farmers on debt waiver, betraying the youth in the name of jobs, cellphones and Rs 2,500 unemployment allowance every month.

“This is a period when the people of Punjab got nothing except betrayal, indifference and neglect at the hands of a power-drunk and arrogant ruler who humiliated Punjabis, treating even meeting people below his royal dignity,” alleged Sukhbir.

Attacking the Chief Minister for being “inaccessible”, SAD president asked how many times Capt Amarinder Singh toured the State and enquired about people’s problems. “In the past three years of the Congress rule, the state remained headless with no government visible either in the civil secretariat or in villages, towns and cities,” he said.

“How many times in these three years have you been to your office or to your state or how many times have you been even to the sacred Harmandar Sahib and Durgiana Temple to seek blessings of the Almighty,” Sukhbir asked the Chief Minister.

He said that the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh “lied shamelessly” in the name of the great ‘Guru Sahiban’, taking a “false oath” in the name of Guru Gobind Singh, “only to cheat farmers” on debt waiver and jobs to suicide-hit

families.

Stating that the Congress Government has “not fulfilled” any promise made to people, Badal said: “Forget implementing the Rs 90,000-crore farm loan waiver, the government has not even released one rupee to any farmer from the Rs 3,000 crore allocated for loan waiver in the last year’s budget.”

He alleged that during the Congress rule, all promises remained “unfulfilled” due to which people suffered.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-betrayed-people-in-3-yrs-of-rule--sukhbir-badal.html
54,18-3-20,Khattar explores possibility of constructing a dam,"Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday visited the Hathni Kund Barrage area and viewed the proposal to construct a new dam with a more water-holding capacity on Yamuna

River. To explore the proposal of constructing a new dam with more water holding capacity above the Hathni Kund Barrage, Khattar viewed the site and discussed the proposal in detail, with the officials of the Irrigation Department along with the officials of other departments.

An official spokesperson said that during his visit, the Chief Minister discussed the proposed layout plan of constructing a new dam above Hathni Kund Barrage.

After going through the layout plan, the Chief Minister visited the rest house of the forest department at village Madho Bans and inspected the proposed area while standing on the bank of Yamuna River.

The Chief Minister said the State government has been planning to acquire land of some villages of Himachal Pradesh along with village Kalesar, Madho Bans and Banjara Bans, to construct a dam with higher water holding capacity to prevent the nearby areas from flood-like situations during the heavy rains as the flow of the water is not allowed in the canals during the rains and the possibility of flood-like situation increases while releasing water in the Yamuna River from Hathni Kund Barrage.

He said the proposal of constructing the dam will also be discussed with the Government of Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

Khattar instructed the senior officials of the Irrigation Department of Haryana during the meeting that there is heavy rainfall in the mountains and glaciers also melt during summers and the water goes waste in the rivers during the rainy season which arises the flood-like situations, so the proposal of constructing a big dam above the Hathni Kund Barrage on the Yamuna river, should be inspected before initiating the work plan of constructing the dam.

He said in southern Haryana, the canal irrigation system can be strengthened by constructing the dams. Moreover, Hydroelectric power houses can also be built on these dams, The Chief Minister added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/khattar-explores-possibility-of-constructing-a-dam.html
55,18-3-20,"Do you even know what agriculture is, Punjab CM asks Sitharaman","Taking on the Central Government for failing to stand by Punjab farmers who had saved the nation from hunger, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday declared that his Government will not allow ‘kurki’ of the land of the beleaguered farmers, who had been trapped by the banks in vicious cycles of loans and mortgage.

Chief Minister, at a conclave to mark the third anniversary of Congress Government, dismissed the Centre’s promise of doubling farmers’ income as mere hogwash in the absence of any concrete steps. “Does the Union Finance Minister even know what agriculture is all about?,” he quipped, demanding that she should explain what the Centre planned to do to boost farm income, after first ensuring that every grain of Punjab is lifted and not allowed to rot in the godowns.

Taking another dig at Sitharaman, Capt Amarinder said later, in response to a question, that while he could not reel out figures like her, he was confident that given the right atmosphere and assistance, Punjab’s hardworking farmers and industry could increase their incomes on their own.

Referring to reports that the Centre was mulling doing away with MSP for crops, he suggested that if they felt there were now enough stocks of paddy and wheat, they should extend MSP to alternative crops instead of simply dumping the farmers of Punjab who were responsible for giving India its food security.

“The Centre has to help out the farmers, it has to support diversification,” said Capt Amarinder, making a strong case for Central support to Punjab’s farming community. “Punjab stood by you, now you have to stand by it by supporting our program of diversification,” he asserted.

The Chief Minister lashed out at the Central Government for forgetting that when India was dying of hunger, it was Punjab that came to the nation’s rescue. “Agriculture has to be patronized...Where will Punjab go if the Centre does not support us in either agricultural development or industrialisation?” he asked.

Pointing out that Punjab has no land and has to find ways to make agriculture profitable for small land holdings through horticulture and other diversification methods, just as Japan has done, the Chief Minister said that while his Government was experimenting with cultivation of fruits, that would take time and the Centre needed to support the farmers in the interim.

In the context of huge farm debts, Capt Amarinder described banks as the root of evil, having lent out more money than was permissible by mortgaging the land and properties of farmers, who also started using this money for non-productive reasons.

“It is important to help these farmers...Punjab Government is already giving the maximum debt waiver, notwithstanding its poor state of finances, much more needed to be done,” he added.

Lamenting the dwindling water resources in the state, the Chief Minister reiterated that Punjab had no surplus water to share as the groundwater levels were precariously low and the government was now trying to get river water to major cities even for drinking purposes.

While Israeli company Mekorot was helping Punjab, the state was at a disadvantage as it had no sea water to use by desalinating, said the Chief Minister, adding that Central Government assistance was needed even on this front.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/do-you-even-know-what-agriculture-is--punjab-cm-asks-sitharaman.html

""The ghastly communal violence in Delhi is strongly condemned and a court-monitored, independent investigation into these crimes must be conducted in a time-bound fashion. The perpetrators of this violence must be severely punished under law.

Speaking on the issues discussed in the party's politburo meeting, he said the politburo strongly condemned the Home Minister's on the usage of face-recognition technology for identifying those responsible for the communal violence. ""The government itself has admitted before the courts that this technology had an accuracy rate of only two per cent in 2018, which dropped to a mere one per cent in 2019, unable to make even a gender distinction.

69,18-3-20,Court dismisses plea of Mukesh,"Mukesh Kumar Singh, one of the convicts in Nirbhaya rape and murder case, application seeking quashing of death penalty was dismissed by a Delhi court on Tuesday. The court even pulled up the ML Sharma, the counsel for making false averments in the court.

Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana dismissed Singh's plea claiming he was not in Delhi on the day of the incident. The plea claimed that Singh was arrested from Rajasthan and brought to Delhi on December 17, 2012, and was not present in the city on December 16, when the crime took place.

""Before parting, the court is constrained to express its anguish regarding the callous manner in which the application at hand has been moved. It is a well known fact that courts of this country are overburdened and are hard pressed for time. The duty to deliver justice expeditiously becomes all the more onerous when the court is dealing with the case of a death row convict when one wrong decision would lead to fatal consequences. Therefore, the expectations of assistance from the Bar is more enhanced and intense.

""There cannot be any quarrel with the proposition that an advocate, to the best of his capabilities, is duty-bound to represent the case of his client before the court. However, the duty cannot be extended to the extent of procuring relief for the client by resorting to all kinds of schemes and stratagems,"" the court said in its order.

It further said that advocate M L Sharma, appearing for Singh, has not only made a false averment before the court but has also miserably failed to discharge his duties as a counsel to bring all the facts for effective dispensation of justice.

""The counsel was not only duty-bound to make false averments but was also under a duty to apprise this court that the plea of convict has already been dealt with by the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court. The duty becomes all the more sacrosanct when viewed against the fact that the death warrants are scheduled to be carried into effect on March 20 and the court required to glean the various judgements of the trial court (237 pages), high court (340 pages) and Supreme Court (315+116 pages),"" the judge said in the order.

The court noted that time is a very precious judicial entity and required to be very sagaciously spent. ""Unfortunately, some mischievous brains have been projecting and consciously nurturing a misplaced notion that there is a premium over dishonesty and mendacity in this country. This court is of the considered opinion that authorities involved in the dispensation of justice are duty-bound to dispel such ill-founded notion. It would be axiomatic to observe that time is a very precious judicial entity and is required to be very sagaciously spent.

""The members of the Bar appearing before the court are duty-bound to render full cooperation and assistance to the court to ensure that justice is delivered expeditiously to the litigants without any unnecessary delay. In these circumstances, I deem it appropriate that the conduct of the counsel for the convict needs to be brought to the notice of the Bar Council of India (BCI) for appropriate sensitisation exercise,"" it said.

During the hearing, the special public prosecutor, appearing for police, opposed the plea and said it was not only frivolous and devoid of any merits, but a mischievous endeavour to stall execution of death sentence scheduled for March 20.

Sharma argued that Singh was lifted by police in the wee hours of December 17, 2012, from Karoli in Rajasthan and this fact was even submitted by one of the prosecution witnesses during the trial.

""Prosecution deliberately concealed documentary evidence regarding lifting of Singh from Karoli just to falsely implicate him in the case. If the prosecution would not have fraudulently withheld documents by the Rajasthan Police and Delhi Police, he would have been pronounced innocent by the court. Fraud vitiates all the proceedings and thus this court should accordingly quash trial court order September 2013 and direct the police to file verification report in the matter,"" the lawyer said.

The plea had claimed that Singh was arrested from Rajasthan and brought to Delhi on December 17, 2012, and was not present in the city on December 16, when the crime took place.

The plea also alleged that Singh was tortured inside the Tihar Jail. On Monday, Mukesh moved the Supreme Court seeking restoration of legal remedies and alleging that his earlier counsel misled and forced him to sign the papers.

The apex court had refused to entertain his plea. On July 9, 2018, the court dismissed his review plea against its judgement. Later, his curative and mercy pleas were rejected by the top court and President Ram Nath Kovind, respectively.

On March 5, a trial court issued fresh warrants for March 20 at 5.30 am, as the date for the execution of convicts Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).

A 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as 'Nirbhaya' (fearless), was gang raped and savagely assaulted in a moving bus in south Delhi on December 16, 2012. She died after a fortnight.

Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused. Ram Singh, the sixth accused, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail days after the trial began in the case.

Instead of spending the last weekend with friends and family at the city malls or eateries, people preferred staying cooped up at home to avoid any mass contact. Employees at various multiplexes and supermarkets have claimed that the footfall since the extended Holi weekend has come down to half.

“On any weekend, it would be quite difficult to manage the crowd especially once the school exams are over in March. But this time people are not spending much time window shopping and are just dropping in to buy the essentials. While on one hand, it is a good sign that everyone is conscious, on the downside it has adversely affected the business,” said an employee at Reliance Mart.

“Sections of the mart like electronics and apparels hardly have any visitors. Since the time malls in New Delhi have been closed, people are here mostly to buy groceries, ready to make food and toiletries. Hand sanitizers have been flying off the shelves,” he added.

Malls too are taking necessary precautions and trying to create as much public awareness as possible. All employees at the Reliance Mart were seen wearing gloves and face masks.

“In this time of crises, it is a very good directive to shut down the movie theatres.

This will undoubtedly hamper the business of the various shops and eating joints but it is also required. At Nucleus Mall, we have been conducting sanitation drives since March 13 and all the staff members have been provided with gloves and masks.

Surfaces like hand rails, glasses, reception desks are being sanitized on a regular basis,” said Bishnu Agarwal, owner of Nucleus Mall.

“Closing of multiplexes is a good move but it has also affected the business to a great extent. Cinema is a major footfall creator for the mall and closing it down will affect the shopping as well as the gaming zone. At JD Hi Street, we are taking as many preventive measures as possible. At the entry point to the mall, visitors are been given hand sanitizers. The staff is also being very vigilant and anyone seen coughing is being asked to stay home,” said the owner of JD Hi Street, Anurag Sarawgi.

“There is no doubt that the shopkeepers and retailers will incur huge loss but this decision has been taken as per the need of the hour.

All business houses support the government with this move taken in the interest of the public at large,” said Immediate past President, Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Deepak Maroo.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/city-malls--parks-wear-deserted-look-after-shutdown.html

I have given Hajat Incharge strict instructions that Hajat for the accused who are brought from the prison for appearances in the courts be neat and clean so as not to pose any problem to the health of the accused at all.”

He further said, “I would be inspecting Hajat too but let me see first how its Incharge respond and act to the instructions given to him.”

When told that prisoners’ van need to be disinfected PDJ Kumar said, “Let me see what best can be done.” Accused from Central Prison Daltonganj are ferried up and down from prison to court’s Hajat and back and the prisoners’ van reminds one of any van of the ancient time.

Here sit the accused and the security personnel. Their sitting is cheek by jowl. One source said the inside condition of the prisoners’ van leaves much to be desired.

A lawyer begging anonymity said, “If you want to see the congested sitting then visit our lawyers’ sitting places where the arm of one lawyer’s chair rubs the arm of the other lawyer’s chair. If a lawyer stretches his leg it is bound to hit the next one sitting opposite to him”.

He said the lawyers’ sitting places except the second floor sitting place here in Daltonganj are dark and crowded where clients and others too make a beeline for legal consultation and briefing. Lawyers’ tables speak of primitivism said this lawyer.

SP Palamu Ajay Linda too has given directives to his police officials to keep lock ups in police stations neat and clean.

Linda said as accused are kept there the lock ups need to be all Ok from health point of view. Officer in charge of Chainpur police station Sunit Kumar said “ I have got our lock up here cleaned.”

96,18-3-20,RO rejects objections raised by Cong against nominations of two BJP RS candidates,"Returning Officer AP Singh on Tuesday rejected the objections raised by the Congress against nominations of two BJP Rajya Sabha candidates, including Jyotiraditya Scindia, after a hearing.

Two Congress candidates for the March 26 Rajya Sabha elections from Madhya Pradesh, Digvijay Singh and Phool Singh Baraiya, on Monday had filed written objections against BJP nominees Scindia and Sumer Singh Solanki, seeking that their nomination papers be rejected on certain grounds.

Following this, AP Singh had asked representatives of Scindia and Solanki to come to his office at 10 AM (on Tuesday) to put forth their views on the objections.

AP Singh, principal secretary of State Assembly, is the returning officer for the Rajya Sabha polls. After hearing, Purushendra Kaurav, the counsel for the BJP candidates, the returning officer junked the Congress objections and accepted the nominations of Scindia and Solanki.

The returning officer accepted the two BJP candidates nominations and rejected the Congress objections over them, said Kaurav, a senior Supreme Court counsel who is a former advocate general of Madhya Pradesh.

Digvijay Singh had petitioned the returning officer, stating Scindia, in his nomination papers, had not furnished details of cases pending against him, Congress leader and advocate JP Dhanopia said on Monday.

Likewise, Baraiya had demanded that Solankis nominations be scrapped as his resignation from the college where he taught was accepted a day after he filed his nomination papers on March 13, he added.

Solanki, who was an assistant professor of history at Shaheed Bheema Nayak Government Postgraduate College, Barwani resigned from his government job on March 12, Dhanopia said.

Baraiya, in his written submission, had said Solanki cannot contest the elections as he filed his nomination papers on March 13 when his resignation was not yet accepted by the college authorities. His resignation was accepted on March 14, he had claimed.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ro-rejects-objections-raised-by-cong-against-nominations-of-two-bjp-rs-candidates.html
97,18-3-20,VC NPU takes stock of 3 colleges after shutdown order,"Vice Chancellor of Nilamber Pitamber University (NPU) reached three constituent colleges in Daltonganj on the day today March 17 when the State Government has asked all shut down till April 14 asking students not to sit arms rubbing each other or noses breathing out simultaneously.

VC SN Singh first visited YSN Mahila college and said, “There were many groups of girls who had their heads too close to each other. I asked them to have some distance for them.”

JS college was his next stop over and here again VC said “ There were tight rows of students submitting their examination forms for final year degree courses examinations and their close proximity to each other was most undesirable at this time of coronavirus fear.”

GLA College was his third stop where things were more in mess. VC said “ I found more than a dozen students there with examination forms in their hands complaining that Hindi department teacher has refused to verify their filled up forms.”

VC said, “This Hindi department here has a constant problem of one or two of its teachers absent on any working day.” Students health approach at all these 3 colleges was a big miss and mess.

On being asked as to for what he rushed to 3 colleges here VC said, “It was to see if students huddle together or sit some separately but my experiences were mixed and worrisome.”

The State Government has shut down colleges but has allowed examination and evaluation to be carried out.

However with NPU the problem is different said VC as here examination dates falling on/ from April 16 have already been notified but for these examinations form filling, fee submission is on but with this closure order this pre examination activity too faces hiccups.

VC said this NPU is to prepare on war footing for that examination which is slated for April 16 and if pre works are not done then in that event NPU can not catch up with its own April 16 date.

VC said “ We understand that these pre examination works be completed in the larger interest of the students and their academic session for which I need the support of teachers, non teaching staff, students and their guardians.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/vc-npu-takes-stock-of-3-colleges-after-shutdown-order.html
98,18-3-20,Shanta Gokhale’s ‘One Foot on the Ground’,"Shanta Gokhale is a Sangeet Natak Award winning doyen of Marathi performing arts and a highly accomplished translator and writer. She’s to Marathi literature and culture what Girish Karnad was for Kannada literary world. With the persistent prodding of novelist Jerry Pinto, her long time collaborator, she has come out with this unusual, yet gripping, autobiography. She tells her story through the events of the body starting with her birth in 1939.

‘She’s going to be a philosopher’, the doctor said when she popped out from her mother’s womb. ‘Why?’, her mother asked weakly. ‘She has put her hand to her forehead and is refusing to bawl’. The good doctor then turned the just-born upside down and slapped her bottom. “Philosophy fled. A lusty bawl filled the air. I had arrived”.

With effortless humour and candour, Shanta Gokhale recounts her life story from childhood and youth to middle and old age through chapters focused around the events of her body. This probably provides her with a writerly space and sequence for telling her story. Gokhale’s early memories are of the ‘great injection chase’ - of having been chased by doctor with a loaded syringe - and of being hoisted on operation table for the removal of the innocuous tonsils. She learns lessons in the girl child’s anatomy after having been groped by the manservant. The author remembers thinking it was no fun being a girl when faced with her first periods.

By the time Gokhale was in seventh standard, her body - and of the other girls in the class - started blooming in diverse ways. Some girls were heavily endowed frontally, attracting untoward male attention, while others had not much to show. “I regarded myself critically in the bedroom mirror to assess my standing in the breasts race. I was, I told myself brutally, amongst the stragglers”. But, “if breasts put me among the stragglers in the race, buttocks put me way ahead” !

The early chapters, aside from the candid humour, quite capture the angst of growing up as female of the species in India.

Shanta Gokhale’s father held one of the top editorial positions at The Indian Nation, a newspaper owned by the Maharaja of Darbhanga and published from Patna. The progressive father had cherished to send her daughter(s) to the UK for studies. Aged seventeen, the author set sail for London in 1956, remained there for five years, and completed degree in English language and literature from Bristol University. England was where she got into her grooves and was sumptuously exposed to literature and performing arts. And it was here that she almost had her first love in Otto, a Norwegian student. The guy’s love for her was total, hers was tentative and petered out eventually.

Back in India, Gokhale married an Indian Navy Lt-Commander Vijay Mohan Shahane and settled into quiet family life. After two children - actress Renuka Shahane and Rhodes scholar turned journalist Girish Shahane - and one-and-a-half decade later, she came out a bitter person from marriage. In filmmaker Arun Khopkar she found her second mate, but the man’s infidelities led to the disintegration of her family life twice over.

The book charmingly chronicles the bitter-sweet journey of a single mother bringing up her children. She traverses the road with aplomb as a teacher of English literature, and also as an editor of Arts pages at Femina and TOI, as a translator from Marathi to English and vice-versa, and as a novelist. All along the journey she accepts her body in all its mystery and recounts her story from menstruation to menopause, from fibroids to full-blown cancer, from glaucoma to cataracts while valiantly facing, and surviving, them all.

And through her bodily memories, emerge others to engage and entertain the reader. Sitting contentedly on the cusp of her eighties, Shanta Gokhale has regret though. The regret is about the curiosity of death that Samuel Beckett had expressed so well: ‘If I was dead, I wouldn’t know I was dead. That’s the only thing I have against death. I want to enjoy death’.

Bridging the gap between commoners and the law enforcement agency, he said, was one of his top priorities.

“We will set up a system in which problems related to law and order will be listed at a local level and addressed. For instance, if a locality is prone to theft, then it will be mentioned in the local police station and necessary steps will be taken to address the issue,” Rao said, adding that at least 10 such problems will be listed for every locality. The system, he said, will be reviewed fortnightly.

A 1987 batch IPS officer, Rao was serving as DG (Fire Services and Home Guards) prior to taking charge as the Jharkhand DGP.

He replaced IPS Kamal Nayan Choubey, who held the top position in the police department here during the recent Lok Sabha as well as Assembly elections.

Addressing media persons on Tuesday, Rao said that satisfaction of complainants will be a priority for the police under his leadership. Participation of citizens in maintaining law and order, he said, will help police do better. “I want to assure accountability and accessibility at every level in the police department. Every person in the department will be answerable and accountable,” Rao added.

The police department, he said, will prepare a public interface platform in order to facilitate communication between cops and the citizens of the State.

Commoners, he said, will also get to send their feedback to the police on various issues, and a suitable medium for this will soon be finalised.

In a bid to keep people updated about the various developments, the department, he said, will release a daily bulletin of all the work done by the department on that day.

Rao also spoke about providing better work environment and lifestyle to the police personnel in order to increase their productivity.

“I believe that working in a healthy environment and leading a healthy life play important role in increasing productivity of a person. We would ensure better living and working environment for our men,” said Rao.

He said that any complaint against policemen will be taken seriously and immediate actions will be taken. A dedicated platform will be set up only for grievances against police personnel, he added. “Our focus will be on providing safety to children, women and senior citizens, and also people who are staying alone,” he said.

The DGP said that expediting prosecution will also be among the priorities of the department. “We will measure the quantum of our shortcomings and work on them,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dgp-mv-rao-takes-charge--assures-people-centric-work.html

130,18-3-20,Coronavirus scare to force sombre celebration,"With the Yogi Adityanath government set to complete three years in office on Thursday, the cornavirus threat has forced the government to shelve the razzmatazz and settle for a sombre celebration.

A senior government official told The Pioneer on Tuesday that all official functions have been put on hold owing to government directives on not organising any social functions.

Yogi Adityanath took the oath of office on March 19, 2017. Eyebrows were raised as the parliamentarian, Mahant from Gorakhnath Mutt clad in saffron, was sworn in as Chief Minister of this politically sensitive state. But three years down the line, Yogi has proved his doubters wrong.

Not only did he streamline government functioning, he also made bureaucrats slog. Meetings were held to remove cobweb of indecisions so that benefits of government schemes could reach the masses. All sectors moved ahead in unision. Be it crime control, education, health, agriculture et al, projects were thrashed out and budgets were sanctioned for speedy implementation.

“I want implementation of projects of Central and state governments. Effective implementation of schemes will ensure that benefits reached identified sections effectively transparently,” Yogi said during one of his meetings with bureaucrats recently.

The feather in the cap for the Yogi government was the successful implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana under which three crore houses have been constructed for the deprived and poor people in rural areas and more than 30 lakh houses in urban areas.

Under Saubhagya scheme, Uttar Pradesh ranks first in the country by providing free power connection to more than 1.24 crore households. Under Ujala scheme, 2.60 crore LED bulbs have been distributed. The last three years have seen improvement in terms of crime control. Aiming to better law and order, police commissionerate system was implemented in Lucknow and Noida.

“The biggest achievement for UP was that the Punjab and Haryana High Court made special mention of better law and order in Uttar Pradesh during one of its observations,” said Shalabh Mani Tripathi, media advisor to the Chief Minister.

The result of ‘zero tolerance policy’ on law and order was that organised crime plummeted in 2019 as compared to 2016. All major festivals, religious processions, fairs were organised successfully.

“A provision of Rs 20 crore was made for setting up Uttar Pradesh Police Forensic University. Besides, 75 anti-power theft police stations, four women police stations, and four economic offences police stations were also set up to control crime,” Tripathi said.

Government’s achievements in irrigation sector surprised many. The state government completed eight projects, including Baan Sagar, Pahari Dam, Patharai Dam, Jamrar Dam, Maudha Dam, Pahuj Dam, Lahchura Dam, and Gunta Dam, which had been pending for 46 years. With the completion of these projects, irrigation capacity was increased to 2.16 lakh hectares.

Through single-window system ‘Nivesh Mitra’, aimed at facilitating setting up of industries in the state, 70 services of 20 departments were being made available online to investors. Government issued 97,849 NOCs to entrepreneurs through the ‘Nivesh Mitra’ portal.

The state government implemented the new Industrial Policy and made 21 new investment-friendly policies. MoUs worth Rs 4.68 lakh were signed for investment in Investors Summit in Lucknow in February 2018. Through the first and second ground-breaking ceremonies, 371 projects with investments of Rs 2 lakh crore were implemented and about 5 lakh people were employed.

UP will be boosted with the foundation of Defence Industrial Manufacturing Corridor in Bundelkhand. This corridor, to be built with an investment of 50 thousand crore rupees, will create employment of 5 lakh people.

The government realised what entrepreneurs needed and hence it started spreading network of quality roads across the state and repairing the old ones. Power supply was improved and now quality electricity is available across the state.

To boost industrial development of eastern Uttar Pradesh (Purvanchal), a 341-km-long Purvanchal Expressway is under construction from the state’s financial resources. A decision was taken to construct a 91-km-long Gorakhpur Link Expressway to link Gorakhpur with Purvanchal Expressway.

Similarly, construction of 296-km-long Bundelkhand Expressway is also on the anvil. Another Ganga Expressway is on the cards to link west UP (Meerut) with eastern part of the state (Prayagraj). This expressway will pass through Meerut, Amroha, Bulandshahr, Badaun, Shahjahanpur, Farrukhabad, Hardoi, Kannauj, Unnao, Rae Bareli, Pratapgarh and Prayagraj districts.

The high point of Yogi’s three-year rule has been the way he fulfilled promises made by the BHP to people. A record purchase of 52.92 lakh metric tonnes of wheat was made from 11,27,195 farmers under price support and online payment of Rs 9231.99 crore was made within 72 hours.

UP is the first state where maximum number of farmers (approximately 28 lakh) benefited from Prime Minister Kisan Samman Yojana. Besides, many closed and sick sugar mills were revived and in one year, the government carried out record purchase of sugar cane.

These achievements ended in national awards as UP Government bagged 12 for the first time for successful execution of schemes implemented by Union Ministry of Rural Development.

From its second year, the government started marching on the path of progress. “We are working in a transparent manner. We have given appointment in state sector to over 2.50 lakh people and after industrial units start operation, employment to 35 lakh people will be given,” the Chief Minister recently said at a private programme.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/coronavirus-scare-to--force-sombre-celebration.html

133,18-3-20,"Minor girl gangraped, police in denial","In a bizarre case, a minor girl was gangraped by four youths in Badaun but instead of registering a case, the police tried to thrash out a compromise and also took money from the accused. When contacted by media, the local police denied any such incident.

As per reports, Rekha (name changed) of Faizganj Behta in Badaun went to collect fodder for cattle last Wednesday. On the way to the field, four of her young neighbours dragged her to a secluded place and gang-raped her. When the victim passed out, they fled the scene.

On the intervention of a local leader, the police called the girl and the perpetrators at the police station on Sunday, but instead of initiating action, they asked the girl to settle for a compromise. The cops allegedly took Rs 20,000 from the accused and let them off while the girl was asked to go home and forget everything.

When contacted by local mediapersons and informed about the conduct of the cops, SHO of Faizganj, Behta, Chetram Verma denied any such incident being reported in his jurisdiction.

We are the supply chain as at any condition, we need to transport the essential which are require for survival, instance - oil and coal, there are many countries in the South hemisphere which are reliable on oil to produce electricity.. but, in this difficult times when no one wants to see us at harbor, it is difficult for us also to sustain in blue waters for long,” said a third officer deputed on the merchant ship.

Adding insight to sailor's tough time, another sailor said that we are receiving advisories in every hour and being guided by seniors what to do in hard times , however Corona pain is more hitting psychologically than affecting our physical health… staying away from families and dedicated to deliver the supply in time , sea shore companies are not providing us the quarantine suits even..everything is not wine,” he added.

The Assembly on Tuesday passed the Karnataka Lokayukta (Amendment) Bill, 2020, to further amend the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984 to enable the organisation to function more effectively.

As the Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister JC Madhuswamy moved the Karnataka Lokayukta (Amendment) Bill, 2020 for the consideration of the House, senior Congress legislator and former Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar questioned the effectiveness of Lokayukta.

Pointing out that earlier there was state vigilance commission which was replaced by Lokayukta during Ramakrishna Hegde’s tenure as Chief Minister, he asked, “is there any use because of Lokayukta? is there any qualitative change? the purpose for which this institution was created, has it served the purpose?”

He asked as to what was the “net result”, after Lokayukta took up several cases of corruption, and also wanted to know was there any value based change.

“A few people have refused to file their assets and liabilities before Lokayukta, which is mandatory for public servants.

Is it to rehabilitate someone?” he asked, as he appealed to the government to go in for a drastic law to achieve the intended objectives, which the whole country should appreciate.

Further claiming that Lokayukta as such has become a “toothless body”, Ramesh Kumar said the Lokayukta as an individual is an efficient man, but law should enable him.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/k---taka-passes-amendment-to-lokayukta-act.html
137,18-3-20,RS polls: LF nominee defeats TMC man on technical ground,"Much to the relief of Congress backed Left Front Rajya Sabha candidate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya the Election Commission on Tuesday cancelled the nomination of Dinesh Bajaj an Independent nominee backed by the Trinamool Congress on technical grounds.

Bajaj a former TMC MLA had filed his nomination for the Rajya Sabha elections barely a minute before the closure of the deadline.

With the cancellation Bajaj’s nomination only five candidates remain in the fray for five seats indicating that Bengal will see no contest in the elections for the Upper House. The other four candidates are former TMC MPs Dinesh Trivedi, Subroto Bakshi, Mausam Benazir Noor, and Arpita Ghosh. All but Bakshi had suffered a defeat at the hands of the BJP candidates in the May 2019 parliamentary elections.

A much relieved Bhattacharya who had last time suffered a fate almost similar to that of Bajaj later said “a conspiracy being hatched by the TMC and the BJP to defeat democratic forces has finally been defeated on technical grounds … The BJP and TMC had conspired to field a common candidate in the last moment so as to ensure cross-voting by pumping in ill-gotten money.”

Meanwhile after the State Election Commission postponed the civic poll process for the time being in view of Corona threat the State Government is reportedly planning to bring an ordinance to appoint an administrator for the Kolkata Municipal Corporation

Senior State Minister and Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim on Tuesday said that the Government has no choice but to get the polls conducted in the month April which seems unlikely due to Corona threat or bring an ordinance appointing an administrator for the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC).

Much to the chagrin of the opposition BJP the Mayor said unlike the Bengal Municipal Act or Howrah Municipal Corporation Act there is no provisions to appoint an administrator for the KMC. “In that case an ordinance will have to be brought to that effect if at all no election can be conducted in April,” he said.

Reacting to Hakim’s statements senior State BJP leader Sayantan Basu said the TMC was trying to evade polls and avoid a sure defeat.

“They know that their defeat is certain and so they are trying to bring an ordinance for Kolkata. We know that there is a Corona threat. But they can wait till the month of May when the polls can be conducted. The present KMC board has its term till May… They are trying to hide behind Corona virus to escape the polls,” he said.

Elsewhere the State Government took extraordinary measures to check Corona proliferation by shutting down all the cinema halls and even shootings at Tollygunge film city for the next two weeks or so.

Apart from this all the historical monuments like Hazarduari, Coochbehar House etc were closed for the public even as about 6,300 suspected people were forced into home isolation.

The Corona scare took its toll on transport business too with most thoroughfares wearing a near-deserted look. Senior officials at Kolkata Metro Railway said a drop in ticket sale by at least 1.5 lakh per day on an average.

Thinking out of the box in creating awareness on containing and safeguarding against the disease, the district administration in Wayanad, a major tourist centre, on Tuesday released pamphlets on the do’s and don’ts on the virus in different languages including foreign languages.

Pamphlets are ready in three foreign languages— French, Spanish and German and six Indian languages including Bengali, Assamese, Telugu, Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam, official sources here said.

Pamphlets in other Indian languages are also ready for distribution targeting north Indian labourers, they said.

District collector Adeela Abdulla said the initiative would go a long way in properly educating and guiding people of different regions to understand and get guided accordingly to not only prevent the spread but to take care ofthemselves.

146,18-3-20,20 more Cong MLAs ready to jump ship: Rebel MLAs,"Rebel Congress MLAs from political crisis-hit Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday claimed 20 more MLAs from that party want to join them and they were thinking of joining BJP in the days to come.

Speaking to reporters for the first time after arriving in Bengaluru and sending in their resignations, the 22 MLAs said they were ready to face any consequences.

“Jyotiraditya Scindia is our leader; we have been doing politics with him for years, most of us are in politics because of him...We are still thinking regarding joining BJP. If we get protection from central police, we will go to Madhya Pradesh and

think about it,” a woman MLA said.

The legislators claimed 20 more MLAs are with them, but have been kept in captivity. If they too were with the rebels, Congress would have clearly broken and no law could have been enforced on the group.

The rebel MLAs said they are ready for any consequences and were confident that people of their constituencies are with them.

In a massive setback for the Congress, its prominent youth leader Jyotiradtya Scindia quit the party and in a coordinated rebellion last week 22 MLAs loyal to him resigned in Madhya Pradesh, pushing the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse.

Scindia joined the BJP on March 11.

“We were quiet when our leader Jyotiraditya Scindia was not made Chief Minister. Kamal Nath, who became CM, did not give any funds to our constituencies, while clearances were given for Chhindwara (constituency represented by Nath) at almost every cabinet meeting”, a rebel MLA said.

Another MLA said Nath had no time to meet them and hear their grievances.

“When there is no development in our constituency, what is the use?”

Several MLAs also alleged that seniority and capability were not considered in forming of Ministry after the elections.

They said they even met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in this regard, but nothing came of it. Rejecting claims by Congress leaders that they were held hostage here, the MLAs clarified that they had come to the city voluntarily.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/20-more-cong-mlas-ready-to-jump-ship--rebel-mlas.html
147,18-3-20,"My call for change will turn a political tsunami, says Rajini","Rajinikanth is here to stay and leaders of other political parties better start ways and means to check his caravan as it begins its journey across Tamil Nadu soon. This was stated by the film actor himself during a private function late Monday at Chennai.

“There has been a grounds well of public support to my announcement about the pre-conditions for launching the political outfit. As we approach the 2021 Assembly Election in Tamil Nadu, this could develop into a political tsunami in my favor,” said Rajinikanth.

Last Wednesday saw Rajinikanth addressing the media in Chennai after a brief interaction with the district-level office bearers of Rajini Makkal Manram. Though he did not take any questions from the media, he stated that there was a political vacuum in the State and people wanted a change. His declaration that he would not be the chief ministerial candidate has gone down well with Tamil nationalist film makers like Bharati Raja and Vadivelu, another super star who immediately announced their support to Rajinikanth.

Since Rajinikanth is not a natural Tamilian, there are reservations among Tamil chauvinist movie makers and artists against his political dreams. But his decision not to accept the chief ministership of the State and announcement that he would be a watch dog of the Government has been widely welcomed.

But the Muslim community in the State is not humored by the actor’s decision to venture out into the terrain of politics. “Rajinikanth is being deployed by the RSS-led sangh Parivar to mislead people in Tamil Nadu. All his plans, including two separate persons heading the party and the government resemble the RSS style. The Narendra Modi-Amit Shah experiment at the Centre is being extended to Tamil Nadu,” said P Abdul Rahman, vice president, Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamaath.

Rahman said in a release that the Sangh Parivar’s efforts to enter Tamil Nadu met with a failure as the people could see through their “evil intentions”. “The RSS has selected Rajinikanth to implement their Hindutwa politics in the State and this would not work here,” he said. The TNTJ leader pointed out that the actor was fully behind the RSS in the CAA issue and that itself gave out his true colours.

But an interesting reaction came from K Manickavasagam, a decorated police officer from Thanjavur. “The exemplary and extraordinary political ideas are a preview to your outstanding brand of politics for providing a corruption-free, dynasty-free and service oriented government for the people of Tamil Nadu is a welcome move,” said Manickavasagam in a letter to Rajinikanth. The super star had declared last Wednesday that there would not be any professional politicians in the system envisaged by him and no one should join him with the aim of making money or occupying positions of power.

Manickavasagam, who was honored with the Chief Minister’s Gallantry Medal has also presented Rajinikanth with a copy of his service story, which the former said was written with a heavy heart. “This recording is a reflection of the corrupt and rotten political system of nowadays. I hope this book will come handy for him to usher in an unpolluted and uncorrupted fresh democratic politics,” Manickavasagam told this newspaper.

Even as mainstream political leaders are maintaining silence over the actor’s entry into politics, Tamil Nadu’s leading commentator S Gurumurthy is confident that Rajinikanth is cut out for the job. “There is space for him in Tamil Nadu politics and he is going to make the much delayed change,” said Gurumurthy.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/my-call-for-change-will-turn-a-political-tsunami--says-rajini.html

150,18-3-20,SC grants permanent commission to women in Navy,"In a major judgment to provide equal opportunities in the armed forces, the Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the Navy to grant permanent commission to women officers in three months and said they can sail as efficiently as male officers. This opens the door for women officers to be deployed on warships. The judgment comes nearly a month after the apex court granted permanent commission to women in the Army.

Maintaining that women and men officers should be treated equally, the a Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud on Tuesday also said there cannot be “101 excuses” for not granting gender equality in the armed forces and a level playing field is needed. Denying permanent commission to women officers who have served the nation would result in a serious miscarriage of justice, it said.

The Bench, also comprising Justice Ajay Rastogi, rejected the Centre’s stand that sea sailing duties cannot be granted to SSC (Short Service Commission) women officers in the Navy because its vessels do not have washrooms for them.

Such arguments, the court said, are contrary to the Centre’s policy of 1991 and 1998 which lifted the statutory bar on the induction of women officers in the Navy.

The Bench quashed the prospective effect of the policy barring women officers inducted before 2008 from being granted permanent commission in the Navy. It also granted pension benefits to women officers who have retired and were not granted permanent commission.

It said there cannot be gender discrimination in granting permanent commission to women officers in the Navy after the statutory bar was lifted by the Centre to allow entry of women.

“Once statutory bar was lifted to allow entry of women officers then male and female officers are to be treated equally in granting permanent commission,” the court said. It also said there is enough documentary evidence to suggest women officers in the Navy have brought accolades to the force.

The first naval woman pilot - Sub-Lieutenant Shivangi - joined the operational duties at the Kochi naval base on December 2 last year. She has been flying the Dornier surveillance aircraft of the Indian Navy.

151,18-3-20,Not allowing MPs to ask question on regional language issues insult: RaGa,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday made his attack against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla more direct and fiercer alleging with no discussion happening the lower house had become a “loudspeaker” of the Government. He said not only him but even the Tamil Nadu MPs were disallowed from speaking on their mother language issues.

The former Congress chief also continued attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the economic situation in the country, saying the PM should get his head “out of the sand” to deal with the problem facing the country. Rahul said India should be preparing itself not just to fight the coronavirus but also for the economic devastation that would affect crores of people.

Rahul said it was an “insult” to the people of Tamil Nadu that MPs were not allowed to ask questions on the regional language issue, and alleged that with no discussion happening, the Lok Sabha had become a “loudspeaker” of the Government.

Rahul’s remarks came after Opposition members, including from the DMK, the Congress and the NCP, walked out of the Lok Sabha claiming they were not allowed to ask a supplementary question related to official language during the Question Hour.

Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Rahul said he was not allowed to ask a supplementary on Monday on a question on the 50 biggest wilful defaulters and the same happened to Opposition MPs on a question on the Tamil language.

Rahul alleged that the Speaker took away the rights of the people of Tamil Nadu by not allowing the supplementary question on their language.

“Now it is ok for the Speaker to hurt me, I understand he doesn’t want me to speak. But today the entire Tamil people wanted to ask a supplementary about the Tamil language. This is not about one person, this is not about Rahul Gandhi, this is about the people of Tamil Nadu and their language and even they were not allowed to ask that question, this is absolutely an insult to the people of Tamil Nadu,” he said.

Asked if he believes the Lok Sabha speaker is acting in a partisan manner, Rahul Gandhi said, “This is a House that belongs to all states, all languages. There should be a discussion here, but no discussion is happening these days. Nobody can ask a question.” “There is one-way traffic and it (Lok Sabha) has become a loudspeaker,” he said.

Later, in a tweet, Rahul said the people of Tamil Nadu were “disrespected” when the Speaker refused to allow a supplementary question on the Tamil language.

On the state of economy and COVID 19, he said Indian economy will be devastated and it is like a tsunami is coming Narrating an incident to highlight the gravity of the economic situation, he said that before the tsunami came, water receded off the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and when fishermen went to sea, the tsunami struck.

“So the water is going to come. I have been warning the government that a massive (economic) tsunami is coming and they are fooling about, they are not clear about what to do. India should be preparing itself not just for COVID-19 virus but for the economic devastation that is coming,” he said.

“I am saying it again and again, nobody is listening to me. I am sorry to say, our people are going to go through unimaginable pain in the next six months,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/not-allowing-mps-to-ask-question-on-regional-language-issues-insult--raga.html

The Speaker’s comments in the House came a day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said that he was not allowed supplementary to a question on the willful defaulting banks in the country.

The Opposition members who were supported by Rahul sought to ask supplementary when Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai was replying to a question related to official language. Rai was replying to a question as what was being done to make Hindi a national language.

As the Speaker took up the next question during the Question Hour, DMK leader T R Baalu vociferously protested that they should be allowed to ask supplementary questions.

Amid the din, Congress leader Rahul intervened by standing up and saying that it was an issue at the heart of the people of Tamil Nadu and that supplementaries should be allowed.

He was referring to issues regarding official language.

With the Speaker continuing with the next question, members from various Opposition parties, including DMK, Congress and NCP walked out from the House.

Some Congress leaders were also seen talking to TMC leader Sudip Bandhoypadhya but the party’s members remained in their seats.

Speaker had, at the beginning, sought members to ask short questions so that maximum questions could be answered by the ministers. He has also been asking ministers to reply in brief.

Seeking dismissal of the pleas, it said Indian secularism is ""not irreligious"", rather it takes cognisance of all religions and promotes comity and brotherhood.

The affidavit, filed by B C Joshi, Director in the Ministry of Home Affairs, said the CAA does not confer any arbitrary and unguided powers on the executive as the citizenship to the persecuted minorities of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh would be granted in a manner as specified under the law governing grant of citizenship.

""CAA does not impinge upon any existing right that may have existed prior to the enactment of the amendment and further, in no manner whatsoever, seeks to affect the legal, democratic or secular rights of any of the Indian citizens. The existing regime for obtaining citizenship of India by foreigners of any country is untouched by the CAA and remains the same,"" it said.

162,18-3-20,"Create second line of finger spinners for Test team, urge former India spinners","Indian cricket has celebrated the emergence of a potent fast bowling unit but it is high time that the establishment focuses on producing quality Test spinners, especially off-break bowlers, feel former players.

Ravichandran Ashwin (365 wickets in 71 Tests) has been an impact bowler in home conditions but the current team management hasn’t exactly put complete faith in Tamil Nadu tweaker’s abilities in overseas conditions.

While former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh feels that seasoned domestic performers like Akshay Wakhare (34 years) and Jalaj Saxena (33 years) should be given a break, another veteran Laxman Sivaramakrishnan is of the opinion that a younger pool needs to be created as Ashwin still has “good three years of Test cricket left in him”.

“Ashwin is a very hard-working bowler and he has not taken his place for granted. He still has three good years left and it’s time now that we find the next crop of young spinners which is ready to take over when time comes,” Sivaramakrishnan said.

But Harbhajan has a different idea.

“Jalaj Saxena and Akshay Wakhare have performed year after year at the domestic level, at times on flat tracks. I have seen Akshay closely at the Mumbai Indians nets. Age for me is just a number. I don’t believe these two can’t be tried,"" the ‘Turbanator’ said.

But why have we not produced any second line of off-spinners in these years?

“I haven’t seen a good off-spinner at the Ranji level. That’s because of bad captaincy at the Ranji Trophy level. If an off-spinner gets hit by a right-hander, captains take him off and that hits his confidence. Harbhajan Singh became a great bowler because the captain was Sourav Ganguly, who gave him encouragement,” said Sivaramakrishnan, the hero of 1985 Benson & Hedges Cup.

Siva does have sympathy for Saxena though.

“Jalaj’s is a classic case of his career completely coinciding with Ashwin’s best years. But right now we can’t look at players who are 33 or 34 years. Because by the time another three years go by, the fitness levels might be an issue.”

What about Karnataka’s Krishnappa Gowtham?

“He is good but I don’t think good enough for Test cricket,” was Siva’s honest assessment.

“We need a new set of good spinners (all types) at the India A level, who should be ready in next three years. Rahul Chahar is very young but again, he is more of a white-ball bowler. Shahbaz Nadeem is 30 plus and Yuzvendra Chahal is in his late 20s,” he added with a note of caution.

Another former Test off-spinner Rajesh Chauhan believes that Ashwin’s problem is not knowing at times what is his wicket-taking delivery.

“Ashwin is a class bowler but with so much variations, he at times doesn’t know what is his wicket-taking delivery. About Jalaj, I don’t think he is a specialist off-spinner. He is more of an all-rounder.”

Former wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta felt that various state teams, on the junior cricket set-up, do not put emphasis on creating a talent pool.

“We had a phase where we wanted only wrist spinners at the highest level. So at the junior level (U-16 & U-19), boys started feeling what’s the use of being an off-spinner. But I agree with Harbhajan that Wakhare or Jalaj could be tried in future.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/create-second-line-of-finger-spinners-for-test-team--urge-former-india-spinners.html

Replying to a discussion on the working of the Ministry of Railways, Goyal announced an investment of Rs 50 lakh crore in the national transporter over the next 12 years.

""I want to make it crystal clear that there is no plan or proposal to privatise Indian Railways, it will not happen. Indian Railways belongs to the people of this country, it will remain so,"" Goyal said.

Keeping in mind development of the railways, the government may, however, bring in a few services under private sector in order to provide better services to the passengers, he added.

Participating in the discussion, several Rajya Sabha members raised concerns over the poor financial health of the railways, decline in job opportunities and delay in execution of major projects, besides privatisation of the national transporter. Goyal said the government was committed to making Indian Railways world class in every aspect.

""In the next 12 years we are going to invest Rs 50 lakh crore in the Indian Railways. We will do it in public private partnership. We will also give the chance to the people of this country to be part of this process,"" he added.

The minister, however, added it was ""not a bad practice"".

172,18-3-20,Opp members flay Govt move to decriminalise corporate offenses,"As a Bill to amend the Companies Act 2013 and decriminalise various offences under it was introduced in Lok Sabha on Tuesday Opposition members of various parties said that the Government was decriminalising corporate offences on the pretext of ‘ease of doing business’ and not looking after the interest of common investors while protecting big businessmen by reducing penalties.

Bhartruhari Mahtab (BJD) said the Government was giving banks a long rope in the “guise” of ease of doing business and “reducing penalties” when “banks are failing”. This , he said, would encourage criminals. Mahtab said the Act has been amended repeatedly which reflect an “adhoc approach” of the Government.

Questioning the timing of introduction of the Bill, the BJD MP asked, “Is this an opportune time to introduce the Bill when a large private bank has collapsed?”

On March 5, the Reserve Bank superseded the board of Yes Bank in the wake of deepening crisis, mainly due to huge bad loans and a moratorium has been imposed. Under a revival plan, SBI and some private banks have made investments in Yes Bank.

Many companies are folding up because of the activities of promoters, Mahtab said.

Sauguta Roy (TMC) said the Government was influenced by industry in amending the companies act. “Today (former) CEO of Yes Bank is in Enforcement Directorate custody...The Government is seeking to decriminalise certain regulations in the name of ease of doing business,” Roy said.

Yes Bank co-founder and former CEO Rana Kapoor is in ED custody. Backing TMC and BJD members, Congress leader of the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the Government can be “identified as by the corpoates... for the corporates”.

He claimed that the Government is diluting Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) norms to help the corporate sector.

Manish Tewari (Congress) said Government was seen to be with defaulters rather than with the small investors . He also said that people were “losing confidence in banking sector.”

173,18-3-20,Moody’s lowers India’s GDP growth forecast,"Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday lowered India’s GDP growth forecast for 2020 calendar year to 5.3 per cent, on coronavirus implications on the economy. Moody’s had in February projected a 5.4 per cent real GDP growth for India in 2020. This too was a downgrade from 6.6 per cent earlier forecast. The 5.3 per cent real GDP growth forecast for 2020 compares to 5.3 per cent growth estimate for 2019 and 7.4 per cent achieved in 2018.

Stating that there was significant economic fallout from more rapid and wider spread of the coronavirus, the rating agency on Tuesday said dampening of domestic consumption demand in affected countries exacerbates disruptions to supply chains and cross-border trade of goods and services.

“The longer the disruptions last, the greater the risk of global recession becomes,” it said. Moody’s forecast a 5.8 per cent growth rate for India in 2021. “A number of governments and central banks have announced countervailing measures, including fiscal stimulus packages, policy rate cuts and regulatory forbearance; however, the effectiveness of policy easing will be blunted by measures to contain the outbreak, and policy space is constrained for some sovereigns,” it said. Also, tighter funding conditions and exchange rate depreciation could stress sovereigns with high foreign currency exposure, heavy reliance on external market funding or low foreign currency reserve coverage, it said.

Moody’s said oil price shock adds to growth and fiscal pressures for exposed sovereigns. “A period of lower oil prices will further weigh on the economic and fiscal fundamentals of oil exporters, while mitigating the trade shock for importers.”

Meanwhile, Moody’s Investors Service has said that global spread of new coronavirus (Covid-19) will significantly slow economic growth, which will in turn amplify its financial impact on several key free movement-driven sectors. “Sectors reliant on trade and the free movement of people are most exposed, such as passenger airlines, shipping, and lodging and leisure, which includes cruise lines and restaurants,” Vice President - Senior Credit Officer - Benjamin Nelson at Moody’s said in a statement. Global automakers are also under great pressure because of their reliance on international supply chains, while gaming and non-food retail in certain regions are also exposed to supply chain disruptions, and the inevitable decline in foot traffic. “Companies’ ability to withstand the effects of the virus will depend on its duration, and we caution that as events unfold very rapidly on a daily basis, our assessment of exposure will change over time,” another Vice President - Senior Credit Officer - at Moody’s Richard Morawetz said. Moody’s assessment is based on its baseline scenario, which assumes a normalisation of economic activity in the second half of the year, and the ability of some companies to withstand the effects of the virus will depend on its duration.

The agency’s downside scenario factors in a jump in cases and public fear that the virus will not be contained in the first half of 2020, leading to extensive and prolonged travel restrictions and quarantines, along with a prolonged slump in commodity prices. The number of deaths around the world linked to Covid-19 has topped 7,000, after Italy announced a new surge in fatalities, with over 1,75,000 infections recorded globally so far.

Likewise, the broader NSE Nifty slumped 230.35 points or 2.50 per cent to finish at 8,967.05. Nifty has ended below the key 9,000-level after March 2017.

Global markets reeled after the Wall Street suffered its worst crash since the ‘Black Monday’ in October 1987, with the US Fed’s emergency rate cut failing to lift investor sentiment amid the drumbeat of negative news surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic. Unabated foreign fund outflows and a weak rupee further weighed on domestic bourses, traders said.

ICICI Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack, tumbling 8.95 per cent, followed by IndusInd Bank (8.89 per cent), Bajaj Finance (6.26 per cent), HDFC (4.74 per cent), Infosys (4.68 per cent) and Kotak Bank (4.53 per cent). On the other hand, HUL spurted 3.49 per cent, Hero MotoCorp 3.09 per cent, Asian Paints 3.05 per cent, PowerGrid 2.53 per cent and Maruti 2.12 per cent.

According to traders, value-buying lifted benchmarks during the first half of the session, but the gains could not be sustained as markets succumbed to coronavirus-led fears of an impending recession. “After trading in the positive for the majority of the day, the indices turned red during the last hour of trading, with selling mainly seen in financials. European markets and Dow futures added to the negativity. “Covid-19 showed no signs of abatement and with central banks’ monetary policy actions having limited impact, calls were out for more actions to contain the spread of the virus,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. BSE bankex, finance, telecom, teck, IT and realty indices gained up to 4.46 per cent, while FMCG ended in the green. Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices ended up to 2.27 per cent lower.

The dollar bounced back from heavy losses against the euro on Monday, while oil prices also recovered.

European stock markets surged around five percent in early deals Tuesday before either limiting or erasing all the gains.

""As has been the case every time the European markets have tried to rebound, it is not going to be smooth sailing,"" noted Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex trading group.

Wall Street indices collapsed Monday in their worst day since 1987, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq dropping about 12 percent and the Dow sinking nearly 13 percent. US futures rallied Tuesday.

In a move meant to help tame the massive volatility in the markets caused by the coronavirus outbreak, the French bourse regulator on Tuesday banned short-selling in 92 stocks for the day.

""Taking into account the significant losses in recent days on the financial markets, the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) has decided to take an urgent step,"" it said in a statement.

The ban order covers mostly bank and financial stocks.

Investors use short-selling to bet the market will fall, putting tremendous downward pressure on prices at a time when buying interest is virtually non-existent.

While governments and central banks attempt to soothe markets with massive stimulus pledges and interest rate cuts, more countries are going into lockdown to prevent the outbreak's spread — bringing the world economy juddering to a halt.

There is a broad consensus that the disease, which has wiped trillions off market valuations, will cause a global recession, with the airline industry among the first in the firing line, leading company heads to plead for billions of dollars in state help to prevent them going under.

178,18-3-20,"FADA approaches SC seeking extension of sale, registration of BS-IV vehicles till May end","Automobile dealers' body FADA on Tuesday said it has filed an application with the Supreme Court seeking extension of sale and registration of BS-IV vehicles till May 31, 2020 — an extension of two months from March-end deadline to clear the stock of such models.

The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) on behalf of its members has once again approached the Supreme Court, and has filed an interlocutory application along with an application seeking modification in writ petition dated October 24, 2018.

In the petition, in the matter of M C Mehta versus Union of India and others, the apex court had directed that no motor vehicle conforming to emission standard BS-IV shall be sold or registered in the entire country with effect from April 1, 2020.

""We have submitted an application with the Supreme Court for extension of registration process of BS-IV vehicles till May 31, 2020. We are now seeking an urgent hearing on the matter,"" FADA President Ashish Harsharaj Kale told PTI. The two-wheeler BS-IV inventory at dealerships across the country stood at around 8.35 lakh units valued at around Rs 4,600 crore, he added.

""The situation in the passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle segments is much better as compared to two-wheelers,"" Kale said. FADA had filed an application earlier as well which was rejected by the apex court on February 14 this year.

""Post our initial application, necessitated due to huge unsold BS-IV inventory and slowing sales, getting rejected by the apex court on February 14, 2020, there has been a drastic change in circumstances in conducting business as usual,"" Kale said.

The spread of coronavirus has led to a drastic drop in sales and customer walk-ins have reduced to a trickle, he added.

""As caution sets in due to fear of spreading of the virus, counter sales has fallen by 60-70 per cent across auto dealerships in these past few days,"" Kale said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fada-approaches-sc-seeking-extension-of-sale--registration-of-bs-iv-vehicles-till-may-end.html
179,18-3-20,Will not sell any share in Yes Bank for next 3 yrs: SBI,"State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Tuesday said that the state-run bank will not sell any of its shares in the crisis-hit Yes Bank in the next three years. The SBI has been allotted 605 crore shares in Yes Bank for an investment of Rs 6,050 crore and would be the largest shareholder in the restructured bank with a stake of 49 per cent.

Its statement gains significance as the reconstruction plan for Yes Bank said that the largest public sector bank will have to hold at least 26 per cent stake for the next three years. Concerns of a possible profiteering by the investing banks have arisen as the prevailing share price of Yes Bank is nearly six times the price at which the domestic banks have subscribed to its shares. Yes Bank shares closed at Rs 58.65 a piece on BSE on Tuesday.

Rajnish Kumar on Tuesday said that although he cannot talk about other banks, regarding SBI, ""not even a single share will be sold in three years"".

Other private sector banks who have put in a total of Rs 3,950 crore so far, would have to hold at least 75 per cent of their investment for a three year period under the terms of restructuring scheme.

Even if such entities want to sell the 25 per cent of their investment now, which they are free to execute under the scheme, they would end up not only recovering their entire investment but also making windfall gains.

Among the private players, ICICI Bank and Housing Development Finance Corporation committed Rs 1,000 crore each. Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank committed to invest Rs 600 crore and Rs 500 crore, respectively. Both Federal Bank and Bandhan Bank have been allotted shares for Rs 300 crore each as per their commitment and IDFC First Bank has been issued equity shares in the crisis-ridden bank.

Rajnish Kumar said that it was decided that a two-stage funding should be carried out for Yes Bank as trying to raise the total required capital in one go would have extended the moratorium on the private sector lender.

""Enough money was available, but in the first stage (it was decided) let it be within Indian domestic bankers. Lot of foreign investors had interest... but that would mean longer moratorium,"" he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/will-not-sell-any-share-in-yes-bank-for-next-3-yrs--sbi.html
180,18-3-20,Iran warns virus could kill ‘millions’ in Islamic Republic,"Iran issued its most dire warning yet on Tuesday about the outbreak of the new coronavirus ravaging the country, suggesting “millions” could die in the Islamic Republic if the public keeps travelling and ignoring health guidance.

A state television journalist who also is a medical doctor gave the warning only hours after hard-line Shiite faithful the previous night pushed their way into the courtyards of two major shrines that had just been closed over fears of the virus.

Meanwhile, Iran’s supreme leader issued a religious ruling prohibiting “unnecessary” travel in the country.

Roughly nine out of 10 of the over 18,000 cases of the new virus confirmed across the Middle East come from Iran, where authorities denied for days the risk the outbreak posed. Officials have now implemented new checks for people trying to leave major cities ahead of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, on Friday, but have hesitated to quarantine the areas.

That’s even as the death toll in Iran saw another 13 per cent increase on Tuesday. Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said the virus had killed 135 more people to raise the total to 988 amid over 16,000 cases.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran-warns-virus-could-kill----millions----in-islamic-republic.html

184,18-3-20,Biden wins Washington primary,"Joe Biden has won the Democratic primary in Washington state, US media have projected, in another boost for the frontrunner who is hoping to build an insurmountable lead over rival Bernie Sanders.

After most of the votes were counted on Monday night, NBC and the New York Times called the result — a narrow victory for Biden, who is up against Sanders for the chance to challenge President Donald Trump in November.

They said that former vice president Biden had won 37.9 percent of the vote, with the leftist Sanders close behind with 36.4 percent.

The result came as millions of Americans were due to troop to polling stations in three more states on Tuesday, with anxiety running high over the fast-spreading coronavirus that has killed more than 80 people in the US so far.

As Arizona, Florida, and Illinois prepare for the primaries, there was confusion over whether polling stations will be safe during the pandemic.

Voting has been postponed in Ohio, where officials ordered polling stations closed, making it the latest and largest state to upend the voting schedule due to the outbreak.

Tuesday may be a make-or-break moment for Sanders, who will face mounting pressure to quit if he does not score a major upset.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/biden-wins-washington-primary.html

In a letter sent to both candidates, the last two viable contenders in the Democratic primary, the groups note that women and people of color make up the majority of the party’s voters in the last two presidential elections. “At the intersection of those communities … women of color have a unique and critical role to play in galvanizing the entire progressive coalition,” the letter reads.

Biden, a former vice president, pledged during Sunday’s Democratic debate to pick a woman as his running mate if the wins the nomination. Sanders, a Vermont senator, said he would “in all likelihood” choose a woman. Aimee Allison, founder of She The People, said the letter is “a warning to not repeat the mistake that Hillary Clinton’s campaign made in 2016” by tapping a white male as her running mate. “The warning is, if you have an all-white ticket, if you don’t put a woman of color on the ticket, some of us will come out for you, but not in the numbers you need to win the battle ground states,” Allison said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/groups-call-on-biden--sanders-to-choose-a-woman-of-color-for-vp.html
186,18-3-20,"Iraq’s PM-designate Adnan Zurfi, Shiite moderate with US ties","Adnan Zurfi, Iraq’s second premier-designate this year, is respected for focussing on public services and security but faces resistance from factions wary of his close ties with the United States.

The 54-year-old lawmaker is the ex-governor of the Shiite Muslim shrine city of Najaf, has advanced degrees in religious studies and was a long-time member of the Dawa Party which opposed ex-dictator Saddam Hussein.

After a failed 1991 uprising against Saddam, Zurfi fled to Saudi Arabia and then on to the United States, returning to Iraq after the US-led invasion in 2003.

He is an Iraqi-US dual national and his wife, five sons and two daughters still live in the United States.

Under Iraqi law, he would have to renounce his American citizenship to take up the premiership, which is yet to be confirmed by Parliament.

Zurfi was appointed Najaf governor in 2004 by the US occupation force, to take on the Mehdi Army of Shiite cleric Moqtada Sadr, which was attacking American troops.

He later managed to repair his relationship with Sadr, now a kingmaker in Iraqi politics.

Zurfi has been able to build a public profile in Iraq as a TV talk show regular, clean-shaven and with his silver-tinged hair slicked back.

Fellow MP Sarkawt Shamsaddin said Zurfi had earned respect for taking the initiative on social and economic projects and described him as “a moderate Shiite voice who is supportive of ties with the West”.

In order to win the premiership, he will have to overcome the resistance of political factions allied with Iran, Washington’s arch-rival, which is an influential force in Iraqi politics.

Zurfi’s nomination by President Barham Saleh came on a day crisis-battered Iraq faced new turmoil: a pre-dawn rocket attack on an Iraqi base hosting foreign troops, and looming curfews to slow the coronavirus pandemic.

The rocky security situation and collapsing oil prices come after months of anti-government protests and will form the main challenges for the new premier-designate.

As a relatively young newcomer in Baghdad, there are hopes he could shake up politics after months of paralysis.

“Zurfi is a new name and that’s probably more an advantage than a disadvantage,” said Sajad Jiyad, an Iraqi analyst.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iraq---s-pm-designate-adnan-zurfi--shiite-moderate-with-us-ties.html
187,18-3-20,Depositors' money safe: Yes Bank,"With normal banking services in Yes Bank to resume at 6 pm on Wednesday, the private sector bank's administrator and new investors assured all deposit holders that their savings in the bank were absolutely safe and customers would have much better experience when they resume usual interaction with the lender.

""There is no need to worry about safety of deposits in the bank. The bank has emerged stronger with the equity support of domestic banks and quick action by the RBI and the Government. So when normal banking services resume tomorrow, customers can expect to get much better experience,"" Prashant Kumar, Yes Bank administrator and the next MD and CEO of the bank's newly constituted board, told media persons at a Press conference.

Responding to questions whether there would be a flurry of withdrawals from the depositors once normal banking services resume on Wednesday, he said that Yes Bank has sufficient funding lines available with it and based on analytics and positive vibes generated by the restructuring scheme, there would not be a flurry of withdrawals.

""Even during moratorium period, only one-third of depositors withdrew their savings to the extent of Rs 50,000 while the remaining did not withdraw at all. In fact, in last four days, Yes Bank has seen more inflows than outflow,"" Kumar said.

Asked if there was a contingency plan to check withdrawal rush, he said he had no reasons to believe why that would happen but even in the event of an eventuality, the bank has sufficient funding lines available to it.

The State Bank of India (SBI), which has become the anchor investor in Yes Bank after if picked up close to 49 per cent stake in the bank, also said that it did not see nervous depositors flocking Yes Bank branches for withdrawals once normally banking services resumed. ""There are sufficient funding lines to meet any eventuality. We do not see another moratorium being put in place,"" said SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar.

188,18-3-20,Yes Bank shares rally for fourth consecutive session; zoom 50 pc,"Shares of Yes Bank continued to rally for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday, sharply rising by 50 per cent after SBI chairman said the bank was keel to to up stake to 49 per cent in the private lender.

The scrip jumped 49.95 per cent to Rs 87.95 on the BSE.

On the NSE, it zoomed 48.84 per cent to Rs 87.30.

In four days, the scrip has risen a whopping 251 per cent.

Shares of Yes Bank had jumped over 59 per cent on Tuesday also after Moody's upgraded the company's ratings.

Announcement of a restructuring plan has triggered the rally in the scrip.

State Bank chairman Rajnish Kumar on Tuesday said the country's largest lender that owns close to 43 per cent in Yes Bank now will not sell a single share before that mandated three-year lock-in period, and that he's in fact keen to approach the board for hiking the holding to 49 per cent.

Under the RBI and government-driven rescue of the fourth largest private lender, SBI was initially asked to take up to 49 per cent by investing Rs 7,250 crore into the equity capital of Yes Bank.

But as seven other lenders came on board, it could pick up only around 43 per cent or 60.50 crore shares for Rs 6,050 crore.

Explaining the rationale for the lower stake, the chairman said ""since investor interest was overwhelming, which met the current capital requirement, we chose to pick up only so much in the first round of fund raising.""

""In fact, I am keen to move my board to seek permission to increase the stake to the maximum permissible 49 per cent and that it's my commitment that SBI will not sell a single share before the three-year lock-in. This is in spite of the regulatory and government permission to pare down our equity to 26 per cent by after three years. And I don't see my board saying no to the proposal as well,"" Kumar said.

Further, the moratorium on Yes Bank would be lifted by 6 pm on March 18, as per the reconstruction scheme notified by the government on Friday.

Yes Bank CEO-designate Prashant Kumar on Tuesday said there are absolutely no worries on the liquidity front and that complete operational normalcy would be restored from 6 pm on Wednesday.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/yes-bank-shares-rally-for-fourth-consecutive-session--zoom-50-pc-2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/yes-bank-shares-rally-for-fourth-consecutive-session--zoom-50-pc.html

190,18-3-20,We are financially strong and well-capitalised: IndusInd Bank,"Private sector lender IndusInd Bank has said it is financially strong, well-capitalised and profitable, amid market rumours about the health of the lender after the Yes Bank crisis came to light.

""In the wake of the significantly higher level of market rumours and speculation around IndusInd Bank stock, we would like to reiterate that the Bank is financially strong, well-capitalised, profitable, and a growing entity with a strong governance,"" it said in a late night statement on Tuesday.

The bank's stock ended nearly 9 per cent down at Rs 604.30 on the BSE on Tuesday.

The lender said gross non-performing assets (NPAs) in December quarter 2019 stood at 2.18 per cent which was lowest among large private sector banks.

""We expect current quarter gross NPA to be pretty much in line with that of last quarter. We expect our net NPA of 1.05 per cent as at the last quarter to fall below 1 per cent, in line with our ambition to take provision cover beyond 60 per cent,"" it said in the statement.

Citing reports on relief measures to the telecom sector, IndusInd Bank said this is a significant positive step and the bank awaits further details on the matter.

The bank noted that its latest gross NPA figure as at the end of February 2020 was zero with respect to real estate developer (commercial & residential); gems and jewellery financing.

Commercial vehicle and microfinance portfolios remain steady and range-bound, it added.

""Market rumours about individual exposures doing the rounds are bloated and outlandish and nowhere near the truth. The bank makes full disclosures every quarter on its loan book profile.""

On liquidity, it said the bank maintains liquidity well above 100 per cent going up to 120 per cent on a daily basis.

The deposit business of the bank on both retail and corporate segments is steady.

""However, a couple of state government entities have made withdrawals amounting to less than 2 per cent of our total deposits. We are engaging with them to reiterate the stance of the Regulator that Government deposits in all private sector Banks is safe,"" the bank said.

The bank has been a lender in the interbank market last week and at 15.43 per cent CRAR --capital to risk weighted assets ratio -- (including 9 month profits), the bank does not need capital for 2 years.

""All our banking with other banks and counterparties is 'business as usual'. We continue to enjoy interbank lines / limits without interruption,"" said the lender.

Also, the bank promoter has sought RBI approval to increase shareholding to 26 per cent and further guidance from the regulator is awaited.

The promoter has already informed the exchange about the simultaneous release of non-disposal undertaking with the creation of a pledge in relation to 23.8 million shares of the bank.

No new borrowing was undertaken and was merely a formalisation of a three-year old arrangement. The money was originally raised to make an overseas acquisition which did not fructify - the pledge is a small fraction of promoter holding in the bank, it said.

""Various market rumours and speculation incorrectly reflect on the Bank's financial health and are totally misplaced, motivated and not based on facts,"" the lender said.

196,18-3-20,Develop business skills,"To become a successful entrepreneur, there is need for positive attitude and support structure, says DR NARENDRA SHYAMSUKHA

One of the common characteristics of successful entrepreneurs is that they launched their ventures while they were young. According to a survey done by Ernst and Young with nearly 700 entrepreneurs, more than half of them launched their companies while they were in their 20s.

The survey also found that they did not jump-start their ventures straight after finishing higher education. They had to gain experience before they could launch their venture. However, nearly a third of the people who participated in the survey said that higher education provided them with the grounding they needed for their business practice. Having an entrepreneurial component in higher education will aid in the creation of more entrepreneurs and ventures, in turn creating job opportunities.

To become a successful entrepreneur, a positive attitude and a support structure are a must. This will foster positive opportunism and greater acceptance of failure. Universities can give students useful and systematic knowledge on all aspects of running a business, and equip them with the necessary tools to prepare them for eventualities.

It goes without saying that campus life will give them plenty of opportunities to test their business ideas and get feedback on their work. They also get to analyse variables of trade in a systematic way, formulate and test hypotheses, and think about abstract concepts. If they can learn to solve problems and take creative decisions based on reliable data, they will learn how to run a business that operates with a high degree of accountability. This will teach them how to successfully manage commercial concerns in the long run.

College students are in an important transitional phase in their life. As they start to explore personal independence, their identities start to solidify. If they receive the right stimulation, it allows them to develop a higher degree of self-control and work on their vision.

Universities must include courses and facilities that teach students critical thinking and risk taking. This will help them form an identity as an entrepreneur. Observational and experiential learning must be given equal importance. In other words, the course must focus o both theory and practice.

The universities must provide facilitators who are capable of delivering content to students. This includes academics and successful entrepreneurs. The delivery methods must also be diverse to cater to the widest possible cross-section of students as possible.

Internet media, incubation support, simulations, help developing a business plan, internship opportunities, case studies, one-on-one interactions, study visits, project work, mentoring, and competition among others will help support a successful implementation of an entrepreneurship education curriculum.

Students need requisite knowledge and skill set to conduct their study with a focus on selection and recruitment. This must be accompanied with a supporting environment and motivating incentives like grants along with a grading system that allows them to conduct study in an effective way. Lecturers can aid them with progress reviews, using right teaching methods and implementing a reward system to acknowledge their participation.

For entrepreneurship education in higher education to be a success, graduates must possess certain core competencies. They need to be able to identify and evaluate business opportunities, identify and solve problems, make the right decisions at the right time, network, communicate effectively, and display out of the box thinking.

If they can tick all the above boxes, then they have demonstrated that they have the core competencies needed to kick-start their own venture. Graduates must also be capable of developing a business plan that can sustain after launch.

Apropos sustainability, the venture must be able to provide employment, make enough profits to fuel expansion, innovate consistently and effectively, develop a strong public image, and satisfy all stakeholders.

If such a structured framework can be executed successfully, we will be able to integrate it with the existing curriculum and scale it up on a national level.

197,18-3-20,"‘In order to succeed, failure is important’","Losing or making mistakes is not a sign of weakness, but a blessing as it can help you to emerge as the best, says PARMINDER GILL

John McEnroe was No 1 tennis player from 1980 to 1984 and one of the finest shot-making players in tennis the world has ever seen. But the world also remembers him as abusive, arrogant and entitled from his behavior on the court. Contrast him with another tennis champion of recent times — Roger Federer. For Federer, losing or making mistakes is not a sign of weakness, but a blessing, because they help him hone what he needs to work on to improve and be his best. Moral of the story: One might still succeed in a vocation purely because of natural ability or talent, but this success is always pre-determined,and one should be careful that the pursuit of success at any cost does not leave behind a negative atmosphere in its wake.

Learning to lose or fail is one of the most critical attributes required for being successful in any sphere of life. Carol Dweck, a famous psychologist talks about the growth mindset which allows us to learn from our failures and improve our abilities in contrast to a fixed mindset, where we shirk failures, and think that our abilities are carved in stone or can’t be improved.

A fixed mindset, as it assumes a fixed ability or aptitude, does not know how to deal with or learn from failures and greatly limits the growth of an individual.

In one of the studies conducted by Dweck and her team, they found that children who displayed a 'growth mindset' displayed higher levels of achievement in school (and outside) in areas where success could be measured, regardless of their initial aptitude.

They also found that children from poorer households, who displayed a growth mindset, on an average performed as better, as children from high income households who had access to a far better quality of education.

In India, this insight holds huge promise in how we approach education (public or private) for hundreds of millions of children who come from low income group households and may not have access to high quality education.

How does one learn to develop a growth mindset or an ability to learn from failures?

Our decade long experiments in using sport in schools have shown us that sport could be a powerful tool to teach critical life-skills including the ability to deal with failures.

Sport can mimic life (on playgrounds) and if used appropriately in learning environments such as schools can help shape right experiences and behaviors of children. Most importantly, the cost of failures extracted on playgrounds is very small compared to costs of failures in real life - so children can be taught to fail often and learn from their mistakes on the playgrounds.

While sport can be a great vehicle for teaching the growth mindset to children, it is not complete without informed adult (parental or teacher) guidance. Caring adults can recognise the right opportunities to get the child to focus squarely on the process or the effort (the notion of practice or training in sport), and not on the outcomes (such as winning or losing).

The adult could also make the child realise the importance of deliberate practice where by applying herself to any task or vocation (and learning continually from mistakes), she can increase her aptitude and abilities significantly in that task.

In the words of an ancient philosopher, to succeed is to have failed, and to fail is to have succeeded. This philosopher certainly knew how failures always predicate success, but success by itself means nothing besides being a positive outcome of an event.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---in-order-to-succeed--failure-is-important---.html
198,18-3-20,MindIT,"The Indian economy is already showing upward trends more as professional establishments and manufacturing businesses are choosing the country as their new destination. The contributions from women professionals and business owners have also increased in the last few years. The most promising part of India is its young population which ranks highest among the total population count ranging between 15-28 years of age.

These statistics also suggests that businesses should now start to create new opportunities for diverse people to join and contribute in an effective manner in order to get closer to new trends of demand and consumption. Such contributions should also come from the women workforce of the organisations.

A free hand to possibilities: Indian businesses and corporates now realise that they seriously consider strategising gender parity in the overall workforce. Women in India have grown confident about their professional capabilities. Women employees and technicians are loaded in possibilities to become an integral part of heavy industries by squaring exclusive sense of control and temerity to bring-on-board profit-yielding leaderships and new executive practices through collaborative work culture. The businesses should persuade such possibilities by creating opportunity and fostering inclusivity with the current workforce.

One such unique initiative was launched by a company in 2012 — the Pink Assembly Line (assembly line for scooters managed entirely by the women workers). Under this initiative 200 women workers received the industrial training by being on the job. The three-year programme managed to build a better culture in the company where both men and women employees can work together at the shop floors and contribute in the most effective way towards the growth of the company.

It soon became a cult in a variety of other company's shop floors where gender equity in highly skilled jobs were found to be gaining strength in the following years. Such initiative was taken against a stark and contrary treatment of not offering employment to women in the heavy industries.

Learn first, train next: Women empowerment programmes are only the first step and not an all-inclusive programme. Women in the industry should be empowered with the vision to grow as leaders and not just workers. In the new world of competent business research and highly efficient customer management, the potential of women employees should be exploited to nurture a leader of future who can take up responsibilities of various departments and divisions.

Supporting women workers and employees to learn and deliver in cross-functional jobs should be organised in order to explore and discover their natural skills of leaderships. Such skillsets including time management, interpersonal skills and customer perspectives when compared to men have been found like what chalk is to cheese. Therefore, the industry should support such diverse skills by nurturing and productively utilising it for growth and profit.

there are several companies that that flexible work hours which for example, is supporting white collar women employees to handle their domestic chores along with a highly skilled managerial job. The comfort and challenges that women face are different from men and the policy infrastructure should adequately support it. In such organisations, special care is taken by the division heads after the women employees join after maternity leave in order to ensure her health and concerns of childcare remains a top priority. A healthy mother and child can guarantee a prosperous future.

201,18-3-20,Things to know while preparing for IELTS,"In order to clear the IELTS exam, it is important that students pay attention to listening, reading, speaking and writing skills, says ROHIT SETHI

Most Indians dream of pursuing higher education abroad or working in foreign locations. However, doing so is not that easy as it sounds. One of the most common criteria that several institutions or organisations ask from foreign candidates is International English Language Testing System (IELTS), in the absence of which individuals won’t be permitted to operate overseas.

The IELTS is a standardised proficiency test that analyses and evaluates a candidate’s command over the English and this is why scoring well in this test becomes essential for anyone who wishes to study or work outside their home countries. The IELTS is a two-hour-45-minute test with four sections: Listening, reading, writing and speaking. How one can prepare for IELTS?

Timed Practice: It is always advised to take the test early. Doing so will not only allow you to experience the test but also give you a clear picture of where do you land at the moment.

Enhance listening skills: Start following and listening to the top English speakers regularly until you become familiar with their accent and understanding their pronunciation becomes a hassle-free task.

Developing reading skills: Read more and more newspapers, magazines or novels, either in print or online. The more you read the more your vocabulary will advance and this will have a direct positive impact on your writing skills as well.

Strengthening writing skills: Take mock tests and keep writing in your downtime. In fact, write on any topic that interests you – be it politics, sports, storytelling, anything; this will help you develop a knack around writing on different topics and enhance and add pace to your writing.

Practice pronunciation and fluency: Start having conversations with friends and family members in English. Speak at a moderate speed to allow the person to easily comprehend what you are saying.

203,18-3-20,Last-minute prep hacks,"With only three weeks left for JEE MAINS, it’s time for students to follow a disciplined approach. While self-study is crucial, Vishnu Dutt Sharma lists a few dos and don’ts that will help them to ace the exam

The JEE MAINS 2020 is just a few weeks away and the aspirants are fighting tooth and nail to get through the exams that they’ve been preparing for the last two years. Although, it’s natural for them to feel a little more stressed during this period, but if planned carefully, it can be easily avoided.

While following a consistent and disciplined approach is a key to crack IIT Main examinations; it is also crucial to pay attention to speed and the amount of time given to each question. Self-study is extremely helpful but at the same time group studies or coaching is a great option to clear one’s doubts and queries.

With a month to go, students should examine and analyse their weak areas and common mistakes and thoroughly practice those to get better marks in the JEE exams. It is advisable to assign more time on topics and subjects that an aspirant is not very confident about. This time should be spent wisely on memorising the formulas, method of calculations and the time taken to solve a particular question in order to prepare themselves for the exams.

The best way a student can get the feel of the exam, prepare themselves for a three-hour paper and know their actual strengths and weaknesses is by solving a mock paper. Students must go through the last few years’ question papers and solve more and more of them to feel confident before they appear for the main exams. Solving mock papers not just helps in estimating the time spend on each question but also helps in selecting and prioritising the important questions first.

Besides good and quality preparation, it is necessary to relax and have a good sleep at night. During and before the examination, it is important to have a rich and healthy diet and keeping hydrated.

Here is a set of do’s and don’ts that can easily help the young aspirants to sail through the preparation period and during the day of the main examination:-

Dos

Assign 7-8 hours every day on a subject

Do not proceed ahead without clearing your doubts; clear your doubts regularly

Solve as many questions as possible with a paper and pen

Check the syllabus from the JEE website and make a note of all the relevant things

To check your speed and accuracy, give regular mock tests

Do a detailed test analysis after every test

Don’ts

Never pile up your doubts; if you are stuck somewhere, seek help

Do not compare your studying pattern with your peers; everyone has a unique strategy to study

Do not spend too much time on a single topic

Never give a test without a time limit

Avoid last-minute study, as this will just build tension in your mind. You must feel relaxed.

Here are some important topics that you must pay attention to:-

Maths :

Complex Number

Conic Section

Circle

Calculus

Vector & 3 D

Probability

Trigonometric Equation

Properties of Triangles

Quadratic Equation

Sequence and Series

Permutations and combination

Chemistry

Chemical bonding

Electrochemistry

Coordination compound

Salt analysis

Ionic equilibrium

Thermodynamics & thermochemistry

Aldehydes and ketones

Aromatic hydrocarbons

GOC isomerism

Liquid solutions

Alkyl halides and aryl halides

Physics

Rotational Motion

Thermodynamics (Thermal Physics)

SHM

Electrostatics

Optics

Modern Physics

Keep these small things in mind and you will surely get amazing results. Take care of yourself and wishing you all the best!

205,18-3-20,Let’s team up,"A successful team is one which efficiently splits tasks and manages time efficiently. Vidya Sam shares tips that can help

For any team to flourish, it requires harmony, companionship, one vision and a great leader who could ensure all of these are available. A successful team is one which efficiently splits tasks and effectively manages time. If your team has some of these traits, you are good to go but if you have them all, your team is unbeatable and smart.

But what makes a team so great? What are those elements which could enhance the team performance? How could leaders be better at their job?

Here are three most important team-building tips that a leader must know:

Build relationships, relationships will build team: We are social animals — we desire companionship and constructive relationships just as much we need food and water. In other words, the better our relationships, the more joyful and progressively profitable our work life is. Great working connections give us a few more advantages: our work becomes progressively pleasant. Additionally, people tend to accept changes that organisations need to actualise, and this way they can become progressive and innovative.

In addition, great relationships at work give organisations an opportunity: rather than investing time and energy in dealing with negativity, we can, rather, center around concerns that matter the most. Clients, suppliers and key stakeholders are overall fundamental to an organisation’s well-being. In this way, it’s essential to create and keep great relations with other colleagues.

How can you establish a good relationship with your team?

When you form good relations with your partners, you structure an incredible network that encourages you to work and become more successful. If you believe the individuals you work with, you can be transparent in your messages and activities, and you know they are always watching your back.

The better and more viably you speak with people around you, the more extravagant your connections will be.

Give importance to colleagues so they could feel their assessments are considered and that they can altogether accomplish the hierarchical objectives.

Invest in your colleagues’ personal development. People often leave bad environment more than for a higher renumeration. It is essential for an individual’s growth to keep learning, stay creative, and recognise their latent talents.

Devote sometime of your day for relationship building, even if it’s just 20 minutes. Take out time to recall one thing each one of you is thankful for.

Be transparent: A transparent working environment supports fear-free environment, one that urges everyone to be open about their accomplishments and shortcomings and would overall be able to make a more secure, progressively positive atmosphere.

Communicate down the hierarchy, loud and clear: Among different advantages, open communications constructs kinship and trust between colleagues, ensures straightforwardness in the environment, empowers employee management, supports confidence, and encourages organisational development.

Building a successful team is no cakewalk. The process is about establishing trust among each other and with the right set of skills, a leader can convey, assist, and create a healthy working atmosphere.

206,18-3-20,Shed the burden,"It is believed that BhraguRishu, a great saint, started writing about all animals present on the earth, air, water and human beings. He wanted to write the characteristics of each living being about their life span, their events in their life, good or bad in advance which will go up to thousands of years. But he realised that it was a difficult task therefore, he dropped the idea of writing about karma of every living being and only focused on the karma of human beings.

He wrote in detail about each and every individual which existed even prior to the birth and also wrote about the fate and destiny of millions and billions of people yet to be born in coming centuries. This was an amazing work done by him which is appreciated even today. While writing about the various people, he observed that certain numbers are typical and are linked to specific characters.

Every individual who is born on this earth will have to bear the fruits of his karma, many times the mistakes are done and also there is an abuse of the gifts which have been provided by the nature. These errors are carried along with the person as an added burden so as to realise and learn a particular lesson that he failed to learn in the previous life. The burden carried by the individuals is the mis-deeds of the previous generation and is known as karmic debt numbers. The karmic debt is a significant difficulty in this life as payment for the misapplication of energies in a past life.

These numbers are 19, 16, 14 and 13. A person who is either born on 19, 16, 14 or 13 of any month or whose destiny number is 19, 16, 14 or 13 is supposed to have karmic debt. Out of these four karmic debt, the degree of punishment or effectiveness is highest in the people with karmic debt 19, the next are 16, 14 and 13 in order of decreasing the effects of karmic debt. It is mildest in case of 13 and strongest in case of 19.

The karmic debt is concerned or effective after the age of 25& continues upto the age of 50. It means during this period, a person will rise to the top, will drop abruptly to the ground and will start again. It means in these 25 years, he will have many ups and down, peaks and bottoms. If a person has psychic number or year number 13 and the destiny number 19, he will experience such type of rise and fall throughout his life. He may experience failures, accidents, negativity and down fall.

This theory says no person can escape or get salvation until he has paid back for the sins, wrong things, frauds, exploitation, theft or for that matter any act done which has damaged or caused problems for anyone emotionally or financially. He has to definitely settle the account of his misdeed in one, two or more number of birth/rebirth.

“I will never understand how people feel so freely to say these things to another human being,” he said.

“I have given a lot of thought about reacting to this and I hope that no one else has to deal with stuff like this on a regular basis, it isn’t ever acceptable and should be addressed properly in my opinion.”

211,18-3-20,‘No need for any drastic decisions' on Tokyo Olympics: IOC,"The International Olympic Committee said on Tuesday it was not the time for “drastic decisions” over the staging of the Tokyo Olympics, which has not yet been postponed because of the deadly coronavirus pandemic.

“The IOC remains fully committed to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, and with more than four months to go before the Games there is no need for any drastic decisions at this stage; and any speculation at this moment would be counter-productive,” the IOC said in a statement after its executive board met in Lausanne.

The Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to run between July 24-August 9, but the year’s biggest sporting event is as yet one of the sole sporting competitions to have survived a postponement in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak that has caused more than 7,400 deaths and infected more than 180,000 around the world.

“This is an unprecedented situation for the whole world, and our thoughts are with all those affected by this crisis,” the IOC said.

IOC president Thomas Bach added: “The health and well-being of all those involved in the preparations for the Olympic Tokyo 2020 is our number-one concern.

“All measures are being taken to safeguard the safety and interests of athletes, coaches and support teams. We are an Olympic community; we support one another in good times and in difficult times. This Olympic solidarity defines us as a community.”

The IOC acknowledged preparations for the Tokyo Games had been impacted, and encouraged all athletes to continue training “as best they can”.

“The IOC has confidence that the many measures being taken by many authorities around the world will help contain the situation of the COVID-19 virus.”

Practical adaptations

One of the results of the virus outbreak has been the cancellation of qualifiers, in a number of sports, for the Tokyo Olympics.

But the IOC insisted it would work to surmount any difficulties that threw up.

“To date, 57 percent of the athletes are already qualified for the Games,” it said. “For the remaining 43 percent of places, the IOC will work with the IFs (international federations) to make any necessary and practical adaptations to their respective qualification systems for Tokyo 2020.”

The IOC vowed to “continue to act in a responsible way and have agreed the following overriding principles about the staging of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020:

“1. To protect the health of everyone involved and to support the containment of the virus. 2. To safeguard the interests of the athletes and of Olympic sport.”

The IOC will continue to monitor the situation 24/7. Already in mid-February, a task force was set up .

The body added any decision it takes on the staging of the Games “will not be determined by financial interests, because thanks to its risk management policies and insurance it will in any case be able to continue its operations and accomplish its mission to organise the Olympic Games”.

A taskforce (consisting of the IOC, the World Health Organisation, the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, the Japanese authorities and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government) was created in mid-February to ensure “coordinated actions by all stakeholders” and offer guidance the IOC said it would follow.

Already, the format of all the test events in March and April in Japan has been “altered to allow for the testing of essential Games elements”.

“The lighting of the Olympic torch in Greece and subsequent elements of the Torch Relay in Japan are being adapted, the entire Games preparation supply chain has been analysed, and alternative plans are in place in the event of anticipated disruption,” the IOC said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---no-need-for-any-drastic-decisions--on-tokyo-olympics--ioc.html

The 22-year-old Chopra has been training in Turkey for the last one month. He qualified for the Tokyo Games in a competition in South Africa with a throw of 87.86m, having made his return from an elbow surgery last year.

“Turkey is closing its borders on March 18 and Neeraj has to fly out before that. He is reaching home on Wednesday,” an official of the Athletics Federation of India said.

“He (Neeraj) is also not taking part in the Doha leg of the Diamond League on April 17,” he added.

Another Indian javelin thrower Shivpal Singh, who has also qualified for the Tokyo Games, is also returning home from his Potchefstroom — his training base — in South Africa.

“Shivpal is also returning from South Africa. There will be no Indian left training abroad. In this situation, you never know when a country closes its borders or cancels flights. We cannot take chances as athletes may remain stranded,” the AFI official.

216,18-3-20,"All national camps, except those preparing for Olympics, postponed","All national camps, except for those where athletes are preparing for Tokyo Olympics, were on Tuesday postponed until further order in view of the COVID-19 pandemic with the Sports Authority of India (SAI) making arrangements for the return of the trainees to their homes.

Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju said the academic training at the National Centre of Excellence and Sports Auhtority of India Centres will also be suspended.

“Due to Covid-19, SAI has decided that: All National camps shall be postponed except for those where athletes are being trained as part of Olympics #Tokyo2020 preparation,” Rijiju tweeted.

“Academic training in National Centre of Excellence & STCs shall be suspended till further order,” he added.

Rijiju said the move is temporary and precautionary and training will resume if the situation caused by the pandemic improves.

“This is just a temporary and precautionary step for the safety of our sportspersons. I appeal all our young athletes not to be disheartened. We will resume the academic trainings soon after assessing the situation.”

Later SAI stated that no tournament, sports function, seminar and workshop will be held till clearance is obtained and restrictions are withdrawn by the central or state authorities.

Hostel facilities of the trainees, however, might be kept open till March 20 to avoid inconvenience to athletes.

“Athletes who have an exam to take in the next few days will be allowed to stay at the center and take the exam. However, it is being ensured that all health procedures are followed and the highest level of hygiene is maintained so that athletes staying back do not catch an infection,” the SAI said.

“All other trainees are being sent back home after intimation to parents and while following travel precautions. Those who have their home town within 400 kilometers of the centre will be provided AC-3 tier train ticket. Those whose hometowns are beyond 400 kilometers will be provided with an air ticket.”

217,18-3-20,PSL postponed,"The ongoing Pakistan Super League (PSL) was on Tuesday suspended after the country’s Cricket Board revealed that a foreign player showed symptoms of the dreaded COVID-19 with former captain-turned-commentator Ramiz Raja claiming that it was England’s Alex Hales.

The PSL had entered the knockout stages and semifinal matches were due to be played on Tuesday and final on Wednesday in Lahore. The PCB had also shortened the league by four days considering the worsening coronavirus situation but was forced to call it off on Tuesday.

“...This new development came after a player who left Pakistan told us that (he has) symptoms and this (decision to suspend PSL) isn’t in light of being panicked...We made our decision after thorough deliberation,” PCB CEO Wasim Khan said.

“But before this there was no suspected case at all, which is why the decision wasn’t made before,” he added.

Pakistan’s former Test captain Raja claimed that Hales might be the player being suspected. As a precautionary measure, all PSL players and broadcasters are now being tested for the virus.

“What I know is that he is yet to have tests but we don’t know whether the symptoms he has is of Corona or not. But we all now need to be very cautious and obviously adopt a common sense approach to deal with this problem,” Raja said.

The 31-year-old Hales, a right-handed opener, has gone into self-isolation after reaching England.

In the PSL semifinals, Multan Sultans were to take on Peshawar Zalmi at 2pm at the Gaddafi Stadium, followed by a clash between Karachi Kings and Lahore Qalandars at the same venue in the evening.

Most of the 34 foreign players, who took part in the PSL, began heading home last week after the PCB said it would not stop anyone from withdrawing from the league due to the Coronavirus fears.

Responding to a question Khan said that the Karachi Kings team had reservations about playing in the tournament and the decision was then made after consulting all the franchises.

“We have done everything to ensure health and safety of everyone because of the coronavirus and we consulted the government and health officials in all decisions,” he said.

The PCB on Monday called off an upcoming ODI and Test against Bangladesh next month. It also suspended its national one-day cup which was to begin from March 25 in Karachi.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/psl-postponed.html

“Like many other overseas players, I reluctantly left the Pakistan Super League early because with COVID-19 reaching global pandemic status, I felt it was more important to be with my family rather than face a period of lockdown thousands of miles from home,” Hales said in a statement after the PCB’s comment.

“I returned to the UK in the early hours of Saturday morning feeling perfectly fit and healthy and with absolutely no symptoms of the virus,” he added.

Hales plays for Karachi Kings in the PSL.

“However, I awoke early on Sunday morning having developed a fever and followed the governments advice of self-isolation, a process I am obviously still following having developed a dry and persistent cough.

“At this stage, it has not been possible to be tested although I am hopeful that might be the case later today so I can get absolute confirmation of my current health status,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/have-not-get-myself-tested-but-have-fever---dry-cough--hales.html
219,18-3-20,Test c’ship without Ind-Pak tie makes no sense: Waqar,"Former pace great Waqar Younis said it doesn’t make sense that the ICC World Test Championship don’t feature any match between arch-rivals India and Pakistan.

The World Test Championship features nine top-ranked Test teams, who will play six bilateral Test series against mutually chosen opponents with the top two nations with most points at the end of the league clashing in the final in England in June 2021.

“I know it is a difficult situation between Pakistan and India even at government to government level but I think the ICC needed to play a more proactive role in this championship,” Waqar said in an interview to the YouTube channel.

“The ICC should have intervened and done something because to me having a test championship without Pakistan and India Test matches makes no sense,” he said.

Since the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, India hasn’t toured Pakistan. The two neighbours have also not played a full Test bilateral series since 2007 due to strained political and diplomatic relations.

Waqar lamented that due to the on and off strained relations with India, he got to play only four Tests against them in an international career spanning 14-years, featuring 87 Tests and 262 ODIs.

“It’s always been like this that is why making my test debut against India is something I don’t forget,” he said.

Waqar also praised the wealth of pace talent coming through in India.

“If you see India has really worked hard in this area and they are now producing bowlers regularly who bowl in the 140 plus range.

“In the past it was not like this. But things have changed. (Jasprit) Bumrah, (Mohammed) Shami, Ishant (Sharma) they have taken India to the top. That is why India is doing so well in Test and other formats now,” he said.

Waqar also pointed out that India had a very clear rotation policy for its pace bowlers.

“If you look at their Test side they have more or less a settled combination of pace bowlers for this format but in the white ball formats they keep on changing and experimenting which is good.”

Waqar said as Pakistan bowling coach he also wanted to experiment with the bowlers in limited over cricket, while having a settled group of bowlers for Test cricket who could serve the country for the next 5 to 8 years.

“My policy is to keep on giving chances and experimenting in ODIs and T20 cricket. Give those bowlers a chance who are in form at a time. It is not that I ignore those who have performed consistently well in domestic cricket. Muhammad Abbas, Imran Khan are examples,” he said.

The 48-year-old said cricket has changed a lot compared to when he played and fast bowlers lack aggression now.

“Nowadays cricket is different and as a result I feel pace bowlers are more defensive minded now to counter the changed rules, broader bats and easy pitches.

“In my days we always believed that aggression and attack was a must for fast bowlers and we got success.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/test-c---ship-without-ind-pak-tie-makes-no-sense--waqar.html

The Grand Slam event was to have taken place from May 24 to June 7, but organisers said: “The current confinement measures have made it impossible for us to continue with our preparations and, as a result, we are unable to hold the tournament on the dates originally planned.”

The new dates would mean the tournament would start just one week after the US Open, if that event remains in its scheduled slot.

“The whole world is affected by the public health crisis connected with COVID-19. In order to ensure the health and safety of everyone involved in organising the tournament, the French Tennis Federation has made the decision to hold the 2020 edition of Roland-Garros from 20th September to 4th October 2020,” read a statement.

“In order to act responsibly and protect the health of its employees, service providers and suppliers during the organisation period, the FFT has chosen the only option that will allow them to maintain the 2020 edition of the tournament while joining the fight against COVID-19.”

FFT president Bernard Giudicelli said: ""We have made a difficult yet brave decision in this unprecedented situation, which has evolved greatly since last weekend. We are acting responsibly, and must work together in the fight to ensure everybody’s health and safety.”

Last week, the ATP announced it was suspending the men’s tennis tour for six weeks “due to escalating health and safety issues” arising from spread of the virus.

All events on the ATP Tour and second-tier ATP Challenger Tour are cancelled until April 27.

The International Tennis Federation, which runs the lower tiers of the professional game as well as the junior and senior circuits, followed the ATP by announcing there would be no tournaments on any of its tours until April 20 at the earliest.

222,18-3-20,We’re all waiting to hear from IPL: Kane Richardson,"Australia pacer Kane Richardson has said he and other Australian players are waiting to hear from Indian Premier League (IPL) about the next step after the cash-rich tournament was postponed due to coronavirus outbreak.

17 Australians hold Indian Premier League contracts, which was scheduled to start on March 29 but has been suspended till April 15.

“We’re just waiting to hear,” Kane told cricket.com.au where he detailed about the quarantine experience he had to undergo after complaining of a sore throat before the first ODI of the Chappell Hadlee series, which now stands cancelled.

“A lot of the blokes have opinions — ‘it’s going to get cancelled’, this and that — but again it can change in a day or a week, so I’ll just sit by the phone and get ready to play for the 15th at the moment — that’s what I’m thinking.

“(The Australia squad) were all sitting around chatting about it. It’s happened out of nowhere.

“A lot of us were going to be away from now till the end of the IPL, so to now be sitting at home with absolutely no idea when the next game of cricket is going to be for any of us, just shows how quickly this has grown.

“Even a week ago we were flying back from South Africa and there was no thought of coronavirus at all in the air or when we got back to the airport.

“It's hard to believe we’re sitting here at home with everything being cancelled but when you watch the news and see what’s going on in the world, it’s definitely the right call.

“I think the main issue that a lot of boys had was travelling away from home and if you happen to catch it, you’re stuck in a hotel room for two weeks. That’s the sticking point I reckon a lot of the guys were uncomfortable with.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we---re-all-waiting-to-hear-from-ipl--kane-richardson.html
223,18-3-20,Cricket Australia likely to review IPL contracts,"Australian cricketers may have to forego their lucrative IPL contracts in the wake of fast-spreading novel coronavirus, the local media reported on Tuesday.

Cricket Australia has not directed the players officially with its chief executive Kevin Roberts on Tuesday saying that players were individually contracted to their IPL teams and can make up their own minds to compete in the 2020 IPL or not.

“We can provide advice. We’re conscious of the fact that Australian players are individually contracted to the IPL and the time will certainly come very soon where players are going to be really interested and leaning on our perspective as their leader... To advise them in that regard,” Roberts said.

“And then there will also be a perspective from the BCCI and their IPL division within that and together with our players and the BCCI, I am sure players will reach the best possible decisions in uncertain circumstances.”

The Australian newspaper reported that Cricket Australia is reviewing whether it should permit its players to participate in the IPL or The Hundred series in the UK. There are 17 Australian players contracted with different IPL franchisees.

The Australia report said that pacer Pat Cummins, former skipper Steve Smith, opener David Warner and all-rounder Glenn Maxwell could be asked to give up their rich contracts.

224,18-3-20,Allow Olympic-bound Indian athletes to train after test: Vimal,"With the COVID-19 pandemic halting all sport activities, India’s former chief badminton coach Vimal Kumar on Tuesday urged the government to allow the Olympic-bound athletes to continue their training after conducting the required tests.

Following the respective directives of the Talengana and Karnataka governments, the Pullela Gopichand academy in Hyderbad and Prakash Padukone Academy in Bangalore have been shut down for two weeks.

Rio Silver medallist P V Sindhu, men’s singles player B Sai Praneeth and men’s doubles pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy have so far assured themselves of a berth at the Tokyo Olympics.

“I feel sad for the sports community. They follow healthy lifestyle, they have good immunity unlike general public. So I believe the government should look at ways to test these athletes who have already qualified and allow them to train,” Vimal said.

“If it was some other year I wouldn’t have said so but it is an Olympic year, it comes after every four years. So put them through constant testing and even if some test positive I believe they will recover in two weeks time.”

“In badminton, look what China, Japan or Korea are doing. They are staying in different countries and training. Here we have hardly 100 odd people who have qualified for Olympics. They have to be looked at a little bit differently,” Vimal said. Sindhu’s father PV Ramana said at least the shuttlers who have qualified for Olympics should be allowed to train at the Gopichand academy.

“Badminton is not a contact sports, so you can maintain that 5 feet distance. So I believe at least players who have qualified should be allowed to train. Otherwise, if you don’t train for 15 days, it will take another two months to get back to match fitness,” he said.

“There are 8 courts at the academy, so it is possible to allow Sindhu, Sai and Chirag-Satwik to continue their on-court training. There will be hardly a few players and they can take the necessary precautions, and still train,” said Ramana, a former India volleyball player.

With the Gopichand academy locked down, Sindhu and Praneeth are trying to find ways to keep themselves fit.

“The two week break will affect our fitness. The gym in my apartment has also been shut so I don’t have any way to work on my fitness. I take long walks and jog inside the campus,” Praneeth said.

“There is lot of uncertainty right now. If things improve, how will the BWF go about organising the events, we don’t know. But nothing is in our hand.”

Ramana, who was part of the team that won a Bronze at the 1986 Asian Games, said he is trying different ways to keep Sindhu fit.

“She is doing some light exercise at the terrace like dips and leg works. Our house is in a hilly area, there is no movement of people or vehicles in that road, so she is doing some jogging, stretching and exercises for strengthening for legs in morning and evening,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/allow-olympic-bound-indian-athletes-to-train-after-test--vimal.html

Singh staged a protest near a Bengaluru resort this morning where rebel MLAs of Madhya Pradesh Congress are staying, and demanded that he be allowed to meet them.

Singh, who has been detained by the police, accused the BJP of holding the MLAs captive and said that he would go on a ""hunger strike"".

Reacting to this, Nath said if the need arises he would also go to the Karnataka capital.

""Preventing Congress Rajya Sabha candidate and other ministers from meeting MLAs, misbehave with them, forcibly taken them into custody is totally a dictatorship and hitlershahi (sic),"" Nath said in a tweet.

""Entire country is watching how an elected government is being made unstable and how BJP is murdering democratic values,"" Nath said.

""Why they are not allowing them to meet MLAs. What BJP is afraid of. BJP is playing a dirty political game in the state,"" the chief minister tweeted.

Demanding immediate release of detained Congress leaders, Nath said that democratic norms and Constitutional values are being stifled.

Later speaking to reporters, the CM said, ""Why the BJP is afraid of presenting 16 MLAs here (Bhopal)? What is the problem in one person (Singh) meeting with 16 legislators?""

232,18-3-20,Copa America moves next yr,"The Copa America due to kick off in June in Argentina and Colombia was on Tuesday postponed by a year to 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic, organisers CONMEBOL said.

The announcement came shortly after UEFA’s decision to also push back Euro by 12 months.

The Copa is South America’s main continental competition between national sides and had been scheduled to run between June 12-July 12.

The competition was being staged for the first time in two countries rather than one.

The finals featuring 12 teams, for this edition included invitees Australia and Qatar.

“It’s an extraordinary measure due to an unexpected situation, and therefore responds to the fundamental need to avoid an exponential evolution of the virus,” said CONMEBOL.

The tournament is now rescheduled to run from June 11-July 11 2021.

“We also thank UEFA and its president Aleksander Ceferin for working together and the co-ordinated decision to also postpone the 2020 Euros for the betterment of the whole football family,” added CONMEBOL.

The South American governing body had decided to align the Copa, which mostly used to be played in odd years, to the Euros in order to reduce the impact on European clubs, where a large number of South American internationalss ply their trade.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/copa-america---moves-next-yr.html
233,18-3-20,UEFA postpone Euro to 2021,"European Football’s governing body delay Euro championship by one year due to coronavirus

The European championship, due to be played in June and July this year, has been postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic, European football’s governing body UEFA said on Tuesday.

UEFA said the new proposed dates for the tournament were June 11 to July 11 next year, as Euro 2020 becomes Euro 2021.

It said the postponement would “will help all domestic competitions, currently on hold due to the COVID-19 emergency, to be completed”.

The announcement comes after UEFA held crisis talks with its national associations as well as clubs and players bodies via videoconference, as the continent fights to deal with the health crisis.

“The health of all those involved in the game is the priority, as well as to avoid placing any unnecessary pressure on national public services involved in staging matches,” UEFA said in a statement.

Most of Europe’s domestic leagues have ground to a halt over the last week as football confronts its biggest issue in modern times.

Europe has become the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, with France on Tuesday joining Italy and Spain in applying strict lockdown measures and European leaders also planning to ban all non-essential travel into the continent.

More than 2,100 people have died in Italy, which was supposed to host the opening game of Euro 2020 in Rome.

The UEFA Champions League and Europa League competitions for clubs have been suspended, with both still in the last-16 stage, but postponing the European Championship means they, along with national leagues, will have the chance to be completed, assuming travel restrictions are lifted in time.

‘Full support’ for changes

UEFA has set up a working group involving leagues and clubs which will try to come up with a new match calendar to allow for the season to be completed.

Twenty of the 24 nations set to take part in the Euro have already qualified, but play-offs to determine the final four participants, due to be played this month, have been postponed.

UEFA said those matches, and other scheduled friendlies, would now be played in June “subject to a review of the situation.”

South America’s equivalent of the Euro, the Copa America, also scheduled for this June and July, has also been postponed by a year, ensuring European-based players will be free to finish the season with their clubs.

The move was welcomed by national associations in countries currently battling the pandemic.

“People’s health and well-being has to be the primary concern for us all, so we fully support UEFA’s decision to postpone EURO 2020,” said the English FA’s CEO, Mark Bullingham.

Meanwhile, French Football Federation (FFF) president Noel Le Graet gave the postponement his “full support”, calling it a “wise and pragmatic decision”.

Knock-on effects

Euro 2020 was due to be held in 12 countries. There is no suggestion the format or number of venues will change.

The semi-finals and final are supposed to be played in London and there will be considerable knock-on effects from the postponement — the women’s European Championship is scheduled to run from July 7 to August 1 next year in England, with the final at Wembley.

UEFA also planned to stage an Under-21 Euro in Hungary and Slovenia in June next year.

Moving the Euro by a year also puts UEFA on a collision course with football’s world governing body FIFA, whose president Gianni Infantino has planned to stage the inaugural edition of his highly lucrative Club World Cup in June and July next year in China.

However, Infantino indicated in an open letter on Monday that FIFA will “look to find in due course solutions in a spirit of cooperation, taking into account the interests of football at all levels”.

UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin thanked Infantino for his intervention and for saying FIFA will do “whatever is required to make this new calendar work”.

“In the face of this crisis, football has shown its best side with openness, solidarity and tolerance,” Ceferin said.

As for its club competitions, UEFA could still come to a decision to try to complete the Champions League and Europa League by curtailing the competitions, meaning ties up to the semi-finals could be decided in one-off matches.

Reports on Tuesday indicated both tournaments could conclude with a ‘Final Four’ meeting in the scheduled host cities — Istanbul for the Champions League and Gdansk in Poland for the Europa League.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uefa-postpone-euro-to-2021-2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/uefa-postpone-euro-to-2021.html
234,18-3-20,Monkeygate was lowest point of my captaincy: Ponting,"Australia's two-time world Cup-winning former skipper Ricky Ponting considers the 2008 'Monkeygate' scandal the lowest point of his captaincy stint as he feels he was not in control of what was happened at that time.

The scandal unfolded when senior Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh was charged with racially abusing Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds during the second Test at Sydney.

""Monkeygate was probably the lowest (point in career as captain). Losing the 2005 Ashes series was tough but I was in full control of that. But I wasn't in full control of what happened during the Monkeygate thing,"" Ponting, who led Australia to 48 wins from 77 Tests and 164 triumphs in 228 ODIs, told a 'Skysports' podcast.

Harbhajan was eventually cleared of the charge and Symonds' career went into a downward spiral after the incident.

""It was a low point and also because it dragged on for so long. I remember coming off the ground during the Adelaide Test match and speaking to Cricket Australia officials about the case because the hearing was at the end of the Adelaide Test match,"" Ponting added.

The incident created a lot of bitterness between the two teams with India threatening to pull out of the tour before the ICC intervened.

""We all felt let down by the end result (of the the Monkeygate controversy). The fact that it got in the way of the way we played our cricket for the next Test match was probably the most disappointing thing,"" said the Australia batting great.

""So we go over there and India at Perth is game we expect to win and then we lost the match and after that the next few days things just got worse and worse,"" he went on to add.

Under Ponting's captaincy, Australia also suffered Ashes defeats in 2005, 2009 and 2010-11.

""The first two probably hurt more because we were expected to win more, certainly in 2005,"" he said.

""Everyone in 2005 expected us to just come over here, whitewash them [England] again and come back with the Ashes. That didn't happen that way.

""Certainly, for me, the 2005 defeat was the hardest to cope with. But 2010-11, we were just completely outplayed.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/monkeygate-was-lowest-point-of-my-captaincy--ponting-2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/monkeygate-was-lowest-point-of-my-captaincy--ponting.html
235,18-3-20,When Kohli's aggressive celebrations during 2018-19 tour made Langer feel like a punching bag,"Australian coach Justin Langer has revealed that he felt like a ""punching bag"" after Virat Kohli's aggressive celebrations during India's 2018-19 tour while also calling out the ""double standards"" when it comes to sledging in cricket.

India, led by Kohli, enjoyed an unprecedented summer Down Under, winning the Border Gavaskar Trophy 3-1, their first-ever Test series win on the Australian soil. It was followed by a 2-1 victory in the ODIs, while the T20 series ended in a 1-1 draw.

During the series, Australia, who were determined to patch up their severely dented image in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal, had decided to not engage with the Indian captain verbally during the series.

However, Kohli's on-field antics angered Langer but he could not be expressive about it.

""I remember that afternoon (feeling) like a punching bag. We can't fight back because it felt like we had our hands behind our backs and we just had to take it,"" Langer said in Amazon's recently released docu-series titled 'The Test'.

""You must be feeling the double standards the way their captain is carrying on and we sort of have to be careful. Imagine if we behaved two out of ten (of) that,"" he said.

Langar asked his players to take on Kohli but warned the hosts not to cross the line between banter and abuse.

""There is a difference between abuse and banter. There is no room for abuse. We don't need to abuse him but there is banter where you stick up for your mate.""

On day four of the second Test at Perth, Kohli and his Australian counterpart Tim Paine were involved in a verbal spat. That was time Paine thought he had enough.

""I sort of just had enough and thought you also have to stand up for yourself and your teammates and that was one of the reasons I thought, 'no, I'm the captain, it's my turn, I have to stand up and show him we're here for the fight',"" Paine said.

Paine was at the receiving end just after he had gone out to bat. ""If he messes it up, it's 2-0. Who's gonna talk then?” Kohli was caught saying by the stump microphones.

Paine did not hold himself back and replied ""You've got to bat first, big head"".",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/when-kohli-s-aggressive-celebrations-during-2018-19-tour-made-langer-feel-like-a-punching-bag-2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/when-kohli-s-aggressive-celebrations-during-2018-19-tour-made-langer-feel-like-a-punching-bag.html

Singh, who has been detained by the police, accused the BJP of holding the MLAs captive and said that he would go on a ""hunger strike"".

""BJP MLA Arvind Bhadoriya and an MP are holding them captive. Why can't I meet my MLAs, my voters (for Rajya Sabha election), my own party people. What is the BJP doing in between?"" he said.

Singh alleged that Congress MLAs inside the resort want to meet him, but they are not being allowed.

As the police tried to convince him, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said, ""It is my right to meet my Congress MLAs. I don't want to meet the BJP MLAs. I want to meet the Congress MLAs. People have voted them as Congress MLAs, not as BJP MLAs.""

Singh, landed in the city early on Wednesday morning and he was received at by newly appointed state Congress chief D K Shivakumar, former minister Krishna Byre Gowda and others, party sources said.

The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister then drove straight to the resort, where they were denied entry by police, sources said adding that Shivakumar and other state leaders have also reached the spot.

In a video released by the Congress, Singh is seen saying, ""I'm an ex-chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, who is a Rajya Sabha election candidate. The voting is on March 26. Twenty-two MLAs are staying here and they want to talk to me. But their phones have been taken away and the police are not allowing us to talk to them.""

""The police are saying that the MLAs have a security threat. I have told them (police) that I'm a Gandhian and I don't have a bomb or any rifle, allow them to meet us and I will go back.""

Superintendent of Police (Bengaluru Rural) Bheemashankar S Guled tried to convince Singh, saying the Madhya Pradesh legislators at the resort have sought police protection.

The MLAs have written to the police stating that they don't want to meet anybody as they fear trouble, and the same has been communicated to Singh and others, the police officer said, adding, ""We have also shown the letter to him.""

Questioning the police's claim, Singh said, ""They (police) don't know the MLAs' name or anything, how can we know that he (SP) has spoken to the legislators?""

Claiming that no letter by the MLAs was shown to him, Singh said something on a phone was shown to him which had names of two legislators, ""one of whom had been a minister in my government"".

""Those very MLAs had sent a word to me asking me to come here,"" he said, and alleged that the signatures of MLAs were forged.

The 22 rebel Congress MLAs held a press conference on Tuesday and claimed that 20 more party MLAs want to join them and they were thinking of crossing over to the BJP in the days to come.

In a massive setback for the Congress, its prominent youth leader Jyotiradtya Scindia quit the party and in a coordinated rebellion last week 22 MLAs loyal to him resigned in Madhya Pradesh, pushing the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse.

244,18-3-20,"I’ll speak on RS seat after oath, says Gogoi as Cong raps Govt","Facing all-round criticism for accepting Rajya Sabha seat as Presidential nominee, former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi on Tuesday said he would speak in detail about accepting the offer after he takes the oath.

Talking to reporters who went to meet him at his residence in Guwahati, Gogoi said, “I will go to Delhi probably tomorrow (Wednesday)... Let me first take oath, then I will speak in detail to the media why I accepted this and why I am going to the Rajya Sabha.”

Ironically, last year itself, as CJI Gogoi had observed: “There is a strong viewpoint that post-retirement appointment is a scar on independence of judiciary”.

While Congress reminded the Modi Government the opinion of former Law Minister Arun Jaitley on cooling off period for judges, the CPI(M) urged the President to rescind the nomination of Gogoi.

In a gazette notification on Monday, President Ram Nath Kovind nominated Gogoi to the Council of States to fill the vacancy caused due to the retirement of one of the nominated members.

“I have accepted the offer of the nomination to the Rajya Sabha because of a strong conviction that the legislature and judiciary must at some point of time work together for nation-building. My presence in Parliament will be an opportunity to project the views of the judiciary before the legislature and vice-versa,” he said.

There have been debates in the political circles and other quarters on the nomination of Gogoi, who had retired in November last year as the Chief Justice of India (CJI) after serving for about 13 months.

Gogoi’s former colleagues, Justice (retired) Madan B Lokur commented that the last bastion (read judiciary) has fallen. “There has been speculation for sometimes now about what honorific would Justice Gogoi get. So, in that sense the nomination is not surprising, but what is surprising is that it came so soon. This redefines the independence, impartiality and integrity of the judiciary. Has the last bastion fallen?,” Lokur said in his reaction on Gogoi’s nomination to the Upper House.

Slamming the BJP on the nomination of former CJI, senior Supreme Court advocate and Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi contrasted freedom fighter Subhash Chandra Bose to BJP’s ideology. Quoting Bose’s “Give me blood, I will give you freedom”, Singhvi said the BJP had tweaked it to “Give us a judgment favourable to our ideology, we give you Rajya Sabha seat”. He added that it was not about Gogoi, but about the “concept of independence of the judiciary”.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asked whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi considered the advice of his late Law Minister before nominating Gogoi. “Did PM Modi consider the advice of his former colleague and Law Minister and Finance Minister, Late Sh Arun Jaitley before recommending ex-CJI, Ranjan Gogoi to Rajya Sabha,” he asked on Twitter.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/i---ll-speak-on-rs-seat-after-oath--says-gogoi-as-cong-raps-govt.html

“It is need of the hour that the Indian government send a plane to bring these Indian students back home,” Bhandari, who in the past has worked for the cause of the Indian diaspora, and who was approached by these students told PTI.

According to these students, some 100 of them have been at the airport since Tuesday.

They all have confirmed tickets but the airport authorities are not allowing them to check in because of the new travel regulations.

While the airport authorities have asked them to go back to their respective place of residence, the students said they were unable to travel because of the absence of local taxi or shared ride services.

The students said that they are running out of time as the Philippines government has given them 72 hours time to exit the country, which started from March 16, after which the country will go into lockdown.

“This means we would not be able to travel anywhere outside Philippines after March 20,” Nair said in her message.

The students said that there are many of them who have applied for renewal of their visas and are unable to travel to India.

There are nearly 1,000 Indian students presently in Manila who are willing to travel back home, they said.

Meanwhile, the Indian Embassy in Manila, in a tweet, said that they, along with the Ministry of External Affairs, are trying to work out a solution.

“It is requested to all to kindly have patience,” the embassy said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/distressed-indian-students-in-the-philippines-seek-help-to-get-back-home-2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/distressed-indian-students-in-the-philippines-seek-help-to-get-back-home.html
246,18-3-20,Novel coronavirus can remain stable on surfaces for hours to days: Study,"The novel coronavirus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, can be stable for several hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces, according to a new study which suggests that even people who do not yet show symptoms of the disease can spread the infection to others.

The research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, described the stability of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, noting that people may acquire the virus through the air, and after touching contaminated objects.

Researchers, including those from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the US, said SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours.

They said the virus can also remain stable for about four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and for two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.

In the research, the scientists compared how the environment affects SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, which caused the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic .

They said SARS-CoV-1, which was eradicated by intensive contact tracing and case isolation measures, is the human coronavirus most closely related to SARS-CoV-2.

The current study noted that the two viruses behaved similarly, which according to the scientists, fails to explain why COVID-19 has become a much larger outbreak.

The researchers attempted to mimic virus being deposited from an infected person onto everyday surfaces in a household or hospital setting, such as through coughing or touching objects.

They then assessed how long the virus remained infectious on these surfaces.

According to the scientists, people infected with SARS-CoV-2 might be spreading the virus without recognizing, or prior to recognizing, symptoms.

This would make disease control measures that were effective against SARS-CoV-1 less effective against its successor, they said.

In contrast to SARS-CoV-1, the study noted that most secondary cases of virus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appear to be occurring in community settings rather than healthcare settings.

However, healthcare settings are also vulnerable to the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2, and the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and on surfaces likely contributes to transmission of the virus in healthcare settings, the researchers said.

Based on the findings, they suggested that public health professionals use precautions similar to those for influenza and other respiratory viruses to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/novel-coronavirus-can-remain-stable-on-surfaces-for-hours-to-days--study-2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/novel-coronavirus-can-remain-stable-on-surfaces-for-hours-to-days--study.html
247,18-3-20,NKorea's Kim calls for better health care in hospital speech,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said it was “crucial” to improve his country's health care system during a groundbreaking ceremony for a general hospital, state media reported Wednesday, amid worries about the coronavirus in the impoverished North.

North Korea has been engaged in an intense campaign to guard against COVID-19, though it hasn't officially reported any cases of infection. Experts say North Korea is extremely vulnerable to an infectious disease due to its chronic lack of medical supplies and outdated medical infrastructure.

The Korean Central News Agency said Kim ordered the construction of the new ""modern general hospital” in Pyongyang to be completed before October's 75th founding anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party.

Kim said the state's efforts should be directed ""to prop up the field of public health,” KCNA said.

Kim also said his country's ruling party decided on building the hospital during a key party meeting in late December and was working to have it finished “in the shortest time.”

Some observers said North Korea may have hurried the construction since China reported the first cases of the new disease in late December and North Korea soon closed its borders in a disease-control measure.

Kim's attendance at the hospital ceremony also confirmed he returned to Pyongyang after supervising artillery firing exercises on North Korea's east coast. His visits to the rural coastal areas had prompted outside speculation he might have been trying to avoid the virus.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nkorea-s-kim-calls-for-better-health-care-in-hospital-speech-2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/nkorea-s-kim-calls-for-better-health-care-in-hospital-speech.html

250,18-3-20,Will not come in way of floor test in MP:SC,"Acknowledging that the fate of the Kamal Nath government is now in the hands of the 16 rebel MLAs, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will not come in the way of the Madhya Pradesh Assembly to decide on the floor test but asked how to ensure a free exercise of choice by the dissidents.

The 16 rebels, who the Congress alleged are being held captive by the BJP in Bengaluru, also offered to present themselves in the judges' chamber but the court rejected the proposal.

A bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta said the proposal would not be appropriate and also refused to send its Registrar General to meet them.

The court also said it wanted to allay apprehensions that the 16 rebels are being held captive,

As the nearly day-long hearing witnessed forceful arguments by top advocates representing various sides, the court asked the Speaker when will a decision be taken on the resignations of the 16 rebels.

Observing that the rebel MLAs may or may not go to the Assembly but cannot be held captive, the court said it was not going to come in the way of the legislature to decide as to who enjoys the trust but has to ensure there is a free exercise of choice which they can make.

After the arguments, the hearing of cross petitions filed by former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan and the Congress was adjourned for tomorrow at 10.30 am.

The opposition BJP is demanded an immediate floor test to test the majority of the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government.

The Congress said the floor test should be deferred till by-polls for the vacant seats arising out of the resignations are concluded, saying ""heavens are not going to fall"" if its government is allowed to remain in office till then.

The rebels for their part claimed they went to Bengaluru and were putting up in a resort voluntarily.

Releasing video messages, the rebels said they didn't want to meet senior party leader Digvijay Singh, who rushed to Bengaluru to woo them back.

High drama unfolded in the morning near the resort where Digvijay Singh staged a protest accusing the police of not allowing him to meet the legislators.

Singh, who was briefly detained, accused the BJP of holding the MLAs captive and said he would go on a ""hunger strike"".

During the hearing, the court said, ""It is their(rebels)choice whether they want to enter, comply with whips etc. But certainly, when allegation is that they are being held in captivity, we have to see they are at free will. These 16 either proceed to the floor or don't but surely they can't be held captive and how do we ensure this.""

""As a constitutional court, we have to discharge our duties,"" said the bench, adding, as of now it knows that the 16 rebel MLAs tilt the balance one way or the other.

The court then asked lawyers to assist it on the modalities for ensuring free access for the rebels to the Assembly and free exercise of choice.

When the counsel for Chouhan and the rebel MLAs asserted they are in Bengaluru at their own free will, the bench said, ""We are not saying they are held captive. Our concern is to allay the apprehension."" Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appeared for Chouhan while another senior advocate Maninder Singh represented the rebels.

At the fag end of the hearing, the bench put a poser to the Speaker as to whether he will decide on the resignations of MLAs if they appear before him tomorrow and said, ""a latest judgement asks the Speaker to decide quickly. Tell us when will you decide"".

To this, senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for the Speaker, said: ""I don't want the Speaker's discretion to be curtailed. I can inform about it tomorrow morning.""

But Maninder Singh intervened to say, ""We do not want to appear before the Speaker. It is a question of our safety.""

A total of 22 Congress MLAs including six ministers had resigned last week putting the government on the brink of collapse.

After the Speaker accepted the resignation of the six ministers on Saturday, the party now has 108 legislators.

The BJP has 107 seats in the House, which now has an effective strength of 222, with the majority mark being 112.

The strength of the ruling party and the majority mark will further come down if the resignations of the Congress rebels are accepted.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/will-not-come-in-way-of-floor-test-in-mp-sc-2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/will-not-come-in-way-of-floor-test-in-mp-sc.html
251,18-3-20,DAC clears procurement of 83 indigenously manufactured LCA Tejas's advanced version,"The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) on Wednesday cleared the procurement of 83 indigenously manufactured light combat aircraft Tejas's advanced version, the Defence Ministry said, a move that will help in shoring up IAF's depleting fleet.

The 83 Mk1A aircraft are in addition to the 40 Tejas aircraft whose orders have already been placed with the defence public sector undertaking Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.

The DAC's meeting was the first after the separation of duties between Department of Defence (DoD) and Department of Military Affairs (DMA) headed by Gen Bipin Rawat, the chief of defence staff.

The ministry said the indigenously developed LCA is going to be the ""backbone"" of the Indian Air Force.

""While order of 40 Tejas aircraft had been placed with HAL in initial configurations, DAC paved the way for procurement of 83 of the more advanced Mk1A version of the aircraft from HAL by finalising the contractual and other issues,"" the ministry said in a statement.

The proposal will now be placed for consideration of Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS).

The ministry has already begun the process to acquire a fleet of 110 more fighter jets.

This procurement will be a major boost to 'Make in India' as the aircraft is indigenously designed, developed and manufactured with participation of several local vendors apart from HAL, the ministry said.

The DAC also accorded approval for acquisition of indigenous defence equipment for about Rs 1,300 crore. The proposals were for procurement of aerial fuses and twin-dome simulators for Hawk Mk32 aircraft for the IAF.

The DAC also approved an amendment to the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2016 to enable review by a costing committee of bids submitted by joint ventures of Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) from whom procurement of defence items is undertaken on a nomination basis.

This will bring about more transparency in costs and compress the timelines for negotiation of the contract, the ministry added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dac-clears-procurement-of-83---indigenously-manufactured-lca-tejas-s-advanced-version-2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/dac-clears-procurement-of-83---indigenously-manufactured-lca-tejas-s-advanced-version.html
252,18-3-20,Over 54K under community surveillance: Govt,"Min lauds medics; Opp hails Govt over anti-corona steps

More than 54,000 persons are under community surveillance against the backdrop of coronavirus pandemic and the health workers are in regular touch with them, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan informed Parliament on Tuesday. People with flu-like symptoms but without a history of travel abroad are under community surveillance.

Informing the Rajya Sabha about measures taken to fight the pandemic, the Health Minister assured Rajya Sabha members that any complaint about reported unhygienic conditions in the quarantine is getting due attention.

Highlighting the role of the medical fraternity, Harsh Vardhan said, “As one metre social distancing is required to be taken while dealing with those affected with the virus, I laud doctors and paramedics who are working honestly with dedication while taking risks in treating these patients.”

“I laud all doctors and paramedics, be it in villages or cities or in private or Government in controlling coronavirus at all levels,” he told the House while replying to supplementaries during Question Hour. His remarks were lauded by all members, including those from the Opposition.

The Minister also urged MPs to visit quarantine facilities in their areas and suggest ways to help improve facilities. He noted that the response has been positive in appreciating the high quality treatment at quarantine facilities.

On reports about poor facilities at such centres, Harsh Vardhan said these reports are exceptions. “I can agree with you that the facilities may not be good. It is quite possible that at some places bathrooms may not be 5-star type. We are actiing in strongest possible manner on such complaints. These are rare complaints,” he said.

The Minister also said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientists are in touch with scientists all over the world regarding the use of retroviral drugs in treating coronavirus patients and in the research underway across the world in finding treatment of the virus.

Fielding questions on impact of the pandemic on tourism sector, Tourism Minister Prahlad Singh Patel said in the Upper House the Government’s immediate priority is to ensure safety of people and it will later evaluate losses incurred by the culture and tourism industry due to restrictions on visitors.

Responding to series of queries during the Question Hour, he said the Government has banned tourist visit and even Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) monuments and temples are shutdown.

Taking a view contrary to his former party president Rahul Gandhi, Congress MP Karti Chidambaram sprang a surprise in the Lok Sabha by complimenting the Union Government for its efforts to tackle coronavirus and said one should not “play politics” over the issue.

Rahul has all along been targeting the Modi Government’s response in tackling coronavirus and accusing it of being in stupor. Karti, however, pointed to complaints that people, being quarantined over coronavirus suspicion, have been kept in “substandard” facilities under “unhygienic” conditions. He said many of these people, most of whom were quarantined following their return from abroad, have the wherewithal for self-isolation and should be allowed to do so.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/over-54k-under-community-surveillance--govt-2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/over-54k-under-community-surveillance--govt.html
253,18-3-20,Accredited pvt labs set to conduct tests,"Govt suggests anti-HIV drug blend for treatment as cases rise to 137; death in Maha raises nationwide toll to 3

With 137 positive cases by Tuesday evening and three deaths, latest in Tuesday in Maharashtra, the Government has decided to rope in accredited private labs to conduct tests for the infection and recommended anti-HIV drug combination Lopinavir-Ritonavir on case-to-case basis for treatment of the viral infection.

At present only Government labs are permitted to do the test and the Centre is making arrangements to nearly double its testing capacity. A Union Health Ministry officials said that around 60 accredited private laboratories are likely to be given permission to conduct the tests soon. Confirmatory tests for COVID-19 are currently being done free-of cost at Government set-ups.

As per the guidelines issued by the Government for private labs, test should be only offered when prescribed by a qualified physician as per ICMR guidance for testing. Since the guidance evolves periodically, the latest revised version should be followed.

The guidelines state that the ICMR will share the SOPs for laboratory testing and provide positive controls for establishing the test as soon as the private laboratory concerned has procured the primers, probes and reagents as per SOPs. Adoption of commercial kits for testing should be based on validations conducted by lCMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.

It also states that appropriate biosafety and biosecurity precautions should be ensured while collecting samples from a suspect patient. Alternatively, a disease specific separate collection site may be created.

All the private testing laboratories have been asked to ensure immediate/real-time reporting to the State officials of IDSP (Integrated Disease Surveillance Program of Government of India) and ICMR HQ for timely initiation of contact tracing and research activities.

Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at ICMR, said the testing capacity is not an issue as per the capacity of 52 labs, India can conduct up to 10,000 tests per day at present.

“Around 600 samples are being tested per day,” he said, adding 60,000 testing kits are available now and additional 200,000 kits have been ordered.

According to the current testing protocols, only those with history of travel to high-risk countries affected by the respiratory virus and those who came in contact with positive patients have been asked to be quarantined for 14 days. Others with symptoms of the infection are being tested.

The official said the decision to allow anti-HIV drug combination on case-to-case basis follows the success in the treatment of an Italian elderly couple at Jaipur’s SMS hospital.

The couple had tested positive in the first week of March and their tests turned negative after being treated with the HIV drug.

As per its revised guidelines on the ‘Clinical Management of COVID - 19’ issued on Tuesday, the Ministry recommended Lopinavir-Ritonavir for high-risk groups patients aged above 60, suffering from diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease and are immuno-compromised.

To ascertain if there is any community transmission, the Ministry has also started random testing of people, who are suffering from respiratory ailments such as influenza and pneumonia but do not have a history of travel abroad.

Presently, around 1,040 samples of patients admitted at various hospitals, including private facilities, due to influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory ailments have been collected and majority of them have been tested to check if the virus has infected those without a history of travelling abroad.

So far, none of the samples has tested positive for COVID-19. The final results will be declared on Wednesday.

In the meantime, the Centre and States continued their strategy to keep the virus at bay. The Centre issued a fresh travel advisory on Tuesday prohibiting passengers from Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Malaysia from travelling to India with immediate effect while the States like Gujarat banned entry of visitors to the Statue of Unity till March 25.

Tourism activities in national parks and tiger reserves in Uttarakhand, including Corbett and Rajaji, were prohibited till March 31 on Tuesday as a precautionary measure against coronavirus, an official order said.

With Maharashtra reporting 41 cases and one death, the Mumbai police have ordered closure of orchestra/dance bars, discotheques, pubs, live bands and DJ performances in city till March 31 in view of coronavirus threat. Similarly, the Srinagar district administration on Tuesday announced a slew of additional measures, including plans of televised classes for students, to ensure that there is no outbreak of coronavirus in the city and the Valley.

As a prevention measure, the Air Force on Tuesday postponed scheduled test for airmen recruitment planned at 86 cities from March 19 to March 23 to the last week of April, while Naval base under Southern naval Command in a Press statement said that it is gearing up to provide quarantine facilities for Indian nationals being evacuated from Covid-19 affected countries. In a bid to ensure effective management of the virus, the Centre has deputed 30 officers of Joint Secretary and above level to assist the State Government in their efforts.

The Centre’s move to ban entry from more countries followed concern that most of the cases reported in India have been related with travel history abroad as so far no community transmission of the virus has been observed and there have only been a few cases of local transmission so far.

So far 137 cases have been reported including 22 foreign nationals. Delhi has so far reported seven positive cases, while Uttar Pradesh has recorded 13 cases, including one foreigner. Karnataka has eight coronavirus patients while Maharashtra 39, including 3 foreigners. Ladakh has reported four cases while Jammu and Kashmir three. Telangana has reported four cases.

Rajasthan has also reported four cases including that of two foreigners. Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab have reported one case each. Odisha reported its first case on Monday. In Haryana, there are 15 cases, which includes fourteen foreigners, while Uttarakhand has reported one case.

Kerala has recorded 24 cases, including two foreign nationals. The number also includes three patients who were discharged last month after they recovered from the contagious infection with flu-like symptoms.

According to the Ministry’s data, 13 people have been discharged so far which includes the three patients from Kerala.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/accredited-pvt-labs--set-to-conduct-tests.html
254,18-3-20,SC asks MP Govt to respond to floor test plea by 10.30 am,"After the Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Kamal Nath-led Congress Government in Madhya Pradesh to respond by Wednesday 10.30 am to a plea by senior BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan seeking immediate floor test in the Assembly, the MP Congress moved the SC seeking direction to the Centre and the Karnataka Government to grant it the access to its rebel MLAs.

The Congress urged the SC to declare as illegal the action of the Centre, the Karnataka Government and the BJP’s State unit of confining its MLAs in Bengaluru. It also sought a direction for rebel MLAs to participate in the Budget session. The trust vote should be held only in the presence of MLAs, said the plea by Govind Singh, party chief whip in MP.

Earlier, a bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta issued notices to the MP CM, the Speaker and Assembly Principal Secretary and said it will hear the plea of the BJP at 10.30 am on Wednesday. “In view of the urgency of the situation, the notice is made returnable at 10:30 am on March 18,” the SC said.

Former Chief Minister Chouhan and nine BJP MLAs, including the leader of Opposition and BJP’s Chief Whip in the Assembly approached the top court on Monday after the Speaker cited coronavirus concerns and adjourned the House till March 26 without taking the floor test apparently defying the directions of Governor Lalji Tandon.

“We have heard Mukul Rohatgi, senior counsel, along with Mishra Saurabh, Advocate-on-Record, appearing on behalf of the petitioners (Chouhan and others). In view of the urgency of the situation, the notice is made returnable at 10:30 am on 18 March 2020,” the bench said in its order.

The top court allowed Chouhan to serve the notice on the State Government and others “through e-mail in addition to the usual mode of service”.

The court also allowed 16 rebel Congress lawmakers, who have purportedly tendered their resignations to the Speaker, to file an application seeking impleadment as parties to the plea filed by Chouhan.

Senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for the rebel Congress MLAs, said that the resignations of six lawmakers, out of 22, have already been accepted and there was no reason for not accepting the resignations of the 16 MLAs.

“Maninder Singh, senior counsel, states that he would be filing an application for impleadment on behalf of the sixteen MLAs who, it is submitted, have tendered their resignations. A copy of the application shall be served on the contesting parties in the same mode as the petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. List the Writ Petition at 10:30 am tomorrow (18 March 2020),” the apex court’s order said.

At the outset, Rohatgi, appearing for the senior BJP leader and three-time Chief Minister, said: “The rationale in this case is that a floor test is required and usually the other side appears in such cases.

“This case represents complete travesty of democracy. The other side deliberately did not appear,” he said referring to the fact that nobody for the Chief Minister and the state government appeared in the court. He said the apex court has in the past heard such a case during night hours and the floor test were ordered.

Taking note of the submissions, the bench said, “We will have to issue a short notice and keep it for Wednesday morning.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sc-asks-mp-govt-to-respond-to-floor-test-plea-by-10-30-am.html

The actors, both 63, checked out of a Gold Coast medical facility on Tuesday after spending a week in self-isolation.

Hanks took to Instagram to give an update, his first, after their release from the hospital.

""Hey folks. Good News: One week after testing Positive, in self-isolation, the symptoms are much the same. No fever but the blahs,"" he said.

The ""Captain Phillips"" star wrote how he and Wilson were spending their time under self-quarantine.

257,18-3-20,"Novel coronavirus a product of natural evolution, not lab made: Study","The novel coronavirus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic is not artificially made, but the product of natural evolution, a new study says, ending widespread speculation and rumours that the virus may have been engineered in a lab.

In the study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers analysed the publicly available genome sequence data of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and related viruses.

The scientists, including those from The Scripps Research Institute in the US, said they did not find any evidence that the virus was made in a laboratory or otherwise engineered.

""By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes,"" said study co-author Kristian Andersen from The Scripps Research Institute.

They said the sequence data has shown that Chinese authorities rapidly detected the epidemic, and that the number of COVID-19 cases have been increasing because of human to human transmission after a single introduction into the human population.

Using this sequence data, the researchers traced the origins and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 by focusing on the tell-tale features of the virus.

To do this, the scientists said they analysed the genetic template for spike proteins -- armatures on the outside of the virus that it uses to grab and penetrate the outer walls of human and animal cells.

The study focused on two important features of the spike protein -- the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a kind of grappling hook that grips onto host cells, and the cleavage site, a molecular can opener that allows the virus to crack open and enter host cells.

According to the study, the RBD portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins had evolved to effectively target a molecular feature on the outside of human cells called ACE2 -- a receptor protein involved in regulating blood pressure.

The spike protein of the novel coronavirus was so effective at binding the human cells that the researchers said it was the result of natural selection and not the product of genetic engineering.

They said this was supported by data on SARS-CoV-2's overall molecular structure.

If the new coronavirus were engineered as a pathogen, the scientists said, it must have been constructed from the backbone of a virus already known to cause illness.

But the study found that SARS-CoV-2's backbone differed substantially from those of already known coronaviruses, and mostly resembled related viruses found in bats and pangolins.

""These two features of the virus, the mutations in the RBD portion of the spike protein and its distinct backbone, rules out laboratory manipulation as a potential origin for SARS-CoV-2,"" Andersen said.

The researchers said the findings are crucially important to bring an evidence-based view to the rumours that have been circulating about the origins of SARS-CoV-2.

Based on their genomic sequencing analysis, Andersen and his team concluded that the most likely origins for SARS-CoV-2 followed one of two possible scenarios.

In one scenario, they said, the virus may have evolved to its current pathogenic state through natural selection in a non-human host and then jumped to humans.

The researchers said previous coronavirus outbreaks emerged in a similar way, with humans contracting the virus after direct exposure to civets (SARS), and camels (MERS).

They proposed that bats are the most likely reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 as the virus is very similar to a bat coronavirus.

However, they said there are no documented cases of direct bat-human transmission, suggesting that an intermediate host was likely involved between bats and humans.

In this scenario, they said both the distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2's spike protein -- the RBD portion that binds to cells, and the cleavage site that opens the virus up -- may have evolved to their current state prior to entering humans.

The scientists noted that in this case, the current epidemic would probably have emerged rapidly as soon as humans were infected, as the virus would have already evolved the features that make it pathogenic, and able to spread between people.

They added that a non-pathogenic version of the virus may have jumped from an animal host into humans, and then evolved to its current disease-causing state within the human population.

Citing an example, the researchers said, some coronaviruses from pangolins -- armadillo-like mammals found in Asia and Africa -- have an RBD structure very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2.

They said a coronavirus from a pangolin may have been transmitted to a human, either directly, or through an intermediary host such as civets or ferrets.

The distinct spike protein characteristic of SARS-CoV-2, the cleavage site, may have then evolved within a human host, possibly through limited undetected circulation in the human population prior to the beginning of the epidemic, the study said.

The scientists also found that the SARS-CoV-2 cleavage site appeared similar to the cleavage sites of strains of bird flu that had been shown to transmit easily between people.

They speculated that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved such a virulent cleavage site in human cells, and soon kicked off the current epidemic, as the coronavirus would possibly have become far more capable of spreading between people.

However, the scientists cautioned that it is difficult, if not impossible, to know at this point which of the scenarios is most likely.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/novel-coronavirus-a-product-of-natural-evolution--not-lab-made--study-2020-03-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/novel-coronavirus-a-product-of-natural-evolution--not-lab-made--study.html

In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan said the medical supplies included one lakh surgical masks, five lakh pairs of surgical gloves, 75 pieces of infusion pumps, 30 pieces of enteral feeding pumps, 21 pieces of defibrillator and 4,000 pieces of N-95 masks.

These medical supplies cost approximately Rs 2.11 crore and were handed over to the Hubei Charity Federation in Wuhan, Muraleedharan said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had written to Chinese President Xi Jinping on February 8, 2020, in view of the coronavirus outbreak in China, conveying the solidarity of the Indian government and its people with the neighbouring nation and the readiness to provide assistance, he said.

The government provided 15 tonnes of medical supplies comprising masks, gloves and other emergency medical equipment to China on February 26, 2020, he said.

These supplies were delivered by an Indian Air Force C-17 special flight which landed in Wuhan, China, Muraleedharan said.

To a separate question, he said the government organised three special flights on January 31, February 1 and February 26 to evacuate 766 people, including students, from Wuhan as well as other cities of Hubei province in China in view of the continuing lockdown of the province.

266,18-3-20,Did Ranbir Kapoor go missing on Alia Bhatt's birthday?,"Alia Bhatt was spotted with elder sister Shaheen and good friend Akansha Ranjan Kapoor on her birthday on March 15, and not with rumoured boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor, so a section of the media was quick to speculate all is not well between the two!

Alia celebrated her special day with the girl gang and a video showing the actress cutting two birthday cakes has gone viral. Wishes poured in from friends and colleagues in the film fraternity including her mother Soni Razdan and Ranbir's mother Neetu Singh, but there was no message from Ranbir, if a report in the website odishatv.in is to be believed.

Incidentally, a day after Alia's birthday, Natasha Poonawalla took to Instagram to share an old picture where Ranbir is seen planting a kiss on a grinning Alia's cheek, even as Arjun Kapoor and Malaika Arora hug and kiss in the background. The picture was taken in New York, indiatoday.in reported.

Although Alia and Ranbir have neither confirmed nor denied being in a relationship, a section of the media is always over-eager to hunt for signs that attest love and/or breakup. Just the other day, many in the Bollywood media were excitedly reporting of a possible December wedding for the two stars. While Ranbir and Alia have maintained silence over all such talk, some among the mediapersons even claimed guest lists had already been drawn out for the wedding, which would reportedly happen once the Ranbir-Alia starrer ""Brahmastra"" released in the year end.

""Brahmastra"" is Ranbir's first film with Alia, and is directed by his close friend Ayan Mukerji, who called the shots on the Ranbir Kapoor hits ""Wake Up Sid"" (2009) and ""Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani"" (2013) before this. The film is touted as the first of an ambitious superhero action trilogy, and it also stars Amitabh Bachchan, Nagarjuna and Mouni Roy.

267,18-3-20,"Facebook bug removes legit posts, news on coronavirus","A massive bug in Facebook has removed several legitimate posts, news and comments about new coronavirus from some leading media outlets like USA Today, Buzzfead and Medium.

Aimed at curtailing the spread of fake and mischievous health information around COVID-19, Facebook's News Feed spam filter blocked URLs of legitimate websites.

""It looks like an anti-spam rule at FB is going haywire. Facebook sent home content moderators yesterday, who generally can't WFH (work from home) due to privacy commitments the company has made. We might be seeing the start of the ML going nuts with less human oversight,"" tweeted former chief security officer at Facebook.

Guy Rosen, Vice President, Product Management at Facebook replied: ""We're on this - this is a bug in an anti-spam system, unrelated to any changes in our content moderator workforce. We're in the process of fixing and bringing all these posts back"".

Later, he said Facebook has ""restored all the posts that were incorrectly removed, which included posts on all topics - not just those related to COVID-19"".

According to the company, this was an issue with an automated system that removes links to abusive websites, ""but incorrectly removed a lot of other posts too"".

A Twitter user posted: ""It's not just news articles. A community flier asking for emergency donations of food to the needy in our community was blocked. A friend in Canada had posts from Royal Canadian Mounted Police blocked. It's very widespread"".

Top tech giants Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter and YouTube have come together to help fight the fake news and misinformation related to COVID-19 on their platforms.

Facebook and Instagram have already announced to ban ads and commerce listings selling medical face masks on their platforms to stop people from exploiting the coronavirus emergency.

Facebook said that coronavirus-related searches on its platform would be greeted with an automatic pop-up featuring information from the WHO.

274,18-3-20,Indian carriers may ground 150 planes; stare at quarterly loss on coronavirus impact: Report,"All Indian airlines will report significant losses in the first quarter of this year and may initially ground around 150 planes as the shock from the coronavirus pandemic will be ""far deeper and much longer"", according to a report.

Aviation advisory firm CAPA India on Wednesday said consolidated losses are estimated to be in the range of USD 500-600 million for the quarter, excluding Air India.

In a report, it said that some airlines may choose to temporarily shut down their operations by design on the basis that demand is so low that such action would result in reduced losses than if they continue to operate.

As per the report, even before COVID-19 (coronavirus) appeared on the scene, most Indian carriers already had very strained balance sheets and almost no liquidity.

""This latest shock will once again expose the vulnerability of India's aviation system as happened during the fuel price spike in 2008. But on that occasion the shock was short-lived, even if its impact reverberated for several years. This time, the shock itself will be far deeper and much longer,"" it said.

In the wake of significant reduction in services, the report said Indian carriers might initially ground around 150 aircraft, and the number is expected to increase as more domestic operations are curtailed over the coming weeks.

At present, the combined fleet of six major domestic carriers stands at around 650 planes.

""If the decline in traffic continues to be severe, the majority of the fleet could be grounded by April,"" it noted.

While noting that it does not want to be ""alarmist,"" CAPA India said the situation continues to deteriorate.

In India, the number of coronavirus cases rose to 151 on Wednesday. Close to 8,000 deaths have been reported worldwide due to the pandemic and many countries, including India, have imposed travel restrictions.

Against this backdrop, Air India and IndiGo have cancelled some of their international flights while GoAir has temporarily suspended its overseas services.

CAPA India noted that all Indian airlines would report significant losses in the first quarter even with oil prices at around USD 30 per barrel.

""At an industry level, consolidated losses are estimated to be in the range of USD 500-600 mn for the quarter (excluding Air India). However, these are very preliminary estimates and are subject to further downward revision.

""In the absence of serious and meaningful government intervention, such an outcome could lead to several Indian airlines shutting down operations by May or June due to a lack of cash,"" it said.
